00:00:10,886 --> 0:00:11,956
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon everyone.

00:00:12,121 --> 0:00:14,121
[ Applause ]

5
00:00:14,226 --> 0:00:16,436
As you just saw, privacy is

6
00:00:16,436 --> 0:00:18,736
something people expect, value,

7
00:00:18,846 --> 0:00:21,316
and make space for every day.

8
00:00:21,376 --> 0:00:23,336
I'm Mark from Privacy

9
00:00:23,336 --> 0:00:24,736
Engineering Team at Apple, and

10
00:00:24,736 --> 0:00:26,196
with my colleague, Julien, we're

11
00:00:26,196 --> 0:00:27,926
thrilled to tell you today about

12
00:00:27,926 --> 0:00:29,646
designing for privacy on our

13
00:00:29,646 --> 0:00:31,366
platforms and in your

14
00:00:31,366 --> 0:00:32,156
applications.

15
00:00:34,096 --> 0:00:36,126
Privacy isn't just about closing

16
00:00:36,126 --> 0:00:36,606
doors.

17
00:00:37,226 --> 0:00:39,516
It's also about opening doors to

18
00:00:39,516 --> 0:00:41,086
the trust you build with your

19
00:00:41,126 --> 0:00:41,736
customers.

20
00:00:43,516 --> 0:00:45,296
Customers have let our devices

21
00:00:45,436 --> 0:00:48,586
into their homes, captured the

22
00:00:48,586 --> 0:00:50,596
memories in their photos,

23
00:00:52,326 --> 0:00:54,486
monitor their health, and

24
00:00:54,686 --> 0:00:56,196
transmit their thoughts and

25
00:00:56,196 --> 0:00:58,356
emotions, knowing that they are

26
00:00:58,356 --> 0:00:59,726
in control of their data.

27
00:01:02,436 --> 0:01:04,976
As Tim said last year, we at

28
00:01:04,976 --> 0:01:07,526
Apple can and do provide the

29
00:01:07,596 --> 0:01:09,876
very best to our users while

30
00:01:09,876 --> 0:01:11,076
treating their most precious

31
00:01:11,076 --> 0:01:12,776
data like the precious cargo

32
00:01:12,986 --> 0:01:13,606
that it is.

33
00:01:13,606 --> 0:01:17,066
And if we can do it, then every

34
00:01:17,066 --> 0:01:19,206
one of you can, and in today's

35
00:01:19,206 --> 0:01:21,746
talk, we'll help you design for

36
00:01:21,746 --> 0:01:21,976
privacy.

37
00:01:25,086 --> 0:01:28,406
At Apple, privacy starts with

38
00:01:28,406 --> 0:01:29,526
data minimization.

39
00:01:30,786 --> 0:01:32,756
Examine carefully what data do

40
00:01:32,756 --> 0:01:34,066
you need for the functionality

41
00:01:34,066 --> 0:01:35,806
of your app, and what data can

42
00:01:35,806 --> 0:01:36,396
you edit out?

43
00:01:39,426 --> 0:01:40,996
Some of the most interesting and

44
00:01:40,996 --> 0:01:42,726
challenging features use

45
00:01:42,726 --> 0:01:45,356
sensitive, personal data, and at

46
00:01:45,356 --> 0:01:47,516
Apple, we build these features

47
00:01:47,766 --> 0:01:50,126
with on device intelligence, so

48
00:01:50,126 --> 0:01:52,396
your device personalizes itself

49
00:01:52,566 --> 0:01:54,756
to you, while Apple doesn't

50
00:01:54,756 --> 0:01:55,566
collect this data.

51
00:01:58,506 --> 0:02:00,096
When data is shared with Apple,

52
00:01:58,506 --> 0:02:00,096
When data is shared with Apple,

53
00:02:00,336 --> 0:02:01,326
we ask the customer.

54
00:02:02,446 --> 0:02:03,626
The customer is always in

55
00:02:03,626 --> 0:02:05,766
control, and they always know

56
00:02:06,076 --> 0:02:06,906
what's being shared.

57
00:02:06,906 --> 0:02:11,706
And security is foundational.

58
00:02:12,506 --> 0:02:13,946
It not only protects people's

59
00:02:13,946 --> 0:02:16,166
data on their devices and on our

60
00:02:16,166 --> 0:02:19,886
servers but also enforces both

61
00:02:19,886 --> 0:02:21,356
the privacy protections we've

62
00:02:21,406 --> 0:02:23,236
built and the choices that

63
00:02:23,236 --> 0:02:26,836
people have made.

64
00:02:26,836 --> 0:02:27,856
Some companies think that

65
00:02:27,856 --> 0:02:30,766
privacy is just security, that

66
00:02:30,766 --> 0:02:32,316
you can use or collect data so

67
00:02:32,316 --> 0:02:33,026
long as you protect it.

68
00:02:33,026 --> 0:02:35,956
But that's short sighted, as

69
00:02:35,956 --> 0:02:37,866
security alone isn't adequate in

70
00:02:37,866 --> 0:02:38,366
the long run.

71
00:02:38,366 --> 0:02:41,556
You do have a responsibility to

72
00:02:41,556 --> 0:02:42,416
protect the data that you

73
00:02:42,416 --> 0:02:44,496
collect, but it's less risky to

74
00:02:44,496 --> 0:02:45,866
just not collect it in the first

75
00:02:45,866 --> 0:02:46,196
place.

76
00:02:48,996 --> 0:02:50,236
Some other companies define

77
00:02:50,236 --> 0:02:52,276
privacy as just transparency and

78
00:02:52,276 --> 0:02:52,676
control.

79
00:02:53,536 --> 0:02:55,026
Let users know what you're doing

80
00:02:55,026 --> 0:02:56,616
with their data, and let them

81
00:02:56,616 --> 0:02:58,216
opt out if they don't like it.

82
00:02:59,586 --> 0:03:01,516
But this is privacy after the

83
00:02:59,586 --> 0:03:01,516
But this is privacy after the

84
00:03:01,516 --> 0:03:04,646
fact, and it forces people to

85
00:03:04,646 --> 0:03:06,676
choose between privacy and

86
00:03:06,746 --> 0:03:07,286
features.

87
00:03:07,336 --> 0:03:09,926
And the burden shouldn't be on

88
00:03:09,926 --> 0:03:12,266
individuals to exercise control

89
00:03:12,556 --> 0:03:13,556
to get privacy.

90
00:03:15,676 --> 0:03:17,176
Because privacy is a fundamental

91
00:03:17,176 --> 0:03:17,756
human right.

92
00:03:17,756 --> 0:03:20,036
It's essential to the

93
00:03:20,036 --> 0:03:21,666
functioning of good societies,

94
00:03:21,946 --> 0:03:24,536
and it's too important to not

95
00:03:24,536 --> 0:03:26,486
just work in the technologies

96
00:03:26,486 --> 0:03:27,206
that we use.

97
00:03:27,366 --> 0:03:30,626
That's why at Apple, privacy is

98
00:03:30,626 --> 0:03:32,376
designed into our futures.

99
00:03:33,066 --> 0:03:34,526
It's [inaudible] how they work,

100
00:03:35,186 --> 0:03:36,666
not something added on at the

101
00:03:36,666 --> 0:03:36,956
end.

102
00:03:37,076 --> 0:03:40,306
At Apple, we challenge ourselves

103
00:03:40,376 --> 0:03:42,026
every day to build great

104
00:03:42,026 --> 0:03:44,226
features with privacy, and we're

105
00:03:44,226 --> 0:03:47,436
confident you can too.

106
00:03:48,026 --> 0:03:50,296
In the rest of our talk, we'll

107
00:03:50,296 --> 0:03:51,876
explore privacy and the user

108
00:03:51,876 --> 0:03:52,526
experience.

109
00:03:53,406 --> 0:03:55,416
Dive into what's new and updated

110
00:03:55,416 --> 0:03:57,566
in frameworks, and then we'll

111
00:03:57,566 --> 0:03:59,426
take a step back and show how

112
00:03:59,426 --> 0:04:00,806
you can overcome privacy

113
00:03:59,426 --> 0:04:00,806
you can overcome privacy

114
00:04:00,806 --> 0:04:02,396
challenges through innovation.

115
00:04:04,556 --> 0:04:06,046
I'm going to talk about four

116
00:04:06,046 --> 0:04:07,176
user experiences today.

117
00:04:09,456 --> 0:04:12,136
First, Sign In with Apple, which

118
00:04:12,136 --> 0:04:12,956
allows you to connect your

119
00:04:12,956 --> 0:04:14,586
user's experience across

120
00:04:14,656 --> 0:04:16,426
platforms without having to

121
00:04:16,426 --> 0:04:17,606
store or manage user

122
00:04:17,606 --> 0:04:20,745
credentials, and it's a great

123
00:04:20,745 --> 0:04:22,366
example of data minimization.

124
00:04:22,866 --> 0:04:25,206
Apple doesn't track how people

125
00:04:25,206 --> 0:04:27,266
use your application because

126
00:04:27,266 --> 0:04:29,506
it's none of our business, and

127
00:04:29,836 --> 0:04:31,146
we've pared down the data that

128
00:04:31,146 --> 0:04:32,246
people share through Sign In

129
00:04:32,246 --> 0:04:34,036
with Apple to just what's needed

130
00:04:34,036 --> 0:04:35,316
to sign into your application.

131
00:04:36,546 --> 0:04:37,786
So, ask yourself if you really

132
00:04:37,786 --> 0:04:39,106
need the customer's name or

133
00:04:39,106 --> 0:04:39,876
email address.

134
00:04:40,736 --> 0:04:42,886
If you need a name for billing

135
00:04:42,886 --> 0:04:44,236
or shipping purposes, you can

136
00:04:44,236 --> 0:04:45,506
get it later, for example,

137
00:04:45,686 --> 0:04:46,346
through Apple Pay.

138
00:04:46,346 --> 0:04:49,226
And if you don't ask for any

139
00:04:49,226 --> 0:04:50,996
additional data, the user has

140
00:04:50,996 --> 0:04:53,046
just one button to tap, and

141
00:04:53,046 --> 0:04:53,706
they're signed into your

142
00:04:53,706 --> 0:04:54,206
application.

143
00:04:55,686 --> 0:04:57,766
If you do need to contact the

144
00:04:57,766 --> 0:04:59,316
user, for example, to provide

145
00:04:59,316 --> 0:05:00,536
receipts or for account

146
00:04:59,316 --> 0:05:00,536
receipts or for account

147
00:05:00,536 --> 0:05:02,916
recovery, we provide an easy way

148
00:05:02,916 --> 0:05:03,586
for you to do so.

149
00:05:04,276 --> 0:05:07,196
People can be hesitant to share

150
00:05:07,196 --> 0:05:08,336
their real email address.

151
00:05:08,926 --> 0:05:09,936
We've all seen email lists

152
00:05:10,006 --> 0:05:13,686
stolen or resold and then abused

153
00:05:13,686 --> 0:05:14,416
by spammers.

154
00:05:15,136 --> 0:05:16,526
So people may give you a fake

155
00:05:16,526 --> 0:05:18,286
email address or one for an

156
00:05:18,286 --> 0:05:20,396
account they never check.

157
00:05:20,616 --> 0:05:21,996
You could make the user verify

158
00:05:21,996 --> 0:05:23,616
their email at sign-in, but this

159
00:05:23,646 --> 0:05:24,536
takes them out of your

160
00:05:24,536 --> 0:05:26,556
application, potentially to

161
00:05:26,556 --> 0:05:27,306
[inaudible] their spam folder,

162
00:05:27,306 --> 0:05:28,756
and that's not a great

163
00:05:28,756 --> 0:05:29,386
experience.

164
00:05:30,436 --> 0:05:31,796
With sign-in with Apple, you

165
00:05:31,796 --> 0:05:33,526
will get a verified email

166
00:05:33,526 --> 0:05:35,526
address associated with the

167
00:05:35,526 --> 0:05:36,386
user's AppleID.

168
00:05:37,856 --> 0:05:40,036
Customers can choose to hide

169
00:05:40,036 --> 0:05:41,676
their email address, in which

170
00:05:41,676 --> 0:05:43,056
case you'll get an address

171
00:05:43,206 --> 0:05:45,106
managed by Apple through which

172
00:05:45,106 --> 0:05:46,756
we relay your emails to the

173
00:05:46,756 --> 0:05:48,176
customer and vice versa.

174
00:05:48,476 --> 0:05:50,526
And Apple won't retain emails

175
00:05:50,606 --> 0:05:52,436
after we've delivered them.

176
00:05:53,066 --> 0:05:54,636
For each customer, this managed

177
00:05:54,636 --> 0:05:56,036
address is different for each

178
00:05:56,036 --> 0:05:58,316
developer, so customers are in

179
00:05:58,316 --> 0:06:00,116
control of which developers they

180
00:05:58,316 --> 0:06:00,116
control of which developers they

181
00:06:00,116 --> 0:06:02,286
want to receive email from, and

182
00:06:02,286 --> 0:06:03,866
you're in control of who can

183
00:06:03,866 --> 0:06:05,096
send emails to the managed

184
00:06:05,096 --> 0:06:06,906
address we provide you, since

185
00:06:06,906 --> 0:06:08,266
you can whitelist domains or

186
00:06:08,266 --> 0:06:09,836
addresses that we'll accept

187
00:06:09,836 --> 0:06:10,716
incoming mail from.

188
00:06:10,886 --> 0:06:12,946
And because both parties are in

189
00:06:12,946 --> 0:06:14,596
control, we think this is your

190
00:06:14,636 --> 0:06:16,536
best shot at getting your emails

191
00:06:16,536 --> 0:06:17,726
in front of your customer.

192
00:06:20,676 --> 0:06:22,306
We understand you face

193
00:06:22,306 --> 0:06:23,966
challenges in preventing abuse

194
00:06:24,026 --> 0:06:25,386
and fraud from account farming.

195
00:06:25,386 --> 0:06:27,966
And you may want to ask users to

196
00:06:27,966 --> 0:06:29,336
fill out a CAPTCHA such as this.

197
00:06:29,946 --> 0:06:31,466
But these are cumbersome, and

198
00:06:31,466 --> 0:06:32,676
they're difficult to localize

199
00:06:32,676 --> 0:06:35,796
and make accessible.

200
00:06:35,796 --> 0:06:37,216
Other alternatives are invasive

201
00:06:37,216 --> 0:06:39,316
to user's privacy, such as

202
00:06:39,366 --> 0:06:40,716
trying to reidentify them with

203
00:06:40,716 --> 0:06:41,716
personally identifiable

204
00:06:41,716 --> 0:06:43,496
information or fingerprinting.

205
00:06:43,496 --> 0:06:46,436
With Sign In with Apple, we can

206
00:06:46,516 --> 0:06:48,956
leverage on-device intelligence

207
00:06:49,326 --> 0:06:51,466
to provide you with one bit that

208
00:06:51,466 --> 0:06:53,126
indicates a user is likely real.

209
00:06:53,126 --> 0:06:56,016
And this flag is supported on

210
00:06:56,016 --> 0:06:57,626
iOS, and we provide it at

211
00:06:57,626 --> 0:06:58,426
account creation.

212
00:07:01,436 --> 0:07:03,296
The real user status property of

213
00:07:03,296 --> 0:07:05,336
ASAuthorizationAppleIDCredential

214
00:07:05,656 --> 0:07:06,776
is how you check for this bit.

215
00:07:06,876 --> 0:07:09,546
And keep in mind that a new user

216
00:07:09,716 --> 0:07:11,596
on a new phone will likely show

217
00:07:11,596 --> 0:07:13,326
up as status unknown, so you

218
00:07:13,326 --> 0:07:14,676
shouldn't just deny service if

219
00:07:14,676 --> 0:07:16,386
you see this state and provide

220
00:07:16,386 --> 0:07:17,796
the user and ultimate flow or a

221
00:07:18,136 --> 0:07:19,236
way to appeal this

222
00:07:19,236 --> 0:07:19,756
determination.

223
00:07:19,756 --> 0:07:23,516
So that was Sign In with Apple,

224
00:07:23,666 --> 0:07:25,576
a great privacy friendly single

225
00:07:25,576 --> 0:07:26,346
sign on solution.

226
00:07:28,216 --> 0:07:29,356
Now, let's talk about location.

227
00:07:30,486 --> 0:07:32,046
People are protective of where

228
00:07:32,046 --> 0:07:33,606
they are and where they've been.

229
00:07:33,746 --> 0:07:38,126
It reveals where we live, places

230
00:07:38,126 --> 0:07:40,116
we frequent, our patterns of

231
00:07:40,116 --> 0:07:41,466
life, and when those patterns

232
00:07:41,466 --> 0:07:42,056
change.

233
00:07:42,956 --> 0:07:44,186
Like if you start attending a

234
00:07:44,186 --> 0:07:45,436
different set of afterparties

235
00:07:45,436 --> 0:07:46,756
this year with a different crowd

236
00:07:46,756 --> 0:07:47,076
of people.

237
00:07:47,076 --> 0:07:49,836
And in iOS 13, we're making

238
00:07:49,836 --> 0:07:51,836
changes to help users exercise

239
00:07:52,066 --> 0:07:53,986
smarter control over when

240
00:07:53,986 --> 0:07:55,056
they're sharing their location.

241
00:07:57,206 --> 0:07:58,796
Previously in iOS, there was a

242
00:07:58,856 --> 0:08:00,576
one-time prompt for location

243
00:07:58,856 --> 0:08:00,576
one-time prompt for location

244
00:08:00,576 --> 0:08:03,646
permissions, and at this point,

245
00:08:03,646 --> 0:08:04,876
the user hasn't experienced

246
00:08:04,876 --> 0:08:07,386
location in your app before.

247
00:08:07,446 --> 0:08:08,936
So they may select don't allow

248
00:08:08,966 --> 0:08:10,696
and miss out on the value that

249
00:08:10,696 --> 0:08:11,996
location can provide in your

250
00:08:11,996 --> 0:08:12,546
application.

251
00:08:12,636 --> 0:08:14,976
And while many of you have built

252
00:08:14,976 --> 0:08:16,706
experiences to explain your use

253
00:08:16,706 --> 0:08:18,276
of location before asking,

254
00:08:19,056 --> 0:08:20,206
nothing explains better than

255
00:08:20,206 --> 0:08:20,916
using your app.

256
00:08:22,106 --> 0:08:23,956
So, in iOS 13 were introducing a

257
00:08:23,956 --> 0:08:27,686
new option, Allow Once, giving

258
00:08:27,686 --> 0:08:29,916
users the ability to try out

259
00:08:29,916 --> 0:08:31,336
location in your application

260
00:08:31,766 --> 0:08:33,176
before committing to a decision.

261
00:08:33,635 --> 0:08:36,446
If the user selects Allow Once,

262
00:08:36,946 --> 0:08:38,056
your app will have access to

263
00:08:38,056 --> 0:08:39,566
location, just as if the user

264
00:08:39,566 --> 0:08:42,126
had selected While in Use up

265
00:08:42,126 --> 0:08:43,515
until the system no longer

266
00:08:43,515 --> 0:08:45,116
considers your app in use.

267
00:08:45,596 --> 0:08:46,766
The next time the user launches

268
00:08:46,766 --> 0:08:47,786
your app, they'll be asked

269
00:08:47,786 --> 0:08:49,816
again, and if they want to give

270
00:08:49,816 --> 0:08:51,026
you app access without being

271
00:08:51,026 --> 0:08:52,476
asked, they can grant While in

272
00:08:52,476 --> 0:08:53,736
Use when they're comfortable

273
00:08:53,736 --> 0:08:54,196
doing so.

274
00:08:55,766 --> 0:08:56,666
What about Always?

275
00:08:57,576 --> 0:08:58,756
The ability to access a user's

276
00:08:58,756 --> 0:09:00,296
location always is a very

277
00:08:58,756 --> 0:09:00,296
location always is a very

278
00:09:00,296 --> 0:09:02,246
powerful capability, and you

279
00:09:02,246 --> 0:09:03,776
just may be surprised if your

280
00:09:03,776 --> 0:09:05,396
app asks for it right away

281
00:09:05,916 --> 0:09:06,836
before you've had a chance to

282
00:09:06,836 --> 0:09:08,086
demonstrate your app's value,

283
00:09:09,046 --> 0:09:10,106
the value of location in your

284
00:09:10,106 --> 0:09:11,816
app's value, or why you need it

285
00:09:11,816 --> 0:09:12,956
in the background when they're

286
00:09:12,996 --> 0:09:15,736
currently using your app.

287
00:09:15,936 --> 0:09:18,326
Location prompts in app will now

288
00:09:18,366 --> 0:09:21,086
always be for just once or While

289
00:09:21,086 --> 0:09:21,526
in Use.

290
00:09:22,196 --> 0:09:25,536
If you do request Always, we'll

291
00:09:25,536 --> 0:09:27,296
show the same prompt and defer

292
00:09:27,296 --> 0:09:28,506
asking for Always.

293
00:09:28,766 --> 0:09:31,686
And if a user selects While in

294
00:09:31,686 --> 0:09:33,786
Use, your delegate object will

295
00:09:33,786 --> 0:09:35,556
be told you're authorized for

296
00:09:35,556 --> 0:09:36,006
always.

297
00:09:37,286 --> 0:09:38,566
And iOS will continue to

298
00:09:38,566 --> 0:09:40,336
generate Always location events

299
00:09:40,336 --> 0:09:41,226
for your app, just as it did

300
00:09:41,296 --> 0:09:41,646
before.

301
00:09:43,286 --> 0:09:45,046
Before we deliver the first

302
00:09:45,046 --> 0:09:46,386
Always location event to your

303
00:09:46,386 --> 0:09:48,666
application, we'll then prompt

304
00:09:48,666 --> 0:09:50,276
the user to upgrade from While

305
00:09:50,276 --> 0:09:52,896
in Use to Always, and you'll

306
00:09:52,896 --> 0:09:54,226
only get the location event if

307
00:09:54,436 --> 0:09:55,666
the user grants us permission.

308
00:09:57,096 --> 0:09:58,836
We'll only ask users while

309
00:09:58,836 --> 0:09:59,986
they're on the home screen, not

310
00:09:59,986 --> 0:10:00,706
while they're in another

311
00:09:59,986 --> 0:10:00,706
while they're in another

312
00:10:00,706 --> 0:10:02,416
application, so this may not

313
00:10:02,456 --> 0:10:02,976
happen immediately.

314
00:10:05,736 --> 0:10:06,886
To provide increased

315
00:10:06,886 --> 0:10:08,916
transparency, we'll periodically

316
00:10:08,916 --> 0:10:10,526
remind the user that your app is

317
00:10:10,526 --> 0:10:11,706
accessing location in the

318
00:10:11,706 --> 0:10:12,196
background.

319
00:10:13,496 --> 0:10:15,176
And shortly after upgrade to iOS

320
00:10:15,176 --> 0:10:17,196
13, we'll remind the user for

321
00:10:17,196 --> 0:10:18,826
all existing apps with Always

322
00:10:18,826 --> 0:10:18,976
access.

323
00:10:21,476 --> 0:10:23,586
The good news is, there are no

324
00:10:23,586 --> 0:10:25,716
capability breaking API changes,

325
00:10:26,436 --> 0:10:27,546
but you should test for the new

326
00:10:27,546 --> 0:10:29,476
Allow Once and Always behaviors

327
00:10:29,476 --> 0:10:31,106
to ensure that your app handles

328
00:10:31,106 --> 0:10:32,036
these state transitions

329
00:10:32,036 --> 0:10:32,456
gracefully.

330
00:10:32,456 --> 0:10:35,516
And if you do use Always data,

331
00:10:35,726 --> 0:10:37,046
now is a good time to ensure

332
00:10:37,046 --> 0:10:38,686
that your use of Always provides

333
00:10:38,686 --> 0:10:39,696
clear user value.

334
00:10:41,096 --> 0:10:42,076
We think these contextual

335
00:10:42,076 --> 0:10:43,736
prompts will help users make

336
00:10:43,736 --> 0:10:45,736
informed, smarter choices about

337
00:10:45,736 --> 0:10:46,646
when they're sharing their

338
00:10:46,646 --> 0:10:47,106
location.

339
00:10:48,456 --> 0:10:49,736
Come talk to us at our lab if

340
00:10:49,736 --> 0:10:51,286
you have any questions, check

341
00:10:51,286 --> 0:10:52,566
out the video from What's New in

342
00:10:52,566 --> 0:10:54,296
Core Location session in the

343
00:10:54,296 --> 0:10:56,026
WWDC app or the Core Location

344
00:10:56,026 --> 0:11:00,696
lab Friday at 1 p.m. The third

345
00:10:56,026 --> 0:11:00,696
lab Friday at 1 p.m. The third

346
00:11:00,696 --> 0:11:01,886
user experience I'm going to

347
00:11:01,886 --> 0:11:03,306
talk about is Bluetooth.

348
00:11:03,976 --> 0:11:05,836
You used to only need user

349
00:11:05,836 --> 0:11:07,336
consent if you wanted to share

350
00:11:07,336 --> 0:11:08,626
information using

351
00:11:08,626 --> 0:11:09,986
CoreBluetooth's peripheral

352
00:11:09,986 --> 0:11:13,716
manager APIs in the background.

353
00:11:13,716 --> 0:11:15,256
IOS 13 will now require user

354
00:11:15,256 --> 0:11:17,046
consent if your application uses

355
00:11:17,296 --> 0:11:20,136
any CoreBluetooth APIs, and this

356
00:11:20,136 --> 0:11:21,556
applies to apps linked against

357
00:11:21,556 --> 0:11:22,966
older SDKs as well.

358
00:11:24,686 --> 0:11:26,276
You should provide an

359
00:11:26,416 --> 0:11:27,736
NSBluetoothAlwaysUsage

360
00:11:27,736 --> 0:11:29,006
Description purpose string in

361
00:11:29,006 --> 0:11:31,356
your Info.plist to help users

362
00:11:31,356 --> 0:11:33,336
understand what your app needs

363
00:11:33,396 --> 0:11:35,146
Bluetooth for and so they can

364
00:11:35,146 --> 0:11:36,976
make an informed choice, and

365
00:11:37,206 --> 0:11:38,946
this will be required for all

366
00:11:38,946 --> 0:11:41,156
apps linked on or after IOS 13,

367
00:11:41,416 --> 0:11:42,356
or your app will crash.

368
00:11:43,746 --> 0:11:44,926
Please refer to our talk last

369
00:11:44,926 --> 0:11:46,216
year for tips on how to write a

370
00:11:46,216 --> 0:11:49,326
great purpose string.

371
00:11:49,426 --> 0:11:50,316
Adoption is easy.

372
00:11:51,086 --> 0:11:52,886
If the user hasn't previously

373
00:11:52,886 --> 0:11:54,546
granted permission, then when

374
00:11:54,546 --> 0:11:56,236
your app instantiates a CB

375
00:11:56,236 --> 0:11:58,006
peripheral or central manager

376
00:11:58,006 --> 0:12:01,156
object, iOS will ask the user if

377
00:11:58,006 --> 0:12:01,156
object, iOS will ask the user if

378
00:12:01,156 --> 0:12:02,206
they want to allow your app to

379
00:12:02,206 --> 0:12:03,656
access Bluetooth APIs.

380
00:12:05,006 --> 0:12:06,106
And you can check the new

381
00:12:06,106 --> 0:12:07,746
authorization property on the

382
00:12:07,746 --> 0:12:09,076
central and peripheral manager

383
00:12:09,076 --> 0:12:10,646
objects for your current

384
00:12:10,646 --> 0:12:11,556
authorization state.

385
00:12:11,856 --> 0:12:14,426
For more information, please

386
00:12:14,426 --> 0:12:15,766
check out what's new in

387
00:12:15,766 --> 0:12:20,436
CoreBluetooth Friday at 3:20.

388
00:12:20,846 --> 0:12:22,016
The last user [inaudible] change

389
00:12:22,016 --> 0:12:23,606
is on macOS Catalina, where

390
00:12:24,326 --> 0:12:26,226
we're adding user consent for

391
00:12:26,226 --> 0:12:27,736
more types of functionality and

392
00:12:27,736 --> 0:12:27,986
data.

393
00:12:29,686 --> 0:12:31,206
Last year in macOS Mohave, we

394
00:12:31,206 --> 0:12:32,956
protected these resources on the

395
00:12:32,956 --> 0:12:34,796
file system and required user

396
00:12:34,796 --> 0:12:36,016
consent to access them.

397
00:12:37,266 --> 0:12:38,006
This year we're adding

398
00:12:38,006 --> 0:12:39,766
protection to the Desktop,

399
00:12:39,856 --> 0:12:41,026
Documents, and Downloads

400
00:12:41,026 --> 0:12:43,796
folders, iCloud Drive and

401
00:12:43,796 --> 0:12:45,416
Third-Party Cloud Storage as

402
00:12:45,416 --> 0:12:46,686
well as Network and Removable

403
00:12:46,686 --> 0:12:47,186
Volumes.

404
00:12:47,876 --> 0:12:50,746
In addition, the camera and

405
00:12:50,746 --> 0:12:52,106
microphone controls introduce

406
00:12:52,106 --> 0:12:54,446
macOS Mohave or infusing screen

407
00:12:54,446 --> 0:12:56,206
recording and keyboard input

408
00:12:56,206 --> 0:12:58,466
monitoring in macOS Catalina as

409
00:12:59,226 --> 0:13:00,536
well as user control over

410
00:12:59,226 --> 0:13:00,536
well as user control over

411
00:13:00,536 --> 0:13:01,936
synthetic input events and

412
00:13:01,996 --> 0:13:02,676
AppleEvents.

413
00:13:04,006 --> 0:13:05,416
For more information, check out

414
00:13:05,416 --> 0:13:07,006
advances in macOS security

415
00:13:07,006 --> 0:13:09,346
session in the WWDC app or their

416
00:13:09,346 --> 0:13:13,936
lab tomorrow at 2 p.m. Next, I

417
00:13:14,056 --> 0:13:16,636
have three new frameworks with

418
00:13:16,636 --> 0:13:17,506
new behaviors.

419
00:13:18,196 --> 0:13:21,606
First, I have some exciting news

420
00:13:21,606 --> 0:13:22,586
for web developers.

421
00:13:23,196 --> 0:13:25,476
We introduced Intelligent

422
00:13:25,716 --> 0:13:27,606
Tracking Prevention, ITP, two

423
00:13:27,606 --> 0:13:29,626
years ago, to protect against

424
00:13:29,766 --> 0:13:31,056
cross-site user tracking.

425
00:13:31,966 --> 0:13:33,886
On by default in Safari, it's

426
00:13:33,886 --> 0:13:35,816
had a big impact, and we're

427
00:13:35,816 --> 0:13:37,206
thrilled to see other browsers

428
00:13:37,206 --> 0:13:38,966
adopt similar techniques and

429
00:13:38,966 --> 0:13:40,326
build consensus against

430
00:13:40,326 --> 0:13:41,156
cross-site tracking.

431
00:13:42,966 --> 0:13:44,556
We don't, however, believe that

432
00:13:44,556 --> 0:13:46,426
a web without free of tracking

433
00:13:46,796 --> 0:13:48,406
is necessarily a web without

434
00:13:48,406 --> 0:13:49,266
advertisements.

435
00:13:50,156 --> 0:13:51,856
And last year we took a first

436
00:13:51,856 --> 0:13:53,036
step in building privacy

437
00:13:53,036 --> 0:13:54,676
friendly ad infrastructure with

438
00:13:54,676 --> 0:13:56,716
installed validation, which

439
00:13:56,716 --> 0:13:57,966
allows developers to measure

440
00:13:57,966 --> 0:13:59,896
conversions from advertisements

441
00:13:59,896 --> 0:14:01,016
to app installs.

442
00:13:59,896 --> 0:14:01,016
to app installs.

443
00:14:02,336 --> 0:14:03,606
This year, we're tackling the

444
00:14:04,366 --> 0:14:04,486
web.

445
00:14:05,136 --> 0:14:07,266
Privacy Preserving Ad Click

446
00:14:07,266 --> 0:14:09,636
Attribution is a new way for

447
00:14:09,736 --> 0:14:11,016
advertisers and merchants on the

448
00:14:11,016 --> 0:14:12,806
web to measure the success of

449
00:14:12,806 --> 0:14:14,576
their ad campaigns without

450
00:14:14,576 --> 0:14:15,966
tracking individual users.

451
00:14:16,606 --> 0:14:18,956
Let's say they sell running

452
00:14:18,956 --> 0:14:20,136
shoes on SneakerNet.

453
00:14:21,666 --> 0:14:23,866
I buy ads on search.example, and

454
00:14:24,896 --> 0:14:26,036
I want to know how effective

455
00:14:26,036 --> 0:14:27,546
those ads are at driving visits

456
00:14:27,546 --> 0:14:28,606
and purchases to my site.

457
00:14:29,036 --> 0:14:31,606
This used to be done through

458
00:14:31,606 --> 0:14:33,356
cross-site tracking, which ITP

459
00:14:33,356 --> 0:14:34,196
now blocks.

460
00:14:34,836 --> 0:14:38,226
In Privacy Preserving Ad Click

461
00:14:38,226 --> 0:14:40,436
Attribution, Safari connects

462
00:14:40,466 --> 0:14:43,946
clicks on ads with conversions

463
00:14:43,946 --> 0:14:47,666
on the merchant and reports

464
00:14:47,666 --> 0:14:48,936
these attributions to the ad

465
00:14:48,936 --> 0:14:49,536
provider.

466
00:14:50,086 --> 0:14:52,266
Let's walk through how this

467
00:14:53,676 --> 0:14:54,036
happens.

468
00:14:54,296 --> 0:14:56,256
Now when a user clicks on an ad

469
00:14:56,256 --> 0:14:57,256
on search.example for

470
00:14:57,256 --> 0:14:59,936
SneakerNet, Safari will remember

471
00:14:59,936 --> 0:15:01,126
this for seven days.

472
00:14:59,936 --> 0:15:01,126
this for seven days.

473
00:15:01,416 --> 0:15:04,736
And in that seven-day window, if

474
00:15:04,736 --> 0:15:06,026
the user makes a purchase on

475
00:15:06,026 --> 0:15:08,046
SneakerNet, the merchant or

476
00:15:08,046 --> 0:15:09,936
advertiser can identify this as

477
00:15:09,936 --> 0:15:11,986
a potential conversion, and

478
00:15:12,456 --> 0:15:13,736
Safari will connect this

479
00:15:13,806 --> 0:15:15,326
potential conversion with a

480
00:15:15,376 --> 0:15:17,136
previously stored ad clicks and

481
00:15:17,686 --> 0:15:19,796
record that conversion did occur

482
00:15:19,796 --> 0:15:22,456
from search.example to

483
00:15:24,076 --> 0:15:24,456
SneakerNet.

484
00:15:24,636 --> 0:15:25,836
Safari will then report this

485
00:15:25,836 --> 0:15:27,316
conversion as a delayed

486
00:15:27,316 --> 0:15:28,256
ephemeral post the

487
00:15:28,256 --> 0:15:29,836
search.example.

488
00:15:31,296 --> 0:15:32,526
Adoption is easy.

489
00:15:33,636 --> 0:15:34,636
The ad provider just needs to

490
00:15:34,686 --> 0:15:36,236
decorate their outgoing link

491
00:15:36,236 --> 0:15:37,806
anchor tags with two new

492
00:15:37,806 --> 0:15:40,406
attributes, adDestination, the

493
00:15:40,406 --> 0:15:41,456
site where you expect

494
00:15:41,506 --> 0:15:42,536
conversions to occur.

495
00:15:43,226 --> 0:15:46,846
Here, SneakerNet.example and the

496
00:15:46,846 --> 0:15:47,826
adCampaignID.

497
00:15:49,016 --> 0:15:50,346
Search.example might be running

498
00:15:50,346 --> 0:15:51,846
many concurrent ad campaigns for

499
00:15:51,846 --> 0:15:54,096
SneakerNet, and the CampaignID

500
00:15:54,096 --> 0:15:55,056
allows you to measure them

501
00:15:55,056 --> 0:15:55,496
separately.

502
00:15:56,046 --> 0:15:59,206
We can detect conversions

503
00:15:59,366 --> 0:16:00,656
without any change on the

504
00:15:59,366 --> 0:16:00,656
without any change on the

505
00:16:00,656 --> 0:16:02,186
merchant site by leverage

506
00:16:02,826 --> 0:16:06,016
existing tracking pixels, which

507
00:16:06,016 --> 0:16:07,306
a search provider can then

508
00:16:07,306 --> 0:16:08,716
redirect the server side to a

509
00:16:09,306 --> 0:16:11,286
well-known URL that identifies

510
00:16:11,286 --> 0:16:12,846
the ConversionID as a past

511
00:16:12,846 --> 0:16:13,266
component.

512
00:16:14,576 --> 0:16:16,306
Conversions can be anything from

513
00:16:16,466 --> 0:16:17,506
putting an item in a shopping

514
00:16:17,506 --> 0:16:19,696
cart, to creating an account, to

515
00:16:19,696 --> 0:16:21,426
making a purchase, and the

516
00:16:21,426 --> 0:16:23,036
ConversionID allows the merchant

517
00:16:23,076 --> 0:16:24,466
to distinguish between these

518
00:16:24,496 --> 0:16:26,416
different Conversion events.

519
00:16:27,836 --> 0:16:29,786
To preserve the user's privacy,

520
00:16:30,076 --> 0:16:31,956
Safari limits the Campaign and

521
00:16:31,956 --> 0:16:33,976
ConversionIDs each to 64

522
00:16:33,976 --> 0:16:34,866
possible values.

523
00:16:35,526 --> 0:16:36,966
So, each conversion between an

524
00:16:36,966 --> 0:16:39,016
advertiser and merchant can only

525
00:16:39,016 --> 0:16:40,786
be linked to 1 of 4000 possible

526
00:16:40,786 --> 0:16:40,976
values.

527
00:16:43,046 --> 0:16:45,276
Safari will wait 24 to 48 hours

528
00:16:45,566 --> 0:16:46,356
before reporting this

529
00:16:46,356 --> 0:16:48,506
attribution, both to aggregate

530
00:16:48,506 --> 0:16:49,996
multiple Clicks and Conversions

531
00:16:50,656 --> 0:16:52,076
and to prevent correlation with

532
00:16:52,076 --> 0:16:53,826
user activity on either site.

533
00:16:55,146 --> 0:16:57,036
The Conversion attribution will

534
00:16:57,036 --> 0:16:58,236
be reported in an ephemeral

535
00:16:58,236 --> 0:17:00,176
session without any cookies.

536
00:16:58,236 --> 0:17:00,176
session without any cookies.

537
00:17:01,076 --> 0:17:02,896
And Clicks and Conversions are

538
00:17:02,896 --> 0:17:04,286
not recorded in private

539
00:17:04,346 --> 0:17:04,685
browsing.

540
00:17:05,185 --> 0:17:09,016
Privacy Preserving Ad Click

541
00:17:09,016 --> 0:17:11,526
Attribution is available to try

542
00:17:11,746 --> 0:17:13,526
out in Safari Technology Preview

543
00:17:13,526 --> 0:17:13,786
83.

544
00:17:13,786 --> 0:17:16,156
It will be on by default in iOS

545
00:17:16,156 --> 0:17:18,896
13 and macOS Catalina, and we've

546
00:17:18,896 --> 0:17:20,646
submitted to W3C for

547
00:17:20,646 --> 0:17:21,996
consideration as a web standard.

548
00:17:21,996 --> 0:17:24,136
And you can see more details at

549
00:17:24,136 --> 0:17:25,705
webkit.org/blog.

550
00:17:28,726 --> 0:17:29,866
Next, I'm going to talk about

551
00:17:29,866 --> 0:17:31,276
the Speech Recognizer framework,

552
00:17:31,866 --> 0:17:33,796
which allows you to transcribe

553
00:17:33,796 --> 0:17:34,216
audio.

554
00:17:35,546 --> 0:17:36,876
We've heard many requests for a

555
00:17:36,876 --> 0:17:38,016
way to perform transcription

556
00:17:38,016 --> 0:17:39,866
locally, and this is especially

557
00:17:39,866 --> 0:17:41,156
helpful in regulated

558
00:17:41,156 --> 0:17:42,306
environments such as healthcare.

559
00:17:42,856 --> 0:17:46,116
In iOS 13, we're introducing

560
00:17:46,116 --> 0:17:47,976
offline transcription, so you

561
00:17:47,976 --> 0:17:49,736
can transcribe audio without

562
00:17:49,736 --> 0:17:51,216
internet connectivity and

563
00:17:51,216 --> 0:17:52,376
without sending potentially

564
00:17:52,376 --> 0:17:53,946
sensitive audio off device.

565
00:17:55,176 --> 0:17:57,086
To adopt, you can check

566
00:17:57,086 --> 0:17:58,726
isAvailableForLocal Recognition

567
00:17:59,026 --> 0:18:01,686
on Speech Recognizer and specify

568
00:17:59,026 --> 0:18:01,686
on Speech Recognizer and specify

569
00:18:01,686 --> 0:18:03,846
requiresLocalRecognition when

570
00:18:03,906 --> 0:18:05,336
creating a speech recognition

571
00:18:05,336 --> 0:18:05,866
request.

572
00:18:08,756 --> 0:18:10,876
Third, we have new ways for test

573
00:18:10,876 --> 0:18:12,166
users to provide feedback in

574
00:18:12,166 --> 0:18:12,616
TextFlight.

575
00:18:13,716 --> 0:18:15,026
We understand as app developers

576
00:18:15,026 --> 0:18:16,416
it's really important to

577
00:18:16,416 --> 0:18:18,356
understand exactly where users

578
00:18:18,356 --> 0:18:19,646
are running into issues in your

579
00:18:19,646 --> 0:18:21,286
app, and we want to help you

580
00:18:21,286 --> 0:18:22,936
learn from your test users while

581
00:18:22,936 --> 0:18:23,926
preserving their privacy.

582
00:18:25,596 --> 0:18:26,996
So in iOS 13, we're introducing

583
00:18:26,996 --> 0:18:28,576
the ability for TextFlight users

584
00:18:28,576 --> 0:18:30,626
to submit screen shots directly

585
00:18:30,626 --> 0:18:31,976
from the Screenshot UI through

586
00:18:32,126 --> 0:18:32,756
TextFlight.

587
00:18:34,006 --> 0:18:35,416
They can also now send feedback

588
00:18:35,726 --> 0:18:37,686
along with crash reports so you

589
00:18:37,686 --> 0:18:39,396
can understand exactly what they

590
00:18:39,396 --> 0:18:40,546
were doing at the time of the

591
00:18:40,546 --> 0:18:42,636

Store Connect in the WWDC app.

602
00:19:00,666 --> 0:19:01,446
Now, I'm going to turn it over

603
00:19:01,446 --> 0:19:02,816
to my colleague, Julien, to talk

604
00:19:02,816 --> 0:19:04,226
about privacy updates.

605
00:19:05,516 --> 0:19:08,546
[ Applause ]

606
00:19:09,046 --> 0:19:09,676
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Mark.

607
00:19:11,516 --> 0:19:13,756
In this next section, let's talk

608
00:19:13,756 --> 0:19:15,596
about privacy updates to

609
00:19:15,596 --> 0:19:16,626
existing APIs.

610
00:19:18,376 --> 0:19:19,956
We go through a series of five

611
00:19:20,146 --> 0:19:22,086
updates in rapid fashion.

612
00:19:22,686 --> 0:19:25,916
First, CNCopyCurrentNetworkInfo.

613
00:19:26,886 --> 0:19:29,126
The CNCopyCurrentNetworkInfo API

614
00:19:29,676 --> 0:19:31,936
returns the name and Mac address

615
00:19:32,236 --> 0:19:34,026
of the Wi-Fi access point a

616
00:19:34,026 --> 0:19:35,996
device is currently connected

617
00:19:36,046 --> 0:19:36,206
to.

618
00:19:37,166 --> 0:19:40,176
This affects privacy as a Wi-Fi

619
00:19:40,176 --> 0:19:42,616
access point reveals a user's

620
00:19:42,616 --> 0:19:43,006
location.

621
00:19:44,606 --> 0:19:48,056
Starting in iOS 13, CNCopy will

622
00:19:48,056 --> 0:19:50,856
only work for certain categories

623
00:19:50,856 --> 0:19:53,726
of apps, apps that declared the

624
00:19:53,866 --> 0:19:57,196
CNCopy entitlement and apps that

625
00:19:57,646 --> 0:20:00,006
configured a virtual private

626
00:19:57,646 --> 0:20:00,006
configured a virtual private

627
00:20:00,056 --> 0:20:00,436
network.

628
00:20:01,206 --> 0:20:03,536
Or apps that configured a Wi-Fi

629
00:20:03,536 --> 0:20:04,516
network using the

630
00:20:04,516 --> 0:20:07,886
NEHotspotConfiguration API or

631
00:20:07,886 --> 0:20:09,916
apps that obtain location

632
00:20:09,916 --> 0:20:11,466
permission from the user.

633
00:20:12,596 --> 0:20:14,016
What this means for you is that

634
00:20:14,016 --> 0:20:15,876
you may not be able to access

635
00:20:15,976 --> 0:20:17,266
CNCopy anymore.

636
00:20:18,506 --> 0:20:20,036
You can find out more details

637
00:20:20,156 --> 0:20:21,526
about this in the networking

638
00:20:21,526 --> 0:20:22,726
sessions listed below.

639
00:20:24,306 --> 0:20:26,626
Second, contacts access.

640
00:20:27,306 --> 0:20:30,376
Starting in iOS 13, apps that

641
00:20:30,376 --> 0:20:32,216
have been authorized by a user

642
00:20:32,406 --> 0:20:34,546
to access contacts will no

643
00:20:34,546 --> 0:20:36,706
longer have access to the notes

644
00:20:36,706 --> 0:20:37,916
field of a contact.

645
00:20:38,856 --> 0:20:40,966
The notes field of a contact

646
00:20:41,226 --> 0:20:43,316
potentially includes sensitive

647
00:20:43,316 --> 0:20:45,476
details such as sneaky comments

648
00:20:45,536 --> 0:20:46,376
about your boss.

649
00:20:47,316 --> 0:20:49,046
Most apps do not need access to

650
00:20:49,046 --> 0:20:49,466
this data.

651
00:20:50,156 --> 0:20:52,096
If you believe you need access

652
00:20:52,186 --> 0:20:53,816
to it, please file an

653
00:20:53,816 --> 0:20:55,216
entitlement request at the

654
00:20:55,216 --> 0:20:56,306
following URL.

655
00:20:57,096 --> 0:21:00,086
Third, Custom URL Schemes.

656
00:20:57,096 --> 0:21:00,086
Third, Custom URL Schemes.

657
00:21:00,926 --> 0:21:03,156
Previously, if your app was

658
00:21:03,156 --> 0:21:05,556
launched by a Custom URL Scheme,

659
00:21:06,176 --> 0:21:08,356
you could identify the app that

660
00:21:08,356 --> 0:21:10,586
launched you via an option of

661
00:21:10,626 --> 0:21:11,586
open URL.

662
00:21:12,716 --> 0:21:14,556
This revealed applications

663
00:21:14,646 --> 0:21:16,256
installed on a user's device.

664
00:21:17,106 --> 0:21:20,016
Starting in iOS 13, the source

665
00:21:20,016 --> 0:21:22,466
application is only revealed to

666
00:21:22,466 --> 0:21:24,276
apps from the same developer.

667
00:21:25,146 --> 0:21:27,446
Fourth, Game Center.

668
00:21:28,426 --> 0:21:30,336
In order to improve player

669
00:21:30,456 --> 0:21:33,696
privacy, Game Center introduces

670
00:21:33,936 --> 0:21:36,656
two new APIs.

671
00:21:36,706 --> 0:21:38,606
The teamPlayerID for a

672
00:21:38,706 --> 0:21:40,626
team-scoped player identifier

673
00:21:40,936 --> 0:21:42,336
and the gamePlayerID for a

674
00:21:42,396 --> 0:21:44,266
game-scoped player identifier.

675
00:21:45,096 --> 0:21:47,146
The existing playerID identifier

676
00:21:47,516 --> 0:21:48,606
is being deprecated.

677
00:21:49,656 --> 0:21:51,836
This changes which identifier

678
00:21:52,136 --> 0:21:53,516
you may use in your gaming app.

679
00:21:54,256 --> 0:21:56,096
For more information, please

680
00:21:56,096 --> 0:21:57,746
check out the Game Center video

681
00:21:57,946 --> 0:21:59,726
in the WWDC app.

682
00:22:00,096 --> 0:22:01,986
And five, contextual

683
00:22:02,046 --> 0:22:02,956
information.

684
00:22:04,036 --> 0:22:06,586
IOS doesn't know when your app

685
00:22:06,586 --> 0:22:08,616
is most helpful to users.

686
00:22:09,656 --> 0:22:11,646
You can provide contextual

687
00:22:11,646 --> 0:22:13,986
information, entry point into

688
00:22:13,986 --> 0:22:17,546
your app via two main APIs,

689
00:22:17,546 --> 0:22:19,966
NSUserActivity, to promote your

690
00:22:20,186 --> 0:22:23,156
app in Search results, and

691
00:22:23,226 --> 0:22:25,236
SiriKit INInteraction to promote

692
00:22:25,236 --> 0:22:26,686
your app on on-device

693
00:22:26,766 --> 0:22:28,456
intelligent scenarios such as

694
00:22:28,726 --> 0:22:31,516
Maps Shortcuts and new this year

695
00:22:31,516 --> 0:22:32,206
in the Share Sheet.

696
00:22:32,866 --> 0:22:35,356
If you do promote your app, be a

697
00:22:35,356 --> 0:22:35,916
good sport.

698
00:22:36,676 --> 0:22:38,336
Delete content that was removed

699
00:22:38,336 --> 0:22:38,826
from your app.

700
00:22:39,906 --> 0:22:41,606
You don't want Siri Shortcuts to

701
00:22:41,606 --> 0:22:43,336
make a suggestion to content

702
00:22:43,486 --> 0:22:44,676
that does not exist anymore.

703
00:22:45,386 --> 0:22:47,246
Simply call the corresponding

704
00:22:47,406 --> 0:22:49,516
deletion APIs.

705
00:22:49,516 --> 0:22:50,616
We just went through a series a

706
00:22:50,616 --> 0:22:53,146
five privacy updates to existing

707
00:22:53,146 --> 0:22:53,426
APIs.

708
00:22:54,236 --> 0:22:56,436
In our next section, we take a

709
00:22:56,436 --> 0:22:57,836
step back.

710
00:22:58,156 --> 0:23:00,746
We discuss how a privacy

711
00:22:58,156 --> 0:23:00,746
We discuss how a privacy

712
00:23:00,786 --> 0:23:03,476
challenge can be a chance to

713
00:23:03,626 --> 0:23:04,066
innovate.

714
00:23:05,036 --> 0:23:07,226
Privacy is fundamental to the

715
00:23:07,226 --> 0:23:08,766
design of every product.

716
00:23:09,186 --> 0:23:11,126
At Apple, in the Privacy Team,

717
00:23:11,356 --> 0:23:12,866
we work with engineers all

718
00:23:12,866 --> 0:23:15,266
across Apple to build privacy

719
00:23:15,266 --> 0:23:16,336
into our products.

720
00:23:17,926 --> 0:23:20,666
Once in a while, we hit a very

721
00:23:20,666 --> 0:23:23,546
hard problem, a feature that we

722
00:23:23,546 --> 0:23:25,406
really want to ship, but it's

723
00:23:25,406 --> 0:23:27,276
not obvious how to protect

724
00:23:27,556 --> 0:23:28,076
privacy.

725
00:23:29,636 --> 0:23:31,676
So when that happens, we decide

726
00:23:31,676 --> 0:23:32,836
to challenge ourselves.

727
00:23:33,236 --> 0:23:35,006
We aim to build a great feature

728
00:23:35,226 --> 0:23:36,756
without giving away user

729
00:23:36,756 --> 0:23:38,926
information, so we lean on our

730
00:23:38,926 --> 0:23:41,646
privacy principles to find

731
00:23:41,646 --> 0:23:43,406
solutions and innovate.

732
00:23:44,686 --> 0:23:46,786
Today, we want to inspire you to

733
00:23:46,786 --> 0:23:47,306
do the same.

734
00:23:48,286 --> 0:23:49,686
Let's look at three critical

735
00:23:49,686 --> 0:23:51,346
areas of the user experience,

736
00:23:52,016 --> 0:23:54,676
Machine Learning, Find My, and

737
00:23:54,676 --> 0:23:54,896
Home.

738
00:23:56,026 --> 0:23:57,366
Let's start with Machine

739
00:23:57,366 --> 0:23:57,616
Learning.

740
00:23:58,436 --> 0:24:00,196
There are many ways to build

741
00:23:58,436 --> 0:24:00,196
There are many ways to build

742
00:24:00,406 --> 0:24:01,726
Machine Learning applications.

743
00:24:02,446 --> 0:24:04,656
Usually we need to train a model

744
00:24:05,096 --> 0:24:06,326
and then evaluate it.

745
00:24:06,986 --> 0:24:09,006
So the first privacy challenge

746
00:24:09,246 --> 0:24:11,436
with Machine Learning is how to

747
00:24:11,436 --> 0:24:13,536
train a machine learning model

748
00:24:14,216 --> 0:24:16,086
but without collecting sensitive

749
00:24:16,216 --> 0:24:18,886
user data while personalizing

750
00:24:18,886 --> 0:24:21,396
the model to every user and

751
00:24:22,076 --> 0:24:24,066
significantly improving the user

752
00:24:24,066 --> 0:24:24,516
experience.

753
00:24:25,186 --> 0:24:27,106
And again, it usually starts

754
00:24:27,176 --> 0:24:29,606
with data, and it's usually a

755
00:24:29,606 --> 0:24:30,616
lot of data.

756
00:24:31,946 --> 0:24:33,326
And it can be challenging to

757
00:24:33,326 --> 0:24:33,866
find data.

758
00:24:33,866 --> 0:24:35,686
There are multiple options.

759
00:24:36,456 --> 0:24:38,556
The first option is to collect

760
00:24:38,556 --> 0:24:39,426
data from users.

761
00:24:40,406 --> 0:24:42,686
So to protect user privacy, it's

762
00:24:42,686 --> 0:24:44,796
important to apply best privacy

763
00:24:44,906 --> 0:24:46,956
practices such as randomizing

764
00:24:46,956 --> 0:24:48,826
identifiers, rounding or

765
00:24:48,826 --> 0:24:49,456
sampling.

766
00:24:50,416 --> 0:24:53,466
But sometimes data is inherently

767
00:24:53,586 --> 0:24:55,866
sensitive, like the picture of

768
00:24:55,866 --> 0:24:56,626
user's face.

769
00:24:56,886 --> 0:24:59,286
A second option is to run a user

770
00:24:59,286 --> 0:24:59,656
study.

771
00:25:01,116 --> 0:25:03,826
We invite select users to test

772
00:25:03,826 --> 0:25:05,606
or feature in private and

773
00:25:05,606 --> 0:25:06,546
collect their data.

774
00:25:07,516 --> 0:25:09,456
We did this ourselves to train

775
00:25:09,656 --> 0:25:10,226
Face ID.

776
00:25:11,306 --> 0:25:13,286
Finally, their external

777
00:25:13,286 --> 0:25:13,956
datasets.

778
00:25:14,786 --> 0:25:16,286
Some are publicly available for

779
00:25:16,286 --> 0:25:17,246
research purposes.

780
00:25:17,746 --> 0:25:19,416
Others require careful

781
00:25:19,446 --> 0:25:21,186
collaboration with other

782
00:25:21,186 --> 0:25:23,766
companies and raise their own

783
00:25:23,976 --> 0:25:24,896
privacy challenges.

784
00:25:26,046 --> 0:25:28,696
Once you have data, you can

785
00:25:28,696 --> 0:25:29,306
train a model.

786
00:25:30,316 --> 0:25:32,186
You can, for example, use Create

787
00:25:32,186 --> 0:25:32,306
ML.

788
00:25:33,066 --> 0:25:35,416
A train model is great for most

789
00:25:35,416 --> 0:25:37,926
users, but users are different,

790
00:25:38,736 --> 0:25:39,976
each with their own needs.

791
00:25:41,186 --> 0:25:43,166
What if you needed to tailor, to

792
00:25:43,286 --> 0:25:45,546
personalize a model to specific

793
00:25:45,816 --> 0:25:46,336
users?

794
00:25:47,416 --> 0:25:49,086
This year, we introduce

795
00:25:49,086 --> 0:25:51,316
updatable Core ML models.

796
00:25:51,836 --> 0:25:53,876
Send your updatable model to the

797
00:25:53,876 --> 0:25:54,236
device.

798
00:25:55,116 --> 0:25:57,316
An updatable model takes in

799
00:25:57,316 --> 0:25:59,126
training data from the user and

800
00:25:59,126 --> 0:26:01,296
produces a new personalized

801
00:25:59,126 --> 0:26:01,296
produces a new personalized

802
00:26:01,626 --> 0:26:01,936
model.

803
00:26:02,826 --> 0:26:04,376
We do this ourselves with Face

804
00:26:04,406 --> 0:26:04,786
ID.

805
00:26:05,276 --> 0:26:07,436
Face ID automatically adjusts to

806
00:26:07,436 --> 0:26:08,006
your appearance.

807
00:26:08,806 --> 0:26:10,906
If you grow a beard or grow

808
00:26:10,906 --> 0:26:13,146
longer hair, Face ID still

809
00:26:13,146 --> 0:26:13,876
recognizes you.

810
00:26:14,026 --> 0:26:15,876
And this all happens on the

811
00:26:15,876 --> 0:26:16,146
device.

812
00:26:17,746 --> 0:26:19,976
Training uses resources though,

813
00:26:20,526 --> 0:26:22,656
and it may affect a user

814
00:26:23,326 --> 0:26:24,056
experience.

815
00:26:24,206 --> 0:26:25,366
While there's a new Background

816
00:26:25,366 --> 0:26:27,606
Task API that allows you to

817
00:26:27,606 --> 0:26:29,536
schedule machine learning tasks

818
00:26:29,886 --> 0:26:32,406
in the background, we recommend

819
00:26:32,856 --> 0:26:34,746
scheduling a task within a week

820
00:26:34,746 --> 0:26:35,096
or less.

821
00:26:36,356 --> 0:26:38,526
If you choose a date too far

822
00:26:38,526 --> 0:26:40,876
into the future, iOS may not

823
00:26:40,916 --> 0:26:42,266
schedule it.

824
00:26:42,586 --> 0:26:43,706
You can learn more about the

825
00:26:43,706 --> 0:26:45,276
Background Task API in our

826
00:26:45,276 --> 0:26:45,906
session below.

827
00:26:46,686 --> 0:26:50,126
But sometimes, we need more than

828
00:26:50,126 --> 0:26:51,016
one user's data.

829
00:26:51,896 --> 0:26:54,026
We need data from many different

830
00:26:54,026 --> 0:26:54,586
users.

831
00:26:55,576 --> 0:26:57,676
Today, I want to share with you

832
00:26:58,676 --> 0:27:00,296
a new technique that we are

833
00:26:58,676 --> 0:27:00,296
a new technique that we are

834
00:27:00,296 --> 0:27:00,876
developing.

835
00:27:02,066 --> 0:27:03,726
This is an example of how we

836
00:27:03,726 --> 0:27:06,386
innovate in privacy for machine

837
00:27:06,386 --> 0:27:06,626
learning.

838
00:27:07,656 --> 0:27:09,906
Federated Learning is a new

839
00:27:09,906 --> 0:27:11,236
approach that is picking up

840
00:27:11,236 --> 0:27:12,596
steam in the machine learning

841
00:27:12,596 --> 0:27:13,096
community.

842
00:27:13,736 --> 0:27:15,806
Today, we're introducing Private

843
00:27:16,126 --> 0:27:18,136
Federated Learning by combining

844
00:27:18,316 --> 0:27:19,816
Federated Learning with

845
00:27:19,816 --> 0:27:21,016
differential privacy.

846
00:27:21,736 --> 0:27:25,406
The idea is simple, instead of

847
00:27:25,446 --> 0:27:27,826
collecting user data with

848
00:27:27,826 --> 0:27:30,066
Private Federated Learning, we

849
00:27:30,066 --> 0:27:31,986
collect model updates.

850
00:27:32,666 --> 0:27:35,636
In other words, devices tell the

851
00:27:35,636 --> 0:27:38,006
server how a machine learning

852
00:27:38,006 --> 0:27:40,166
model should be updated.

853
00:27:41,236 --> 0:27:42,786
Let's walk through an example.

854
00:27:43,726 --> 0:27:46,336
It all starts with the server

855
00:27:46,436 --> 0:27:48,136
giving devices an original

856
00:27:48,226 --> 0:27:48,556
model.

857
00:27:49,476 --> 0:27:50,506
We show it in white here.

858
00:27:51,326 --> 0:27:53,376
Each device trains the model

859
00:27:53,446 --> 0:27:55,846
under local data and obtains a

860
00:27:55,846 --> 0:27:56,326
new model.

861
00:27:57,436 --> 0:27:58,976
We show it here by changing the

862
00:27:58,976 --> 0:27:59,266
color.

863
00:27:59,696 --> 0:28:00,986
They compute the difference

864
00:27:59,696 --> 0:28:00,986
They compute the difference

865
00:28:01,136 --> 0:28:02,996
between this new model and the

866
00:28:02,996 --> 0:28:04,836
original one and send these

867
00:28:04,836 --> 0:28:06,846
model updates back to Apple

868
00:28:06,846 --> 0:28:07,396
servers.

869
00:28:09,466 --> 0:28:11,076
The server aggregates these

870
00:28:11,076 --> 0:28:13,046
model updates into a new

871
00:28:13,046 --> 0:28:15,216
enhanced machine learning model

872
00:28:15,626 --> 0:28:16,506
that we show here with a

873
00:28:16,506 --> 0:28:17,336
gradient color.

874
00:28:18,466 --> 0:28:20,826
Note that in this process no

875
00:28:20,826 --> 0:28:23,276
user data is sent in plain, and

876
00:28:23,276 --> 0:28:24,856
we have no needs for any user or

877
00:28:24,856 --> 0:28:26,056
device identifiers.

878
00:28:27,356 --> 0:28:28,976
The server then updates the

879
00:28:28,976 --> 0:28:30,686
devices back with a new model,

880
00:28:31,266 --> 0:28:33,386
and this cycle can go back and

881
00:28:33,466 --> 0:28:35,256
forth between the devices and

882
00:28:35,256 --> 0:28:35,656
the server.

883
00:28:36,416 --> 0:28:38,646
From a privacy perspective, we

884
00:28:38,646 --> 0:28:40,206
need to analyze whether those

885
00:28:40,206 --> 0:28:42,686
model updates include sensitive

886
00:28:42,916 --> 0:28:43,176
data.

887
00:28:44,106 --> 0:28:46,056
It's often considered that model

888
00:28:46,056 --> 0:28:46,986
updates are fine.

889
00:28:47,216 --> 0:28:48,566
They're not plain user data.

890
00:28:49,576 --> 0:28:52,016
But unfortunately, in some

891
00:28:52,076 --> 0:28:54,846
corner cases, a curious server

892
00:28:55,446 --> 0:28:57,866
could attempt to reconstruct the

893
00:28:57,866 --> 0:28:59,806
user data from model updates.

894
00:29:00,526 --> 0:29:02,686
For example, here, if a user

895
00:29:02,686 --> 0:29:04,766
sent model updates relative to

896
00:29:04,766 --> 0:29:07,446
this castle, a curious server

897
00:29:07,446 --> 0:29:09,926
may be able to reconstruct the

898
00:29:09,986 --> 0:29:11,776
castle image from the model

899
00:29:11,776 --> 0:29:12,046
update.

900
00:29:12,736 --> 0:29:15,136
So, to prevent this, we protect

901
00:29:15,376 --> 0:29:18,236
model updates using on device

902
00:29:18,366 --> 0:29:20,356
and on the server Separated

903
00:29:20,686 --> 0:29:23,026
Differential Privacy and Central

904
00:29:23,506 --> 0:29:24,766
Differential Privacy.

905
00:29:25,886 --> 0:29:28,246
Differential Privacy adds noise

906
00:29:28,556 --> 0:29:29,546
to the model updates.

907
00:29:30,186 --> 0:29:32,186
This ensures that a curious

908
00:29:32,186 --> 0:29:35,086
server cannot reconstruct the

909
00:29:35,086 --> 0:29:35,676
image anymore.

910
00:29:36,496 --> 0:29:38,946
You can find more details about

911
00:29:38,976 --> 0:29:40,586
how we use Separated

912
00:29:40,586 --> 0:29:42,016
Differential Privacy in the

913
00:29:42,086 --> 0:29:44,796
paper below that we wrote.

914
00:29:45,066 --> 0:29:47,146
Private Federated Learning can

915
00:29:47,146 --> 0:29:49,156
be used to improve on-device

916
00:29:49,296 --> 0:29:49,966
intelligence.

917
00:29:50,806 --> 0:29:52,246
This is not a research

918
00:29:52,246 --> 0:29:52,796
experiment.

919
00:29:53,536 --> 0:29:54,666
We are starting to use this

920
00:29:54,696 --> 0:29:56,596
technology in iOS 13 in a

921
00:29:56,596 --> 0:29:58,706
variety of use cases including

922
00:29:58,706 --> 0:30:00,646
QuickType keyboard, personalized

923
00:29:58,706 --> 0:30:00,646
QuickType keyboard, personalized

924
00:30:00,646 --> 0:30:02,126
Hey Siri, and more in the

925
00:30:02,176 --> 0:30:02,496
future.

926
00:30:05,036 --> 0:30:07,266
Once you train a model, you want

927
00:30:07,266 --> 0:30:07,666
to use it.

928
00:30:08,346 --> 0:30:10,606
This raises the second privacy

929
00:30:10,606 --> 0:30:11,986
challenge with machine learning.

930
00:30:13,276 --> 0:30:15,616
How to evaluate a model without

931
00:30:15,866 --> 0:30:18,156
collecting user data in a fast

932
00:30:18,156 --> 0:30:20,166
way and without suffering from

933
00:30:20,166 --> 0:30:21,406
Internet connection delays.

934
00:30:21,406 --> 0:30:24,546
The first way that comes to mind

935
00:30:24,856 --> 0:30:26,576
is to simply send user data to

936
00:30:26,676 --> 0:30:28,166
the server, evaluate the model

937
00:30:28,166 --> 0:30:29,376
there, and get back the

938
00:30:29,376 --> 0:30:30,046
inference.

939
00:30:30,866 --> 0:30:32,616
But this means sending more user

940
00:30:32,616 --> 0:30:33,536
data to the server.

941
00:30:33,876 --> 0:30:36,236
Instead, we prefer on-device

942
00:30:36,236 --> 0:30:36,896
intelligence.

943
00:30:37,406 --> 0:30:38,706
We send a model down to the

944
00:30:38,706 --> 0:30:39,216
device.

945
00:30:39,666 --> 0:30:41,286
The device evaluates it locally.

946
00:30:42,166 --> 0:30:43,586
This has a lot of advantages.

947
00:30:44,276 --> 0:30:45,376
It's less data sent to the

948
00:30:45,446 --> 0:30:46,016
servers.

949
00:30:46,546 --> 0:30:47,966
It works even if you don't have

950
00:30:47,966 --> 0:30:49,696
Internet, and it's fast if you

951
00:30:49,776 --> 0:30:51,186
use Core ML.

952
00:30:51,496 --> 0:30:54,546
Core ML is optimized to run fast

953
00:30:54,826 --> 0:30:56,986
on iOS devices and others.

954
00:30:57,166 --> 0:30:59,246
It's easy to convert your

955
00:30:59,246 --> 0:31:01,286
existing model to a Core ML

956
00:30:59,246 --> 0:31:01,286
existing model to a Core ML

957
00:31:01,466 --> 0:31:04,396
model, and this year, we expand

958
00:31:04,566 --> 0:31:05,316
the number of model

959
00:31:05,316 --> 0:31:07,046
architectures that are

960
00:31:07,046 --> 0:31:07,686
supported.

961
00:31:08,446 --> 0:31:09,886
You can learn more in the Core

962
00:31:09,886 --> 0:31:13,016
ML session listed below.

963
00:31:13,366 --> 0:31:15,496
On-device intelligence provides

964
00:31:15,756 --> 0:31:19,506
strong privacy advantages, and

965
00:31:19,506 --> 0:31:21,386
we like to communicate those

966
00:31:21,386 --> 0:31:23,256
advantages to our users in the

967
00:31:23,376 --> 0:31:25,986
form of privacy assurances.

968
00:31:26,626 --> 0:31:29,376
A privacy assurance is a simple

969
00:31:29,446 --> 0:31:31,696
privacy sentence that we share

970
00:31:31,936 --> 0:31:32,696
with our users.

971
00:31:33,336 --> 0:31:34,896
This is not a privacy policy

972
00:31:34,896 --> 0:31:35,556
with legalese.

973
00:31:36,116 --> 0:31:38,596
For example, with Face ID, we

974
00:31:38,596 --> 0:31:41,726
say, Face ID data never leaves

975
00:31:41,776 --> 0:31:42,296
the device.

976
00:31:43,476 --> 0:31:44,816
This is a clear and strong

977
00:31:44,816 --> 0:31:47,066
statement about our approach to

978
00:31:47,066 --> 0:31:48,526
privacy with Face ID.

979
00:31:48,926 --> 0:31:51,696
It's easy for all users to

980
00:31:52,376 --> 0:31:53,036
understand.

981
00:31:53,036 --> 0:31:54,916
All right, this was machine

982
00:31:54,916 --> 0:31:55,246
learning.

983
00:31:56,396 --> 0:31:59,206
Let's talk about Find My next.

984
00:31:59,796 --> 0:32:01,396
This year we announced a new

985
00:31:59,796 --> 0:32:01,396
This year we announced a new

986
00:32:01,506 --> 0:32:03,426
Find My application that merges

987
00:32:03,576 --> 0:32:05,806
the Find My Friends and the Find

988
00:32:05,916 --> 0:32:07,706
My iPhone apps.

989
00:32:07,796 --> 0:32:09,666
One feature that we were very

990
00:32:09,666 --> 0:32:11,876
excited about is the offline

991
00:32:11,876 --> 0:32:12,696
finding feature.

992
00:32:13,476 --> 0:32:14,936
Here's a challenge that was

993
00:32:14,936 --> 0:32:16,096
brought to our attention.

994
00:32:16,696 --> 0:32:19,636
A user forgot their MacBook at

995
00:32:19,636 --> 0:32:20,476
the public library.

996
00:32:21,896 --> 0:32:24,176
The user realizes that, launches

997
00:32:24,176 --> 0:32:26,036
the new Find My app and attempts

998
00:32:26,036 --> 0:32:28,756
to find the MacBook, but it may

999
00:32:28,756 --> 0:32:30,726
not work because the MacBook is

1000
00:32:30,726 --> 0:32:33,736
not connected to the Internet.

1001
00:32:33,736 --> 0:32:35,186
So the privacy challenge is

1002
00:32:35,956 --> 0:32:38,356
support finding devices between

1003
00:32:38,356 --> 0:32:41,266
Mac and iPhone or a Watch that

1004
00:32:41,266 --> 0:32:43,316
is, even when it's not connected

1005
00:32:43,526 --> 0:32:44,656
to the Internet when it's

1006
00:32:44,696 --> 0:32:47,266
offline while protecting the

1007
00:32:47,296 --> 0:32:50,256
privacy of the lost devices but

1008
00:32:50,256 --> 0:32:52,266
also of anyone that would help

1009
00:32:52,266 --> 0:32:54,166
you find those lost devices and

1010
00:32:54,166 --> 0:32:56,106
making sure that Apple doesn't

1011
00:32:56,106 --> 0:32:58,166
learn anything in the process.

1012
00:32:59,126 --> 0:33:01,036
And, of course, with limited

1013
00:32:59,126 --> 0:33:01,036
And, of course, with limited

1014
00:33:01,036 --> 0:33:02,066
impact on the battery life.

1015
00:33:02,986 --> 0:33:04,056
This was a long list of

1016
00:33:04,056 --> 0:33:05,936
challenges, and so the idea for

1017
00:33:05,936 --> 0:33:07,336
us was to rely on crowd

1018
00:33:07,336 --> 0:33:07,846
sourcing.

1019
00:33:08,756 --> 0:33:10,846
We wanted to make it easy to

1020
00:33:10,846 --> 0:33:12,826
detect a lost MacBook via

1021
00:33:12,826 --> 0:33:14,746
Bluetooth and report its

1022
00:33:14,746 --> 0:33:16,096
location to Apple servers.

1023
00:33:16,746 --> 0:33:18,706
But we couldn't rely on a static

1024
00:33:18,706 --> 0:33:20,126
identifier broadcast over

1025
00:33:20,126 --> 0:33:20,536
Bluetooth.

1026
00:33:21,226 --> 0:33:23,276
A static identifier could allow

1027
00:33:23,626 --> 0:33:25,856
anyone to track any device at

1028
00:33:25,856 --> 0:33:27,856
any time, and we couldn't do

1029
00:33:28,976 --> 0:33:29,106
that.

1030
00:33:29,336 --> 0:33:32,426
Instead, the MacBook broadcasts

1031
00:33:32,756 --> 0:33:35,146
and ephemeral public encryption

1032
00:33:35,146 --> 0:33:35,316
key.

1033
00:33:36,526 --> 0:33:39,106
This key changes over time.

1034
00:33:40,106 --> 0:33:43,036
Any nearby phone can receive

1035
00:33:43,036 --> 0:33:44,646
over Bluetooth this encryption

1036
00:33:44,646 --> 0:33:46,796
key, compute their own location,

1037
00:33:47,056 --> 0:33:48,446
and encrypt it with the

1038
00:33:48,446 --> 0:33:49,126
encryption key.

1039
00:33:50,326 --> 0:33:52,116
Then, this encrypted data can be

1040
00:33:52,116 --> 0:33:53,626
submitted to Apple servers.

1041
00:33:54,476 --> 0:33:56,766
Note here that since location is

1042
00:33:56,766 --> 0:33:59,356
encrypted, Apple cannot see it.

1043
00:33:59,556 --> 0:34:01,266
Also, note that no information

1044
00:33:59,556 --> 0:34:01,266
Also, note that no information

1045
00:34:01,266 --> 0:34:02,506
is provided about the nearby

1046
00:34:02,506 --> 0:34:04,036
phone that helped find the lost

1047
00:34:04,036 --> 0:34:04,506
device.

1048
00:34:05,186 --> 0:34:07,916
Finally, the owner can ask Apple

1049
00:34:07,916 --> 0:34:09,716
later on for the corresponding

1050
00:34:09,716 --> 0:34:11,996
encrypted data, decrypt it to

1051
00:34:11,996 --> 0:34:14,085
obtain the location to its lost

1052
00:34:14,166 --> 0:34:14,716
device.

1053
00:34:15,505 --> 0:34:17,666
With this proposal, we can share

1054
00:34:17,926 --> 0:34:19,806
the following privacy assurance

1055
00:34:20,016 --> 0:34:20,766
with our users.

1056
00:34:21,735 --> 0:34:24,565
Apple does not know the location

1057
00:34:24,565 --> 0:34:26,775
of any offline devices or

1058
00:34:26,775 --> 0:34:27,576
finders.

1059
00:34:28,426 --> 0:34:29,706
This is a big result.

1060
00:34:30,085 --> 0:34:31,706
We found a way to design a

1061
00:34:31,706 --> 0:34:34,186
fantastic feature with industry

1062
00:34:34,295 --> 0:34:35,446
leading privacy.

1063
00:34:36,045 --> 0:34:41,156
Next, let's talk about the Home.

1064
00:34:42,315 --> 0:34:44,616
The Home is a safe place, and

1065
00:34:44,616 --> 0:34:45,976
important place for all of us.

1066
00:34:46,656 --> 0:34:48,416
It's a safe place we go to after

1067
00:34:48,416 --> 0:34:50,085
work or after a long day at

1068
00:34:50,085 --> 0:34:52,856
WWDC, and as the popularity of

1069
00:34:52,926 --> 0:34:55,746
Smart homes increases, so does

1070
00:34:56,045 --> 0:34:57,836
new privacy threats emerge.

1071
00:34:58,796 --> 0:35:00,846
Many customers have concerns

1072
00:34:58,796 --> 0:35:00,846
Many customers have concerns

1073
00:35:00,996 --> 0:35:02,526
about Smart home accessories,

1074
00:35:02,906 --> 0:35:04,996
and nothing is more sensitive

1075
00:35:05,406 --> 0:35:07,456
than security cameras in the

1076
00:35:07,456 --> 0:35:07,656
home.

1077
00:35:08,786 --> 0:35:10,446
So the privacy challenge here is

1078
00:35:10,706 --> 0:35:12,856
allowing users to view their

1079
00:35:12,856 --> 0:35:15,356
security cameras from anywhere

1080
00:35:16,146 --> 0:35:18,216
while allowing no one else to

1081
00:35:18,216 --> 0:35:20,696
access the video feed, not even

1082
00:35:20,766 --> 0:35:23,416
Apple, and still enabling Smart

1083
00:35:23,746 --> 0:35:25,006
camera experiences.

1084
00:35:26,086 --> 0:35:27,266
So we worked with camera

1085
00:35:27,266 --> 0:35:29,206
providers on two main things.

1086
00:35:29,676 --> 0:35:32,466
First, we rely on on-device

1087
00:35:32,546 --> 0:35:34,366
intelligence to do computer

1088
00:35:34,366 --> 0:35:36,636
vision in the home on the home

1089
00:35:36,856 --> 0:35:38,206
resident device.

1090
00:35:38,936 --> 0:35:41,596
Be it a HomePod, an Apple TV, or

1091
00:35:41,596 --> 0:35:44,576
an iPad, we detect people and

1092
00:35:44,726 --> 0:35:46,736
objects directly in the home,

1093
00:35:47,356 --> 0:35:48,296
not in the Cloud.

1094
00:35:49,456 --> 0:35:51,596
Second, we store camera

1095
00:35:51,596 --> 0:35:53,256
recordings in an end-to-end

1096
00:35:53,256 --> 0:35:54,046
encrypted manner.

1097
00:35:55,196 --> 0:35:57,776
This means only you can see the

1098
00:35:57,816 --> 0:36:00,276
content from your camera, and we

1099
00:35:57,816 --> 0:36:00,276
content from your camera, and we

1100
00:36:00,276 --> 0:36:01,626
can make the following privacy

1101
00:36:01,626 --> 0:36:02,176
assurance.

1102
00:36:03,076 --> 0:36:05,536
Only you can see the video from

1103
00:36:05,536 --> 0:36:06,236
your camera.

1104
00:36:07,056 --> 0:36:08,306
Short and sweet.

1105
00:36:09,206 --> 0:36:11,016
It's time to wrap up the privacy

1106
00:36:11,016 --> 0:36:11,426
session.

1107
00:36:12,126 --> 0:36:13,766
We talked about three privacy

1108
00:36:13,766 --> 0:36:15,626
challenges and showed you how we

1109
00:36:15,626 --> 0:36:16,176
solved them.

1110
00:36:16,866 --> 0:36:18,886
Throughout this presentation, we

1111
00:36:18,886 --> 0:36:21,166
also talked about API updates

1112
00:36:21,166 --> 0:36:22,456
and new features that we

1113
00:36:22,456 --> 0:36:25,416
designed with privacy.

1114
00:36:25,416 --> 0:36:28,146
Every year, every release, with

1115
00:36:28,146 --> 0:36:30,776
every product we challenge

1116
00:36:30,776 --> 0:36:32,786
ourselves to build great

1117
00:36:32,886 --> 0:36:35,216
features without giving away

1118
00:36:35,466 --> 0:36:36,216
user information.

1119
00:36:37,266 --> 0:36:39,326
Because privacy is fundamental

1120
00:36:39,326 --> 0:36:40,996
to the design of every product,

1121
00:36:41,776 --> 0:36:44,296
we share privacy assurances with

1122
00:36:44,296 --> 0:36:44,846
our users.

1123
00:36:45,786 --> 0:36:48,376
Simple sentences about our

1124
00:36:48,376 --> 0:36:50,626
commitment to protect user

1125
00:36:50,626 --> 0:36:51,106
privacy.

1126
00:36:52,566 --> 0:36:54,186
There are three things we want

1127
00:36:54,186 --> 0:36:55,626
you to remember today.

1128
00:36:56,166 --> 0:36:59,316
First, among the first questions

1129
00:36:59,536 --> 0:37:01,056
you should ask yourselves when

1130
00:36:59,536 --> 0:37:01,056
you should ask yourselves when

1131
00:37:01,056 --> 0:37:02,996
working on a new project is how

1132
00:37:02,996 --> 0:37:05,086
you will protect user data.

1133
00:37:05,546 --> 0:37:08,546
Ask what you should do, not what

1134
00:37:08,546 --> 0:37:11,026
you can do with your app.

1135
00:37:11,386 --> 0:37:13,996
Earn the trust of your users by

1136
00:37:13,996 --> 0:37:16,266
making it easy for them to know

1137
00:37:16,266 --> 0:37:18,126
that their privacy is protected

1138
00:37:18,176 --> 0:37:20,006
in your app.

1139
00:37:20,456 --> 0:37:22,846
Second, if you face a tough

1140
00:37:22,916 --> 0:37:25,106
privacy problem, challenge

1141
00:37:25,106 --> 0:37:26,776
yourself to find a solution.

1142
00:37:28,106 --> 0:37:30,766
Privacy is a chance to innovate.

1143
00:37:31,566 --> 0:37:33,316
Find a way to deliver your

1144
00:37:33,396 --> 0:37:36,106
feature without giving away more

1145
00:37:36,106 --> 0:37:36,666
user data.

1146
00:37:38,176 --> 0:37:40,496
And third, privacy is an

1147
00:37:40,496 --> 0:37:42,896
opportunity to engage with your

1148
00:37:42,896 --> 0:37:43,436
users.

1149
00:37:44,936 --> 0:37:47,206
Privacy is about people.

1150
00:37:48,496 --> 0:37:51,156
Don't let a privacy policy take

1151
00:37:51,156 --> 0:37:51,946
that away from you.

1152
00:37:52,656 --> 0:37:54,416
Share your privacy assurances

1153
00:37:54,776 --> 0:37:55,706
with your users.

1154
00:37:56,716 --> 0:37:58,246
If you have any more questions,

1155
00:37:58,536 --> 0:38:00,106
please join us in the privacy

1156
00:37:58,536 --> 0:38:00,106
please join us in the privacy

1157
00:38:00,106 --> 0:38:01,676
lab right after this talk.

1158
00:38:02,286 --> 0:38:03,866
On behalf of the entire privacy

1159
00:38:03,916 --> 0:38:05,546
team, thank you very much for

1160
00:38:05,546 --> 0:38:06,226
joining us today.
