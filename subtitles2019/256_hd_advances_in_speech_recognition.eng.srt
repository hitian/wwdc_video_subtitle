00:00:06,416 --> 0:00:08,846
&gt;&gt; Hi. I'm Neha Agrawal, and I'm

3
00:00:08,846 --> 0:00:10,516
a software engineer working on

4
00:00:10,516 --> 0:00:11,426
speech recognition.

5
00:00:12,426 --> 0:00:14,776
In 2016, we introduced the

6
00:00:14,776 --> 0:00:16,436
Speech Recognition framework for

7
00:00:16,686 --> 0:00:18,756
developers to solve their speech

8
00:00:18,756 --> 0:00:19,686
recognition needs.

9
00:00:20,326 --> 0:00:22,096
For anyone who is new to this

10
00:00:22,096 --> 0:00:24,096
framework, I highly recommend

11
00:00:24,316 --> 0:00:25,876
watching this Speech Recognition

12
00:00:25,876 --> 0:00:28,166
API session by my colleague

13
00:00:28,316 --> 0:00:29,246
Henry Mason.

14
00:00:31,066 --> 0:00:32,695
In this video, we're going to

15
00:00:32,695 --> 0:00:35,106
discuss exciting new advances in

16
00:00:35,106 --> 0:00:35,426
the APIs.

17
00:00:35,426 --> 0:00:36,906
Let's get started.

18
00:00:39,216 --> 0:00:40,596
Speech recognition is now

19
00:00:40,596 --> 0:00:42,206
supported for macOS.

20
00:00:43,036 --> 0:00:44,706
The support is available for

21
00:00:44,706 --> 0:00:47,376
both AppKit and iPad apps on

22
00:00:47,376 --> 0:00:47,716
Mac.

23
00:00:48,886 --> 0:00:51,536
Just like iOS, over 50 languages

24
00:00:51,536 --> 0:00:52,266
are supported.

25
00:00:53,816 --> 0:00:55,756
You need approval from your

26
00:00:55,756 --> 0:00:57,856
users to access the microphone

27
00:00:57,976 --> 0:00:59,616
and record their speech, and

28
00:01:00,406 --> 0:01:01,736
they also need to have Siri

29
00:01:01,736 --> 0:01:02,246
enabled.

30
00:01:02,876 --> 0:01:05,596
In addition to supporting speech

31
00:01:05,596 --> 0:01:08,366
recognition on macOS, we are now

32
00:01:08,366 --> 0:01:10,056
allowing developers to run

33
00:01:10,056 --> 0:01:12,026
recognition on-device for

34
00:01:12,026 --> 0:01:13,936
privacy sensitive applications.

35
00:01:14,646 --> 0:01:17,876
With on-device support, your

36
00:01:17,876 --> 0:01:19,746
user's data will not be sent to

37
00:01:19,746 --> 0:01:20,586
Apple servers.

38
00:01:22,096 --> 0:01:24,156
Your app no longer needs to rely

39
00:01:24,446 --> 0:01:27,136
on a network connection, and

40
00:01:27,136 --> 0:01:28,626
cellular data will not be

41
00:01:28,626 --> 0:01:29,196
consumed.

42
00:01:31,216 --> 0:01:33,556
However, there are tradeoffs to

43
00:01:33,556 --> 0:01:34,026
consider.

44
00:01:34,736 --> 0:01:37,426
Accuracy is good on-device, but

45
00:01:37,426 --> 0:01:39,536
you may find it is better on

46
00:01:39,536 --> 0:01:40,996
server due to a continuous

47
00:01:40,996 --> 0:01:41,416
learning.

48
00:01:41,666 --> 0:01:43,896
A server-based recognition

49
00:01:43,896 --> 0:01:46,246
support has limits on number of

50
00:01:46,246 --> 0:01:48,196
requests and audio duration.

51
00:01:48,976 --> 0:01:50,496
With on-device recognition,

52
00:01:50,876 --> 0:01:52,436
these limits do not apply.

53
00:01:53,726 --> 0:01:54,776
The number of languages

54
00:01:54,776 --> 0:01:57,256
supported on server are more

55
00:01:57,256 --> 0:01:58,536
than on-device.

56
00:01:59,846 --> 0:02:02,126
Also, if server isn't available,

57
00:01:59,846 --> 0:02:02,126
Also, if server isn't available,

58
00:02:02,126 --> 0:02:04,426
our server mode automatically

59
00:02:04,426 --> 0:02:06,376
falls back on on-device

60
00:02:06,376 --> 0:02:08,276
recognition if it is supported.

61
00:02:09,156 --> 0:02:11,736
All iPhones and iPads with Apple

62
00:02:12,156 --> 0:02:13,196
A9 or later processors are

63
00:02:13,196 --> 0:02:15,156
supported, and all Mac devices

64
00:02:15,156 --> 0:02:15,746
are supported.

65
00:02:16,776 --> 0:02:18,086
There are over 10 languages

66
00:02:18,086 --> 0:02:19,246
supported for on-device

67
00:02:19,246 --> 0:02:19,856
recognition.

68
00:02:20,426 --> 0:02:23,746
Now, let's look at how to enable

69
00:02:23,976 --> 0:02:25,876
on-device recognition in code.

70
00:02:26,536 --> 0:02:29,016
To recognize pre-recorded audio,

71
00:02:29,386 --> 0:02:30,986
we first create an

72
00:02:30,986 --> 0:02:33,066
SFSpeechRecognizer object and

73
00:02:33,066 --> 0:02:35,096
check for availability of speech

74
00:02:35,096 --> 0:02:36,856
recognition on that object.

75
00:02:39,206 --> 0:02:40,346
If speech recognition is

76
00:02:40,346 --> 0:02:42,516
available, we can create a

77
00:02:42,516 --> 0:02:44,376
recognition request with the

78
00:02:44,376 --> 0:02:46,366
audio file URL and start

79
00:02:46,366 --> 0:02:47,026
recognition.

80
00:02:49,676 --> 0:02:51,896
Now, in order to use on-device

81
00:02:51,896 --> 0:02:53,616
recognition, you need to first

82
00:02:53,616 --> 0:02:55,416
check if on-device recognition

83
00:02:55,416 --> 0:02:57,396
is supported and then set

84
00:02:57,606 --> 0:02:59,446
requiresOnDeviceRecognition

85
00:02:59,446 --> 0:03:01,396
property on the request object.

86
00:02:59,446 --> 0:03:01,396
property on the request object.

87
00:03:03,136 --> 0:03:04,586
Now that we have looked at this

88
00:03:04,586 --> 0:03:06,296
in code, let's talk about the

89
00:03:06,296 --> 0:03:07,006
results you get.

90
00:03:07,466 --> 0:03:11,466
Since iOS 10 in speech

91
00:03:11,466 --> 0:03:13,016
recognition results, we have

92
00:03:13,016 --> 0:03:14,616
provided transcriptions,

93
00:03:14,966 --> 0:03:16,486
alternative interpretations,

94
00:03:16,786 --> 0:03:18,456
confidence levels and timing

95
00:03:18,456 --> 0:03:19,096
information.

96
00:03:20,636 --> 0:03:22,146
We're making a few more

97
00:03:22,146 --> 0:03:23,616
additions to the speech

98
00:03:23,616 --> 0:03:24,556
recognition results.

99
00:03:26,776 --> 0:03:29,186
Speaking rate measures how fast

100
00:03:29,186 --> 0:03:31,016
a person speaks in words per

101
00:03:31,016 --> 0:03:31,396
minute.

102
00:03:33,366 --> 0:03:35,006
Average pause duration measures

103
00:03:35,276 --> 0:03:36,556
the average length of pause

104
00:03:36,556 --> 0:03:37,336
between words.

105
00:03:37,906 --> 0:03:41,086
And voice analytics features

106
00:03:41,306 --> 0:03:43,196
include various measures of

107
00:03:43,196 --> 0:03:44,566
vocal characteristics.

108
00:03:46,116 --> 0:03:47,906
Now, voice analytics gives

109
00:03:47,906 --> 0:03:49,416
insight into four features.

110
00:03:50,186 --> 0:03:52,216
Jitter measures how pitch varies

111
00:03:52,216 --> 0:03:52,726
in audio.

112
00:03:53,446 --> 0:03:55,296
With voice analytics, you can

113
00:03:55,296 --> 0:03:57,066
now understand the amount of

114
00:03:57,066 --> 0:03:59,066
jitter in speech expressed as a

115
00:03:59,066 --> 0:03:59,816
percentage.

116
00:04:01,236 --> 0:04:02,926
Shimmer measures how amplitude

117
00:04:02,926 --> 0:04:04,886
varies in audio, and with voice

118
00:04:04,886 --> 0:04:06,706
analytics, you can understand

119
00:04:06,706 --> 0:04:10,336
shimmer in speech expressed in

120
00:04:11,536 --> 0:04:11,946
decibels.

121
00:04:12,096 --> 0:04:13,376
Let's listen to some audio

122
00:04:13,376 --> 0:04:14,466
samples to understand what

123
00:04:14,466 --> 0:04:16,166
speech with high jitter and

124
00:04:16,166 --> 0:04:17,125
shimmer sounds like.

125
00:04:17,606 --> 0:04:19,526
First, let's hear audio with

126
00:04:19,526 --> 0:04:20,276
normal speech.

127
00:04:20,866 --> 0:04:21,546
&gt;&gt; Apple.

128
00:04:23,276 --> 0:04:24,756
&gt;&gt; Now, audio with perturbed

129
00:04:24,756 --> 0:04:25,236
speech.

130
00:04:25,956 --> 0:04:26,846
&gt;&gt; Apple.

131
00:04:27,926 --> 0:04:29,176
&gt;&gt; Next feature is pitch.

132
00:04:29,966 --> 0:04:31,976
Pitch measures the highness and

133
00:04:31,976 --> 0:04:33,286
lowness of the tone.

134
00:04:33,656 --> 0:04:35,476
Often, women and children have

135
00:04:35,476 --> 0:04:36,266
higher pitch.

136
00:04:37,496 --> 0:04:39,426
And voicing is used to identify

137
00:04:39,776 --> 0:04:41,766
voiced regions in speech.

138
00:04:42,316 --> 0:04:44,956
The voice analytics features are

139
00:04:44,956 --> 0:04:46,516
specific to an individual, and

140
00:04:46,516 --> 0:04:49,036
they can vary with time and

141
00:04:49,036 --> 0:04:49,926
circumstances.

142
00:04:50,636 --> 0:04:52,506
For example, if the person is

143
00:04:52,506 --> 0:04:54,876
tired, these features will be

144
00:04:54,876 --> 0:04:56,616
different than when they're not.

145
00:04:57,466 --> 0:04:59,346
Also, depending on who the

146
00:04:59,346 --> 0:05:00,996
person is talking to, these

147
00:04:59,346 --> 0:05:00,996
person is talking to, these

148
00:05:00,996 --> 0:05:01,976
features may vary.

149
00:05:04,416 --> 0:05:06,556
These new results are part of

150
00:05:06,556 --> 0:05:08,436
the SF transcription object and

151
00:05:08,436 --> 0:05:10,016
will be available periodically.

152
00:05:10,556 --> 0:05:12,776
We will have them at the end

153
00:05:12,986 --> 0:05:14,586
when the isFinal flag is sent,

154
00:05:14,996 --> 0:05:16,246
but we could also see them

155
00:05:16,246 --> 0:05:16,586
before.

156
00:05:17,306 --> 0:05:19,806
You can access speakingRate and

157
00:05:19,806 --> 0:05:21,796
averagePauseDuration as shown.

158
00:05:23,736 --> 0:05:26,566
To access voice analytics, you

159
00:05:26,566 --> 0:05:28,446
would have to access the SF

160
00:05:28,446 --> 0:05:30,346
transcription segment object,

161
00:05:30,586 --> 0:05:32,256
and then you can access it as

162
00:05:32,256 --> 0:05:32,846
shown here.

163
00:05:34,636 --> 0:05:37,006
To summarize, we have made three

164
00:05:37,006 --> 0:05:37,846
key advances.

165
00:05:38,506 --> 0:05:40,326
You can now build apps on macOS

166
00:05:40,656 --> 0:05:42,366
using speech recognition APIs.

167
00:05:43,546 --> 0:05:45,066
Speech recognition can be run

168
00:05:45,066 --> 0:05:47,196
on-device in a privacy-friendly

169
00:05:47,196 --> 0:05:47,606
manner.

170
00:05:48,386 --> 0:05:50,696
And you now have access to voice

171
00:05:50,696 --> 0:05:52,686
analytics features for getting

172
00:05:52,686 --> 0:05:54,076
insight into vocal

173
00:05:54,076 --> 0:05:55,136
characteristics.

174
00:05:57,176 --> 0:05:59,486
