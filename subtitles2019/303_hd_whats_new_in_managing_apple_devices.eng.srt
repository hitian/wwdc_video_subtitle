apps feature, formally known as

198
00:05:05,246 --> 0:05:06,416
this spring to allow

204
00:05:12,596 --> 0:05:16,416
custom apps to ASM, as well.

And speaking of accounts,

208
00:05:22,746 --> 0:05:24,066
earlier this spring, we added

00:05:24,066 --> 0:05:25,576
Federated authentication with

to ASM, and this fall, we're

212
00:05:29,756 --> 0:05:31,456
bringing that feature to ABM.

00:05:32,146 --> 0:05:32,746

This is a great audience.

00:05:38,066 --> 0:05:39,356
I'm also very pleased to

218
00:05:39,356 --> 0:05:40,896
announce that as of this week,

219
00:05:40,946 --> 0:05:43,296
both ABM and ASM are now fully

220
00:05:43,296 --> 0:05:45,156
supported on iPad on the

We love iPad, too.

00:05:51,136 --> 0:05:52,956
Again, making sure that you can

225
00:05:52,956 --> 0:05:55,656
use these services and apps on

226
00:05:55,656 --> 0:05:56,876
all of our platforms.

227
00:05:57,976 --> 0:05:59,566
In fact, ABM and ASM have been

228
00:05:59,566 --> 0:06:01,336
so successful that we are ending

00:06:05,486 --> 0:06:06,856
It's time to get on board with

234
00:06:06,856 --> 0:06:07,496
ABM and ASM.

235
00:06:08,846 --> 0:06:10,126
Because, in fact, you're getting

236
00:06:10,126 --> 0:06:12,976
even more benefits now with the

00:06:12,976 --> 0:06:14,646
same Managed Apple ID you use to

00:06:16,816 --> 0:06:18,506
access to the AppleSeed for IT,

240
00:06:18,976 --> 0:06:20,366
so that you can get all of the

00:06:20,366 --> 0:06:21,986
new beta software releases, like

242
00:06:21,986 --> 0:06:23,376
everything we seeded this week,

including documentation and test

245
00:06:26,916 --> 0:06:28,626
those new software releases will

246
00:06:28,626 --> 0:06:30,496
work well in your organization,

247
00:06:30,946 --> 0:06:32,536
and when you find some things

248
00:06:32,536 --> 0:06:34,396
you don't particularly like, use

252
00:06:39,836 --> 0:06:41,436
can associate those with your

00:06:49,246 --> 0:06:50,766
turn to another great example of

258
00:06:50,766 --> 0:06:52,336
how we provide you with the same

259
00:06:52,336 --> 0:06:53,706

00:07:05,446 --> 0:07:06,876
to manage student Macs with the

00:07:06,876 --> 0:07:08,206
same great feature set that

269
00:07:08,206 --> 0:07:09,536
they've grown to love while

270
00:07:09,536 --> 0:07:10,836
managing student iPads.

00:07:11,566 --> 0:07:12,826
On the left, you can see that

272
00:07:12,826 --> 0:07:14,076

00:07:14,076 --> 0:07:15,496

00:07:20,046 --> 0:07:21,986

278
00:07:21,986 --> 0:07:23,716
settings that configure certain

279
00:07:23,716 --> 0:07:25,306
classroom behaviors that you

280
00:07:25,306 --> 0:07:27,346

281
00:07:28,126 --> 0:07:29,986
including the ones that control

We also made all of the other

00:07:34,956 --> 0:07:36,356
screen viewing features that you

286
00:07:36,356 --> 0:07:38,096
know and love in macOS from

00:07:48,476 --> 0:07:49,836
of course, support Dark Mode on

regain student attention without

297
00:07:57,056 --> 0:07:58,956
needing to lock the device, we

298
00:07:58,956 --> 0:08:00,556
call it Hide Apps, and it works

299
00:07:58,956 --> 0:08:00,556
call it Hide Apps, and it works

300
00:08:00,556 --> 0:08:00,796
like this.

301
00:08:00,796 --> 0:08:03,046
When the teacher taps the new

302
00:08:03,086 --> 0:08:04,776
Hide button in the toolbar, the

303
00:08:04,776 --> 0:08:05,886
student is returned to home

304
00:08:05,886 --> 0:08:07,666
screen on their iPad.

305
00:08:08,916 --> 0:08:10,326
That concludes our Classroom

00:08:10,326 --> 0:08:10,826
update.

307
00:08:10,936 --> 0:08:12,066
Now I'd like to turn to a couple

308
00:08:12,066 --> 0:08:12,956
of other announcements that

309
00:08:12,956 --> 0:08:14,166
impact device management.

310
00:08:15,976 --> 0:08:17,166

00:08:20,356 --> 0:08:22,206
This may impact your MDM product

string to distinguish between

316
00:08:25,466 --> 0:08:28,056
iPad and Mac to customize your

317
00:08:28,056 --> 0:08:29,306
UI or your enrollment flow.

318
00:08:29,306 --> 0:08:30,516
You're going to need to stop

319
00:08:30,516 --> 0:08:32,535
doing that, because iPad now

320
00:08:32,535 --> 0:08:33,366

between security, privacy, and

manageability.

00:09:19,336 --> 0:09:21,636
And the first one is a really

356
00:09:40,066 --> 0:09:41,226
Until now, there have been two

357
00:09:41,226 --> 0:09:42,806
ways to manage iOS devices.

358
00:09:43,376 --> 0:09:44,856
Device enrollments provide many

device-wide management

360
00:09:45,836 --> 0:09:47,656
capabilities, and for

361
00:09:47,656 --> 0:09:49,046
institutionally owned devices

362
00:09:49,046 --> 0:09:50,756
that are supervised, automated

364
00:09:52,706 --> 0:09:53,526
of the device management

When users bring their personal

368
00:09:59,096 --> 0:10:01,066
devices to work or school, they

369
00:09:59,096 --> 0:10:01,066
devices to work or school, they

370
00:10:01,066 --> 0:10:02,756
don't really want the admin to

371
00:10:02,756 --> 0:10:04,736
manage the entire device, and

372
00:10:04,736 --> 0:10:06,386
BYOD admins don't really want to

373
00:10:06,386 --> 0:10:07,836
manage the entire device either.

374
00:10:08,186 --> 0:10:09,146
They just want to provide the

375

productive.

378
00:10:13,986 --> 0:10:15,606
Today, I'm presenting a new way

379
00:10:15,606 --> 0:10:17,556
to manage BYOD devices called

380
00:10:17,726 --> 0:10:18,656

382
00:10:23,306 --> 0:10:25,346
option that provides a better

383

balance for BYOD.

384
00:10:26,476 --> 0:10:28,236
It protects the privacy of

385
00:10:28,236 --> 0:10:29,786
personal data, while still

00:10:29,786 --> 0:10:31,056
securing corporate data.

00:10:31,996 --> 0:10:33,716
When users and admins achieve

388
00:10:33,716 --> 0:10:35,126
this better balance, there is

389
00:10:35,126 --> 0:10:36,896
greater acceptance of BYOD

390
00:10:36,896 --> 0:10:38,936
programs, and more productive

391
00:10:38,936 --> 0:10:39,436
users.

392
00:10:39,436 --> 0:10:40,946
Everyone wins.

393
00:10:42,046 --> 0:10:43,096
User enrollments are built on

394
00:10:43,096 --> 0:10:43,956
three pillars.

395
00:10:44,236 --> 0:10:46,036
The first is a Managed Apple ID,

396
00:10:46,036 --> 0:10:47,796
alongside the Personal Apple ID.

397
00:10:48,516 --> 0:10:50,076
The second is cryptographic

398
00:10:50,076 --> 0:10:52,676
separation of personal and work

399
00:10:52,736 --> 0:10:54,866
data, and the third is a limited

400
00:10:54,866 --> 0:10:56,546
set of device-wide management

401
00:10:56,546 --> 0:10:57,356
capabilities.

402
00:10:58,026 --> 0:11:01,586
A Managed Apple ID is required

403
00:10:58,026 --> 0:11:01,586
A Managed Apple ID is required

404
00:11:01,646 --> 0:11:02,586
for user enrollment.

405
00:11:03,056 --> 0:11:04,256
This is the anchor for the

406
00:11:04,256 --> 0:11:06,246
user's work identity on the

407
00:11:06,246 --> 0:11:06,796
device.

408
00:11:07,056 --> 0:11:08,626
Now this is not a multiuser

409
00:11:08,626 --> 0:11:09,056
system.

410
00:11:09,366 --> 0:11:10,736
It's a multi- persona system.

411
00:11:10,866 --> 0:11:12,256
It's the same user wearing

412
00:11:12,256 --> 0:11:13,106
different hats.

413
00:11:14,056 --> 0:11:15,756
The admin creates the Managed

414
00:11:15,756 --> 0:11:17,746
Apple ID in Apple School Manager

415
00:11:17,746 --> 0:11:19,136
or Apple Business Manager, and

416
00:11:19,386 --> 0:11:21,096
the user must sign into the

417
00:11:21,096 --> 0:11:22,646
Managed Apple ID during the

418
00:11:22,646 --> 0:11:23,886
enrollment process.

419
00:11:24,876 --> 0:11:26,416
Federated off means that this

420
00:11:26,416 --> 0:11:27,816
works very well for the user,

421
00:11:27,816 --> 0:11:28,886
since they are challenged for

422
00:11:28,886 --> 0:11:29,936
credentials that they already

423
00:11:29,936 --> 0:11:31,296
know from the organization.

424
00:11:32,086 --> 0:11:33,436
And when the enrollment ends,

425
00:11:33,686 --> 0:11:35,656
the Managed Apple ID is removed

426
00:11:35,656 --> 0:11:38,376
from the device.

427
00:11:38,536 --> 0:11:40,386
Managed Apps and Accounts use

428
00:11:40,446 --> 0:11:41,896
the Managed Apple ID's iCloud

429
00:11:41,896 --> 0:11:44,206
account and Personal Apps and

430
00:11:44,206 --> 0:11:45,886
Accounts use the personal Apple

431
00:11:45,886 --> 0:11:47,436
ID's iCloud account, if there is

432
00:11:47,436 --> 0:11:48,236
one signed in.

433
00:11:49,256 --> 0:11:50,866
Third-party apps are always

434
00:11:50,866 --> 0:11:52,496
entirely either managed or

435
00:11:52,496 --> 0:11:53,106
unmanaged.

436
00:11:53,196 --> 0:11:54,476
They can't change mode, and you

437
00:11:54,476 --> 0:11:56,056
can't run them in both modes at

438
00:11:56,056 --> 0:11:56,706
the same time.

439
00:11:57,756 --> 0:11:59,426
Some of the built-in apps like

440
00:11:59,426 --> 0:12:01,576
Notes, our account based, which

441
00:11:59,426 --> 0:12:01,576
Notes, our account based, which

442
00:12:01,576 --> 0:12:02,686
means they can handle both

443
00:12:02,956 --> 0:12:04,456
managed accounts and unmanaged

444
00:12:04,456 --> 0:12:06,056
accounts, and these apps will

445
00:12:06,056 --> 0:12:07,646
use the appropriate Apple ID,

446
00:12:07,646 --> 0:12:08,846
depending on which account they

447
00:12:08,846 --> 0:12:11,986
are operating on at the time.

448
00:12:11,986 --> 0:12:13,416
The next pillar is data

449
00:12:13,416 --> 0:12:14,026
separation.

450
00:12:14,736 --> 0:12:16,476
When the enrollment starts, iOS

451
00:12:16,656 --> 0:12:18,906
creates a managed APFS volume,

452
00:12:19,246 --> 0:12:20,106
and it uses separate

453
00:12:20,106 --> 0:12:21,506
cryptographic keys for this.

454
00:12:22,076 --> 0:12:23,906
When enrollment ends, iOS

455
00:12:23,906 --> 0:12:25,476
destroys the cryptographic keys

456
00:12:25,556 --> 0:12:26,366
and the volume.

457
00:12:26,366 --> 0:12:27,656
So, the data is gone.

458
00:12:28,156 --> 0:12:29,596
Now it's always been the case

459
00:12:29,596 --> 0:12:31,286
that iOS removes managed data

460
00:12:31,286 --> 0:12:32,256
when enrollment ends

461
00:12:32,256 --> 0:12:32,986
appropriately.

462
00:12:33,326 --> 0:12:34,916
So, this is a cryptographic

463
00:12:34,916 --> 0:12:36,196
backstop to make sure that the

464
00:12:36,196 --> 0:12:38,106
data is provably gone, just in

465
00:12:38,106 --> 0:12:39,226
case something goes wrong during

466
00:12:39,226 --> 0:12:40,386
the unenrollment process.

467
00:12:41,876 --> 0:12:43,956
The managed APFS volume contains

468
00:12:43,956 --> 0:12:45,686
the managed versions of all of

469
00:12:45,686 --> 0:12:46,416
these items.

470
00:12:47,096 --> 0:12:48,856
App containers are any local

471
00:12:48,856 --> 0:12:50,776
data stored by third-party apps.

472
00:12:51,726 --> 0:12:53,636
The Notes app stores local data

473
00:12:53,836 --> 0:12:55,436
for managed Notes accounts on

474
00:12:55,436 --> 0:12:57,616
the managed APFS volume and for

475
00:12:57,616 --> 0:12:59,336
personal notes accounts on the

476
00:12:59,336 --> 0:13:01,656
personal or system APFS volume.

477
00:12:59,336 --> 0:13:01,656
personal or system APFS volume.

478
00:13:03,446 --> 0:13:05,166
When iOS creates this managed

479
00:13:05,166 --> 0:13:07,476
APFS volume, it also creates a

480
00:13:07,476 --> 0:13:08,476
managed keychain.

481
00:13:09,016 --> 0:13:10,936
This stores any secure items

482
00:13:11,006 --> 0:13:12,536
that are saved by third-party

483
00:13:12,536 --> 0:13:13,806
apps like passwords and

484
00:13:13,806 --> 0:13:15,986
certificates, and it also stores

485
00:13:15,986 --> 0:13:17,566
the authentication credentials

486
00:13:17,686 --> 0:13:19,306
for managed accounts.

487
00:13:20,456 --> 0:13:22,206
Mail attachments and full email

488
00:13:22,206 --> 0:13:24,156
bodies are stored on the managed

489
00:13:24,156 --> 0:13:27,326
APFS partition, although there

490
00:13:27,326 --> 0:13:28,876
is a central database for mail

491
00:13:29,136 --> 0:13:30,206
that lives on the system

492
00:13:30,206 --> 0:13:31,606
partition that contains some

493
00:13:31,606 --> 0:13:33,616
metadata and five-line previews.

494
00:13:34,036 --> 0:13:35,216
Rest assured, this data is

495
00:13:35,216 --> 0:13:36,436
removed when the enrollment

496
00:13:36,436 --> 0:13:36,846
ends.

497
00:13:40,276 --> 0:13:42,526
Once the data is separated, the

498
00:13:42,526 --> 0:13:44,606
management of this data must be

499
00:13:44,606 --> 0:13:45,606
separated, as well.

500
00:13:46,126 --> 0:13:47,396
User enrollments have a few

501
00:13:47,396 --> 0:13:49,026
limited capabilities for

502
00:13:49,026 --> 0:13:50,516
managing the entire device, but

503
00:13:50,516 --> 0:13:52,016
they have no capabilities for

504
00:13:52,016 --> 0:13:53,726
managing personal apps and data.

505
00:13:55,306 --> 0:13:56,736
User enrollment management is

506
00:13:56,786 --> 0:13:58,726
based upon a modified version of

507
00:13:58,726 --> 0:13:59,916
the MDM protocol.

508
00:13:59,916 --> 0:14:02,786
And it starts the same way as

509
00:13:59,916 --> 0:14:02,786
And it starts the same way as

510
00:14:02,786 --> 0:14:03,956
device enrollments, with the

511
00:14:04,046 --> 0:14:05,486
enrollment profile.

512
00:14:06,056 --> 0:14:10,866
The Managed Apple ID key is what

513
00:14:10,866 --> 0:14:12,326
signifies this as a user

514
00:14:12,326 --> 0:14:12,856
enrollment.

515
00:14:13,166 --> 0:14:14,396
And the value of this is the

516
00:14:14,396 --> 0:14:16,026
user name of the managed Apple

517
00:14:16,106 --> 0:14:17,796
ID that the user must sign into.

518
00:14:19,136 --> 0:14:20,516
There's also a payload

519
00:14:20,516 --> 0:14:21,606
organization key.

520
00:14:21,746 --> 0:14:22,846
This is an existing key for

521
00:14:22,846 --> 0:14:24,166
device enrollments, but becomes

522
00:14:24,316 --> 0:14:26,006
particularly useful for user

523
00:14:26,006 --> 0:14:26,896
enrollments, because this

524
00:14:26,896 --> 0:14:28,556
identifies the managed accounts

525
00:14:28,556 --> 0:14:29,216
on the device.

526
00:14:29,486 --> 0:14:31,576
It will appear in Settings and

527
00:14:31,576 --> 0:14:32,656
in the Notes app and some other

528
00:14:32,656 --> 0:14:33,196
places.

529
00:14:34,026 --> 0:14:35,286
And also note that there's no

530
00:14:35,346 --> 0:14:36,776
access rights key here.

531
00:14:37,516 --> 0:14:38,856
Device enrollments use access

532
00:14:38,856 --> 0:14:39,926
rights to gate certain

533
00:14:39,926 --> 0:14:41,846
management capabilities for

534
00:14:41,846 --> 0:14:43,206
device enrollments, but these

535
00:14:43,206 --> 0:14:44,456
simply don't apply to the user

536
00:14:44,456 --> 0:14:44,876
enrollments.

537
00:14:44,876 --> 0:14:45,936
So, they're not specified.

538
00:14:47,836 --> 0:14:49,806
There's more differences between

539
00:14:49,806 --> 0:14:50,996
the device enrollment protocol

540
00:14:50,996 --> 0:14:52,236
and the user enrollment protocol

541
00:14:52,236 --> 0:14:52,946
than I go to can go through

542
00:14:52,946 --> 0:14:54,086
here, but I will cover the most

543
00:14:54,086 --> 0:14:54,816
important points.

544
00:14:55,576 --> 0:14:57,426
First of all, profile service

545
00:14:57,466 --> 0:14:59,186
profiles and user enrollments do

546
00:14:59,186 --> 0:14:59,766
not mix.

547
00:14:59,886 --> 0:15:01,456
You cannot use them to enroll,

548
00:14:59,886 --> 0:15:01,456
You cannot use them to enroll,

549
00:15:01,456 --> 0:15:03,016
and you can install one via a

550
00:15:03,016 --> 0:15:03,806
user enrollment.

551
00:15:05,576 --> 0:15:07,536
Device enrollments use the UDID

552
00:15:07,536 --> 0:15:09,096
as the primary identifier of the

553
00:15:09,096 --> 0:15:10,526
device that is communicating.

554
00:15:11,426 --> 0:15:13,706
User enrollments do not provide

555
00:15:13,706 --> 0:15:15,476
UDID or any other persistent

556
00:15:15,506 --> 0:15:17,086
identifier to the MDM server.

557
00:15:17,156 --> 0:15:18,586
This includes serial number,

558
00:15:18,786 --> 0:15:20,536
IMEI, MEID.

559
00:15:21,256 --> 0:15:22,976
Instead, when enrollment starts,

560
00:15:23,086 --> 0:15:25,216
iOS creates and enrollment ID,

561
00:15:25,866 --> 0:15:27,136
and this is communicated to the

562
00:15:27,136 --> 0:15:28,916
MDM server in all MDM

563
00:15:28,916 --> 0:15:29,736
communications.

564
00:15:30,966 --> 0:15:32,656
The MDM server can use this as

565
00:15:32,656 --> 0:15:34,096
its primary identifier for the

566
00:15:34,096 --> 0:15:34,616
enrollment.

567
00:15:35,606 --> 0:15:37,026
And when the enrollment ends,

568
00:15:37,646 --> 0:15:39,616
iOS destroys this enrollment ID.

569
00:15:39,706 --> 0:15:40,886
So, if the same device enrolls

570
00:15:40,886 --> 0:15:42,506
again, it will get a different

571
00:15:42,656 --> 0:15:43,466
enrollment ID.

572
00:15:44,636 --> 0:15:45,756
There's something similar for

573
00:15:45,756 --> 0:15:46,466
ActiveSync.

574
00:15:47,866 --> 0:15:49,746
When a user enrollment installs

575
00:15:49,746 --> 0:15:51,496
an exchange account, that goes

576
00:15:51,496 --> 0:15:53,016
into a user enrollment mode.

577
00:15:54,026 --> 0:15:57,676
It uses a EAS device identifier

578
00:15:57,896 --> 0:15:59,136
that was generated at the start

579
00:15:59,136 --> 0:15:59,986
of the enrollment, and it

580
00:15:59,986 --> 0:16:01,616
communicates it both to the

581
00:15:59,986 --> 0:16:01,616
communicates it both to the

582
00:16:01,616 --> 0:16:03,426
exchange server and to the MDM

583
00:16:03,426 --> 0:16:04,946
server in the device information

584
00:16:04,946 --> 0:16:06,096
query, so, they can use that to

585
00:16:06,156 --> 0:16:07,416
correlate as they usually do.

586
00:16:08,006 --> 0:16:09,266
And again, this is destroyed

587
00:16:09,266 --> 0:16:10,316
when the enrollment ends.

588
00:16:11,786 --> 0:16:13,906
And the token update command

589
00:16:14,016 --> 0:16:15,876
does not include the unlock

590
00:16:15,936 --> 0:16:16,326
token.

591
00:16:16,566 --> 0:16:17,916
This means that the MDM server

592
00:16:17,976 --> 0:16:19,236
cannot clear the device

593
00:16:19,286 --> 0:16:19,826
passcode.

594
00:16:22,726 --> 0:16:24,436
One of the top reasons why users

595
00:16:24,436 --> 0:16:26,826
reject BYOD programs is because

596
00:16:26,826 --> 0:16:27,776
they are concerned that the

597
00:16:27,776 --> 0:16:29,486
admin may erase the entire

598
00:16:29,486 --> 0:16:30,616
device, and they will lose their

599
00:16:30,616 --> 0:16:31,836
personal data on their own

600
00:16:31,836 --> 0:16:32,296
device.

601
00:16:32,756 --> 0:16:34,016
User enrollments do not the

602
00:16:34,016 --> 0:16:35,706
support Erase Device command.

603
00:16:37,516 --> 0:16:40,086
[ Applause ]

604
00:16:40,586 --> 0:16:42,586
And there's a similar thing for

605
00:16:42,586 --> 0:16:43,306
ActiveSync.

606
00:16:43,796 --> 0:16:45,316
If the exchange account is in

607
00:16:45,316 --> 0:16:46,746
user enrollment mode, the

608
00:16:46,746 --> 0:16:48,236
exchange server cannot send the

609
00:16:48,236 --> 0:16:49,226
RemoteWipe command.

610
00:16:49,726 --> 0:16:51,796
Instead, the MDM server can end

611
00:16:51,796 --> 0:16:54,046
the enrollment, and the exchange

612
00:16:54,046 --> 0:16:55,636
server can send the Account-only

613
00:16:55,636 --> 0:16:57,276
RemoteWipe, which only remove

614
00:16:57,276 --> 0:16:59,186
managed data in leave personal

615
00:16:59,996 --> 0:17:01,176
data untouched.

616
00:16:59,996 --> 0:17:01,176
data untouched.

617
00:17:01,366 --> 0:17:03,836
Some queries will only return

618
00:17:04,185 --> 0:17:05,296
the managed results.

619
00:17:05,366 --> 0:17:07,016
So, for instance, the MDM server

620
00:17:07,016 --> 0:17:08,646
cannot find out what personal

621
00:17:08,816 --> 0:17:09,786
apps are installed on the

622
00:17:09,786 --> 0:17:10,256
device.

623
00:17:11,415 --> 0:17:12,266
This is one place where we've

624
00:17:12,266 --> 0:17:13,665
added a new feature for device

625
00:17:13,665 --> 0:17:14,256
enrollments.

626
00:17:14,465 --> 0:17:16,486
They have a new managed-only key

627
00:17:16,816 --> 0:17:18,346
that filters the results in the

628
00:17:18,346 --> 0:17:19,596
same way.

629
00:17:22,516 --> 0:17:24,516
When installing applications,

630
00:17:24,656 --> 0:17:26,165
user enrollments cannot take

631
00:17:26,165 --> 0:17:27,935
over or abandon management of an

632
00:17:27,935 --> 0:17:28,026
app.

633
00:17:28,906 --> 0:17:30,496
The app is always removed when

634
00:17:30,496 --> 0:17:31,386
the enrollment ends.

635
00:17:31,976 --> 0:17:33,026
User enrollments support

636
00:17:33,026 --> 0:17:35,706
enterprise app distribution, and

637
00:17:35,706 --> 0:17:36,926
user-based VPP with

638
00:17:37,006 --> 0:17:37,986
PurchaseMethod 1.

639
00:17:38,386 --> 0:17:40,056
This ensures that the purchase

640
00:17:40,056 --> 0:17:41,616
goes on the managed Apple ID,

641
00:17:41,866 --> 0:17:43,986
not the personal Apple ID.

642
00:17:46,636 --> 0:17:48,696
For VPN, user enrollments

643
00:17:48,696 --> 0:17:50,206
support the Per-app VPN, and

644
00:17:50,206 --> 0:17:51,496
we've expanded it with some new

645
00:17:51,496 --> 0:17:51,986
keys.

646
00:17:52,596 --> 0:17:54,726
These keys help guide the

647
00:17:54,726 --> 0:17:56,006
traffic for the related

648
00:17:56,006 --> 0:17:57,416
protocols through the Per-app

649
00:17:57,416 --> 0:17:57,666
VPN.

650
00:17:58,376 --> 0:17:59,506
These are also available for

651
00:17:59,506 --> 0:18:01,976
device enrollments, but for user

652
00:17:59,506 --> 0:18:01,976
device enrollments, but for user

653
00:18:01,976 --> 0:18:02,926
enrollments, there's a very

654
00:18:02,926 --> 0:18:04,406
important limitation on these,

655
00:18:04,406 --> 0:18:06,316
which is that the second-level

656
00:18:06,316 --> 0:18:08,536
domain of the VPN server must

657
00:18:08,576 --> 0:18:10,586
match the second-level domain in

658
00:18:10,586 --> 0:18:11,826
the values for these keys.

659
00:18:12,056 --> 0:18:14,246
So, for instance, if the VPN

660
00:18:14,246 --> 0:18:18,016
server is VPN.acme.com, the mail

661
00:18:18,016 --> 0:18:19,276
domains can include

662
00:18:19,316 --> 0:18:21,816
mail.acme.com, but they cannot

663
00:18:21,816 --> 0:18:23,886
include mail.aol.com.

664
00:18:24,396 --> 0:18:25,566
This ensures that only the

665
00:18:25,566 --> 0:18:27,156
managed accounts are guided

666
00:18:27,156 --> 0:18:28,546
through the Per-app VPN.

667
00:18:29,756 --> 0:18:31,976
If a user enrollment installs a

668
00:18:31,976 --> 0:18:34,026
passcode policy, iOS will

669
00:18:34,026 --> 0:18:35,976
enforce a six-digit not simple

670
00:18:35,976 --> 0:18:36,586
passcode.

671
00:18:39,396 --> 0:18:41,246
And it does not support more

672
00:18:41,246 --> 0:18:42,796
complex passcode requirements.

673
00:18:43,326 --> 0:18:44,366
The main reason for this is

674
00:18:44,366 --> 0:18:47,126
because a more complex passcode

675
00:18:47,256 --> 0:18:49,586
requirement increases the risk

676
00:18:49,586 --> 0:18:50,726
that the user will forget the

677
00:18:50,726 --> 0:18:53,056
passcode, and the MDM server

678
00:18:53,096 --> 0:18:54,296
can't help out the user in this

679
00:18:54,296 --> 0:18:55,536
case by clearing the passcode.

680
00:18:55,536 --> 0:18:56,796
So, it would be unfair to

681
00:18:56,956 --> 0:18:57,756
require this.

682
00:18:58,926 --> 0:19:00,296
For more information on why this

683
00:18:58,926 --> 0:19:00,296
For more information on why this

684
00:19:00,296 --> 0:19:02,196
is the sweet spot for passcode

685
00:19:02,196 --> 0:19:03,656
policies, I suggest reading the

686
00:19:03,656 --> 0:19:05,556
latest edition of iOS security

687
00:19:05,556 --> 0:19:06,046
document.

688
00:19:07,086 --> 0:19:09,036
If you need proxying for Wi-Fi,

689
00:19:09,566 --> 0:19:11,016
use WPAD configured on the

690
00:19:11,016 --> 0:19:11,736
access points.

691
00:19:11,906 --> 0:19:13,426
The Wi-Fi payload does not

692
00:19:13,426 --> 0:19:15,066
support any of the proxy keys.

693
00:19:15,926 --> 0:19:17,746
And defaults in logging payloads

694
00:19:17,896 --> 0:19:18,746
are not supported.

695
00:19:19,106 --> 0:19:21,746
Now these are very useful for

696
00:19:21,746 --> 0:19:23,256
troubleshooting or for reporting

697
00:19:23,256 --> 0:19:25,176
issues to Apple, and they can be

698
00:19:25,176 --> 0:19:26,776
installed, but it must be done

699
00:19:26,776 --> 0:19:27,536
by the user.

700
00:19:27,666 --> 0:19:28,996
So that they have a chance to

701
00:19:28,996 --> 0:19:30,536
accept the changes that these

702
00:19:30,536 --> 0:19:31,676
will make to their personal

703
00:19:34,456 --> 0:19:34,616
device.

704
00:19:34,776 --> 0:19:36,036
User enrollments do support some

705
00:19:36,036 --> 0:19:36,726
restrictions.

706
00:19:37,116 --> 0:19:38,516
Managed Open In is available,

707
00:19:38,686 --> 0:19:40,166
and the allowLockScreen

708
00:19:40,166 --> 0:19:41,696
restrictions are there, so that

709
00:19:41,696 --> 0:19:43,256
managed data does not appear on

710
00:19:43,256 --> 0:19:43,866
the lock screen.

711
00:19:44,546 --> 0:19:47,166
But it doesn't support any of

712
00:19:47,166 --> 0:19:48,116
the supervised-only

713
00:19:48,116 --> 0:19:49,696
restrictions, and it doesn't

714
00:19:49,696 --> 0:19:51,336
support any of the restrictions

715
00:19:51,336 --> 0:19:52,366
that really have nothing to do

716
00:19:52,366 --> 0:19:54,386
with managed data like content

717
00:19:54,386 --> 0:19:55,786
ratings or ones that turn off

718
00:19:55,786 --> 0:19:57,216
major features like iCloud.

719
00:19:58,736 --> 0:20:00,136
These also apply to their

720
00:19:58,736 --> 0:20:00,136
These also apply to their

721
00:20:00,136 --> 0:20:01,586
ActiveSync equivalents when an

722
00:20:01,586 --> 0:20:02,966
exchange account is in user

723
00:20:02,966 --> 0:20:03,596
enrollment mode.

724
00:20:04,846 --> 0:20:06,206
And I have an important warning

725
00:20:06,256 --> 0:20:08,006
for MDM server developers.

726
00:20:08,826 --> 0:20:10,166
Make sure that your server is

727
00:20:10,166 --> 0:20:12,266
resilient to unexpected or

728
00:20:12,266 --> 0:20:14,426
absent keys and the results, as

729
00:20:14,736 --> 0:20:16,666
these capabilities are going to

730
00:20:16,666 --> 0:20:16,976
change over time.

731
00:20:20,366 --> 0:20:21,256
Now I'd like to welcome my

732
00:20:21,256 --> 0:20:22,726
colleague Ren to the stage to

733
00:20:22,726 --> 0:20:24,056
demonstrate the user enrollment.

734
00:20:24,316 --> 0:20:24,586
Ren?

735
00:20:25,516 --> 0:20:30,006
[ Applause ]

736
00:20:30,506 --> 0:20:30,986
&gt;&gt; Thanks Bob.

737
00:20:40,756 --> 0:20:42,126
&gt;&gt; All right, hi everyone.

738
00:20:42,336 --> 0:20:43,996
My name is Ren, and today, I'm

739
00:20:43,996 --> 0:20:45,216
going to demo the user

740
00:20:45,216 --> 0:20:45,856
enrollment flow.

741
00:20:46,626 --> 0:20:47,796
Just like device enrollment,

742
00:20:48,156 --> 0:20:49,716
user enrollment starts with the

743
00:20:49,716 --> 0:20:50,606
profile, as well.

744
00:20:51,356 --> 0:20:53,066
To get that profile, today I'm

745
00:20:53,066 --> 0:20:54,996
going to go to an actual website

746
00:20:55,196 --> 0:20:56,766
of a company called Acme Inc.

747
00:21:00,066 --> 0:21:01,176
This is the website, and please

748
00:21:01,176 --> 0:21:03,336
be aware that this is just a

749
00:21:03,396 --> 0:21:04,096
demo website.

750
00:21:04,516 --> 0:21:05,606
In the real world, you might

751
00:21:05,606 --> 0:21:07,036
have to authenticate first to

752
00:21:07,036 --> 0:21:08,106
download anything.

753
00:21:08,476 --> 0:21:10,046
But we skipped that step in this

754
00:21:10,366 --> 0:21:10,636
demo.

755
00:21:11,756 --> 0:21:14,076
And as Bob has said, user

756
00:21:14,076 --> 0:21:16,006
enrollment works very closely

757
00:21:16,066 --> 0:21:17,556
with the Managed Apple ID.

758
00:21:18,236 --> 0:21:19,826
So, I will have to provide this

759
00:21:19,826 --> 0:21:21,716
ID information to this website

760
00:21:22,066 --> 0:21:23,436
to have it download, or

761
00:21:23,436 --> 0:21:24,966
generate, a profile for me.

762
00:21:25,896 --> 0:21:28,426
Let me paste in the username and

763
00:21:28,426 --> 0:21:29,436
type on the enroll button.

764
00:21:30,086 --> 0:21:32,866
Read the warning carefully, and

765
00:21:32,866 --> 0:21:34,206
now, the profile has been

766
00:21:34,206 --> 0:21:35,326
downloaded to my phone.

767
00:21:35,716 --> 0:21:37,966
Let's go to Settings to check it

768
00:21:39,186 --> 0:21:39,266
out.

769
00:21:39,536 --> 0:21:41,076
After opening Settings, who will

770
00:21:41,076 --> 0:21:42,896
notice that a new cell with

771
00:21:43,046 --> 0:21:44,966
text, "Enroll in Acme Inc.," has

772
00:21:44,966 --> 0:21:46,366
been added to this page.

773
00:21:46,866 --> 0:21:48,546
And that is the shortcut to

774
00:21:48,756 --> 0:21:50,756
start user enrollment, and I'm

775
00:21:50,756 --> 0:21:54,216
going to take it now.

776
00:21:54,456 --> 0:21:56,376
This is a new UI we made for

777
00:21:56,376 --> 0:21:57,086
user enrollment.

778
00:21:57,766 --> 0:21:59,056
We merged the profile's

779
00:21:59,056 --> 0:22:00,636
basic information, the

780
00:21:59,056 --> 0:22:00,636
basic information, the

781
00:22:00,636 --> 0:22:02,676
warning, and consent all into

782
00:22:02,676 --> 0:22:03,306
one page.

783
00:22:03,816 --> 0:22:05,206
We hope this will make your

784
00:22:05,206 --> 0:22:06,666
profile installation experience

785
00:22:06,966 --> 0:22:07,646
much smoother.

786
00:22:08,696 --> 0:22:10,526
Also, if you want to dig more

787
00:22:10,526 --> 0:22:11,746
into the details of this

788
00:22:11,746 --> 0:22:13,566
profile, you can do that by

789
00:22:13,566 --> 0:22:15,266
tapping on the Details button at

790
00:22:15,266 --> 0:22:15,866
the top right.

791
00:22:16,426 --> 0:22:19,656
Let's take a look at the MDM

792
00:22:19,656 --> 0:22:21,206
payload of this profile.

793
00:22:21,756 --> 0:22:24,566
And you will notice that the

794
00:22:24,566 --> 0:22:27,046
managed Apple ID I provided at

795
00:22:27,046 --> 0:22:28,946
the website has been added to

796
00:22:28,946 --> 0:22:30,906
this payload, and this is the

797
00:22:30,906 --> 0:22:32,396
key to trigger user enrollment.

798
00:22:33,156 --> 0:22:35,156
Also, we removed the Access

799
00:22:35,156 --> 0:22:36,226
Rights section from this

800
00:22:36,226 --> 0:22:38,056
payload, because it's not needed

801
00:22:38,166 --> 0:22:39,056
with user enrollment.

802
00:22:40,096 --> 0:22:41,266
Something that you might not

803
00:22:41,266 --> 0:22:43,646
have noticed is if you go back

804
00:22:43,756 --> 0:22:45,076
to the top-level page of this

805
00:22:45,146 --> 0:22:47,476
profile, you won't find any

806
00:22:47,476 --> 0:22:48,956
warning talking about the things

807
00:22:49,006 --> 0:22:50,676
the company can do to the

808
00:22:50,676 --> 0:22:52,176
employee's -- this device.

809
00:22:52,846 --> 0:22:54,396
And that is because, as Bob has

810
00:22:54,426 --> 0:22:55,986
mentioned, we carefully

811
00:22:55,986 --> 0:22:58,826
restricted the capability of the

812
00:22:58,826 --> 0:22:59,356
MDM server.

813
00:22:59,696 --> 0:23:01,556
So, it won't be able to disturb

814
00:22:59,696 --> 0:23:01,556
So, it won't be able to disturb

815
00:23:01,856 --> 0:23:03,416
your personal user experience

816
00:23:03,646 --> 0:23:04,906
using your personal device.

817
00:23:06,176 --> 0:23:07,896
Everything seems fine so far.

818
00:23:07,896 --> 0:23:08,906
Let's continue profile

819
00:23:08,906 --> 0:23:10,756
installation by tapping on the

820
00:23:10,756 --> 0:23:12,446
big rounded corner button on the

821
00:23:12,446 --> 0:23:12,826
bottom.

822
00:23:13,446 --> 0:23:15,636
I will provide my device

823
00:23:15,696 --> 0:23:19,586
password, and now I'm prompted

824
00:23:19,586 --> 0:23:21,276
to sign in this Managed Apple

825
00:23:21,276 --> 0:23:21,526
ID.

826
00:23:22,296 --> 0:23:23,556
So, depend on whether this

827
00:23:23,646 --> 0:23:26,046
account is Federated or not, the

828
00:23:26,046 --> 0:23:27,276
UI you see here might be

829
00:23:27,336 --> 0:23:28,046
slightly different.

830
00:23:28,726 --> 0:23:29,746
Here I'm just using a

831
00:23:29,746 --> 0:23:31,476
non-Federated regular account.

832
00:23:31,816 --> 0:23:33,266
So, I just have to type in my

833
00:23:33,366 --> 0:23:36,416
password for this account, and

834
00:23:36,506 --> 0:23:37,956
tap on sign in to continue.

835
00:23:38,626 --> 0:23:40,786
Now, a bunch of things are

836
00:23:40,786 --> 0:23:41,736
happening on the background.

837
00:23:42,216 --> 0:23:44,046
We have created a separate disk

838
00:23:44,046 --> 0:23:45,606
volume on this device for

839
00:23:45,606 --> 0:23:46,436
enterprise usage.

840
00:23:46,916 --> 0:23:48,476
We are signing in this Managed

841
00:23:48,476 --> 0:23:49,986
Apple ID to this device and

842
00:23:50,136 --> 0:23:51,886
enrolling this device into the

843
00:23:51,946 --> 0:23:52,566
MDM server.

844
00:23:53,396 --> 0:23:54,886
All these steps are tied

845
00:23:54,956 --> 0:23:56,976
together, so if either of them

846
00:23:57,056 --> 0:23:58,486
failed, they will revert

847
00:23:58,516 --> 0:24:00,206
everything and pretend like

848
00:23:58,516 --> 0:24:00,206
everything and pretend like

849
00:24:00,206 --> 0:24:01,146
nothing has happened.

850
00:24:02,216 --> 0:24:03,666
Now the user enrollment has

851
00:24:03,846 --> 0:24:05,096
completed successfully.

852
00:24:05,536 --> 0:24:07,496
The MDM server can start sending

853
00:24:07,556 --> 0:24:09,096
MDM commands like install

854
00:24:09,096 --> 0:24:10,556
application, curate device

855
00:24:10,556 --> 0:24:11,926
information, etc., to this

856
00:24:11,986 --> 0:24:12,266
device.

857
00:24:13,006 --> 0:24:14,436
The pop-up you see now, it

858
00:24:14,436 --> 0:24:15,796
actually came from the MDM

859
00:24:15,796 --> 0:24:18,306
server asking me to install an

860
00:24:18,306 --> 0:24:19,136
app called Slack.

861
00:24:19,666 --> 0:24:21,556
Let's approve it, and the

862
00:24:21,556 --> 0:24:22,766
installation shall start

863
00:24:22,816 --> 0:24:23,276
shortly.

864
00:24:23,746 --> 0:24:26,526
Another tip about user

865
00:24:26,526 --> 0:24:28,266
enrollment is, if you want to

866
00:24:28,266 --> 0:24:29,806
check out the account we just

867
00:24:29,866 --> 0:24:31,576
signed in, you can do that by

868
00:24:31,576 --> 0:24:35,316
going to Settings, Account and

869
00:24:35,426 --> 0:24:36,766
Password -- Password and

870
00:24:36,766 --> 0:24:38,996
Accounts, and you will find that

871
00:24:38,996 --> 0:24:40,266
interface account there.

872
00:24:41,016 --> 0:24:42,536
The same account has also been

873
00:24:42,536 --> 0:24:44,776
added to apps like Files and

874
00:24:44,776 --> 0:24:46,306
Notes, and it's ready for you to

875
00:24:46,306 --> 0:24:46,566
use.

876
00:24:47,286 --> 0:24:48,526
Let's take a look at the Files,

877
00:24:48,526 --> 0:24:49,226
for example.

878
00:24:49,846 --> 0:24:52,426
After opening files, you will

879
00:24:52,426 --> 0:24:54,536
notice that a new iCloud drive

880
00:24:54,666 --> 0:24:56,396
with tag Enterprise has been

881
00:24:56,396 --> 0:24:59,266
added to Files, and all your

882
00:24:59,266 --> 0:25:00,996
enterprise data will be sent

883
00:24:59,266 --> 0:25:00,996
enterprise data will be sent

884
00:25:01,346 --> 0:25:02,416
through this iCloud drive.

885
00:25:03,586 --> 0:25:04,726
All right that's it for demo.

886
00:25:04,976 --> 0:25:06,186
Thanks for watching, and back to

887
00:25:06,186 --> 0:25:06,546
you, Bob.

[ Applause ]

889
00:25:16,196 --> 0:25:17,516
&gt;&gt; User enrollments are also

890
00:25:17,516 --> 0:25:18,836
supported on macOS.

891
00:25:19,576 --> 0:25:20,866
They work with a Managed Apple

892
00:25:20,956 --> 0:25:21,326
ID.

893
00:25:21,736 --> 0:25:23,496
It creates a managed APFS

894
00:25:23,496 --> 0:25:24,166
volume.

895
00:25:24,666 --> 0:25:26,336
Notes data is fully separated

896
00:25:26,336 --> 0:25:27,386
between the volumes, depending

897
00:25:27,386 --> 0:25:28,616
on the account, and the

898
00:25:28,616 --> 0:25:29,896
management capabilities are

899
00:25:29,896 --> 0:25:31,546
similar to what I described for

900
00:25:31,546 --> 0:25:32,896
iOS, although there are some

901
00:25:32,896 --> 0:25:34,406
platform-specific differences.

902
00:25:35,536 --> 0:25:37,116
This allows users to access the

903
00:25:37,116 --> 0:25:39,376
same Managed Apple ID on their

904
00:25:39,566 --> 0:25:42,556
personal iOS device and on their

905
00:25:45,216 --> 0:25:45,326
Mac.

906
00:25:45,546 --> 0:25:46,576
user enrollments provide a

907
00:25:46,646 --> 0:25:48,156
better balance for BYOD.

908
00:25:48,156 --> 0:25:50,906
It's time to set a new agreement

909
00:25:50,906 --> 0:25:52,656
between admins and their users.

910
00:25:53,286 --> 0:25:54,626
Admins should evaluate user

911
00:25:54,626 --> 0:25:56,536
enrollments, and they should

912
00:25:56,536 --> 0:25:58,066
reevaluate their security

913
00:25:58,066 --> 0:25:59,966
policies and shed some of these

914
00:25:59,966 --> 0:26:01,396
outdated requirements that don't

915
00:25:59,966 --> 0:26:01,396
outdated requirements that don't

916
00:26:01,396 --> 0:26:03,226
make sense on modern devices.

917
00:26:04,086 --> 0:26:05,906
Admins should provide a privacy

918
00:26:05,966 --> 0:26:08,126
policy to protect and reassure

919
00:26:08,126 --> 0:26:08,816
their users.

920
00:26:09,316 --> 0:26:10,696
We think this is the best way to

921
00:26:10,696 --> 0:26:12,516
bring BYOD devices into an

922
00:26:12,516 --> 0:26:13,096
organization.

925
00:26:20,496 --> 0:26:21,726
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much, Bob and

926
00:26:21,726 --> 0:26:23,626
Ren, and now I'd like to take us

927
00:26:23,656 --> 0:26:25,206
through a couple of other topics

928
00:26:25,206 --> 0:26:27,026
related to balancing these

929
00:26:27,026 --> 0:26:27,636
values.

930
00:26:28,266 --> 0:26:29,146
The first, Certificate

931
00:26:29,146 --> 0:26:30,866
Transparency, an important new

932
00:26:30,866 --> 0:26:32,246
security enhancement that we

933
00:26:32,246 --> 0:26:33,686
brought to all of our OSs last

934
00:26:33,686 --> 0:26:34,126
December.

935
00:26:35,106 --> 0:26:37,756
However, this can sometimes leak

936
00:26:37,756 --> 0:26:39,046
internal host names to public

937
00:26:39,046 --> 0:26:40,576
logs that enterprises might be

938
00:26:40,576 --> 0:26:41,286
concerned about.

939
00:26:41,606 --> 0:26:43,166
So, at the same time, we added a

940
00:26:43,166 --> 0:26:44,846
new payload, enabling them to

941
00:26:44,846 --> 0:26:46,976
opt out specifically sensitive

942
00:26:46,976 --> 0:26:48,856
certificates or domains, and

943
00:26:48,856 --> 0:26:49,806
they can install as many

944
00:26:49,806 --> 0:26:51,326
payloads as they need to manage

945
00:26:51,326 --> 0:26:53,476
all of those sensitive items.

946
00:26:54,976 --> 0:26:56,966
We also added support for WPA3

947
00:26:56,966 --> 0:26:58,736
security type to the Wi-Fi

948
00:26:58,826 --> 0:27:00,446
payload, including both personal

949
00:26:58,826 --> 0:27:00,446
payload, including both personal

950
00:27:00,446 --> 0:27:02,066
and enterprise authentication.

951
00:27:02,616 --> 0:27:05,526
We also wanted to make it much

952
00:27:05,526 --> 0:27:07,116
easier for MDM servers to use

953
00:27:07,116 --> 0:27:08,456
the newer, more efficient push

954
00:27:08,456 --> 0:27:10,676
API to communicate with all of

955
00:27:10,676 --> 0:27:11,816
their enrolled devices.

956
00:27:12,156 --> 0:27:13,856
So, we now support token-based

957
00:27:13,856 --> 0:27:16,496
authentication for APNS.

958
00:27:16,496 --> 0:27:20,106
Now this is not new.

959
00:27:20,106 --> 0:27:21,536
We talked about this last year,

960
00:27:21,536 --> 0:27:22,726
but this year, we're actually

961
00:27:22,726 --> 0:27:24,096
enforcing that if you're using a

962
00:27:24,096 --> 0:27:26,406
device enrollment, those devices

963
00:27:26,536 --> 0:27:28,136
will be supervised and

964
00:27:28,136 --> 0:27:29,436
enrollment will be mandatory.

965
00:27:30,376 --> 0:27:31,436
And this year, we're taking the

966
00:27:31,436 --> 0:27:32,986
opportunity to further deprecate

967
00:27:32,986 --> 0:27:34,656
the allow pairing key, because

968
00:27:34,656 --> 0:27:36,186
that sets that value permanently

969
00:27:36,186 --> 0:27:37,186
at enrollment time.

970
00:27:37,736 --> 0:27:39,386
Instead, we recommend using the

971
00:27:39,386 --> 0:27:41,026
existing configuration profile

972
00:27:41,026 --> 0:27:42,306
restriction, which can be

973
00:27:42,306 --> 0:27:43,366
changed at any time.

974
00:27:43,366 --> 0:27:46,986
Now I'd like to turn to a number

975
00:27:46,986 --> 0:27:49,836
of macOS-specific topics related

976
00:27:49,836 --> 0:27:51,176
to, again, mitigating the

977
00:27:51,176 --> 0:27:52,436
impacts of various security

978
00:27:52,436 --> 0:27:53,856
improvements on manageability.

979
00:27:54,546 --> 0:27:55,736
The first, a security

980
00:27:55,736 --> 0:27:57,426
improvement introduced in Mojave

981
00:27:57,546 --> 0:27:59,346
that made it more difficult to

982
00:27:59,346 --> 0:28:00,846
enable remote management when

983
00:27:59,346 --> 0:28:00,846
enable remote management when

984
00:28:00,846 --> 0:28:01,986
configuring new Macs.

985
00:28:02,706 --> 0:28:05,416
In macOS X.14.4, we added a pair

986
00:28:05,416 --> 0:28:06,886
of new commands that enable you

987
00:28:06,886 --> 0:28:08,786
to enable remote desktop

988
00:28:08,786 --> 0:28:11,416
management via two MDM commands,

989
00:28:12,336 --> 0:28:13,676
and they also configure the most

990
00:28:13,676 --> 0:28:14,946
common options that you'll need

991
00:28:14,946 --> 0:28:16,366
for ongoing management of those

992
00:28:16,366 --> 0:28:17,876
Macs, using Remote Desktop.

993
00:28:20,636 --> 0:28:22,666
We also wanted to allow you to

994
00:28:23,046 --> 0:28:24,536
use your mobile accounts with

995
00:28:24,536 --> 0:28:25,836
Macs using FileVault.

996
00:28:25,836 --> 0:28:27,846
So, there's a new capability

997
00:28:27,846 --> 0:28:29,876
that MDM servers can manage a

998
00:28:29,876 --> 0:28:31,086
new bootstrap token.

999
00:28:31,766 --> 0:28:33,096
They asked the client Mac for

1000
00:28:33,096 --> 0:28:34,676
that token, and then escrow it

1001
00:28:34,676 --> 0:28:35,676
themselves.

1002
00:28:36,086 --> 0:28:37,646
Then whenever a new user signs

1003
00:28:37,646 --> 0:28:39,426
in on that Mac, it will request

1004
00:28:39,426 --> 0:28:40,836
the bootstrap token from the MDM

1005
00:28:40,836 --> 0:28:42,556
server and use it to generate

1006
00:28:42,556 --> 0:28:44,036
the SecureToken needed to mount

1007
00:28:44,036 --> 0:28:45,336
the file systems and boot the

1008
00:28:45,336 --> 0:28:45,466
Mac.

1009
00:28:46,516 --> 0:28:48,546
[ Applause ]

1010
00:28:49,046 --> 0:28:50,186
We think this will great for

1011
00:28:50,186 --> 0:28:51,596
helping with password changes in

1012
00:28:51,596 --> 0:28:52,376
your organization.

1013
00:28:53,006 --> 0:28:55,996
Now the privacy policy payload

1014
00:28:55,996 --> 0:28:58,226
is not new in Catalina, though

1015
00:28:58,226 --> 0:28:59,906
it's also a great example of a

1016
00:28:59,906 --> 0:29:01,506
way that we help you mitigate

1017
00:28:59,906 --> 0:29:01,506
way that we help you mitigate

1018
00:29:01,506 --> 0:29:03,126
the impact of important security

1019
00:29:03,126 --> 0:29:04,426
enhancements on your ability to

1020
00:29:04,426 --> 0:29:06,316
manage Apple devices, and

1021
00:29:06,316 --> 0:29:07,226
there's some new security

1022
00:29:07,226 --> 0:29:08,926
enhancements in macOS Catalina

1023
00:29:08,926 --> 0:29:10,516
that are now also configurable

1024
00:29:10,516 --> 0:29:11,436
using this policy.

1025
00:29:11,986 --> 0:29:13,606
For example, enabling keyloggers

1026
00:29:13,606 --> 0:29:14,486
or screen recording in the

1027
00:29:14,486 --> 0:29:16,806
background, or whitelisting your

1028
00:29:16,806 --> 0:29:18,046
internal apps that you don't

1029
00:29:18,046 --> 0:29:19,716
want to notarize, so that they

1030
00:29:19,716 --> 0:29:20,996
continue to run, even though

1031
00:29:20,996 --> 0:29:22,786
macOS Catalina requires that

1032
00:29:22,786 --> 0:29:24,186
apps and text be notarized.

1033
00:29:27,476 --> 0:29:29,866
Next, there is a new change that

1034
00:29:29,866 --> 0:29:32,066
is new in macOS, Catalina,

1035
00:29:32,476 --> 0:29:33,496
where, again, we're tweaking the

1036
00:29:33,496 --> 0:29:34,686
balance between security

1037
00:29:34,686 --> 0:29:35,616
manageability.

1038
00:29:36,236 --> 0:29:38,476
Enabling FileVault via MDM now

1039
00:29:38,476 --> 0:29:39,906
requires user-approved MDM

1040
00:29:39,906 --> 0:29:41,816
enrollments, which means you can

1041
00:29:41,816 --> 0:29:43,626
no longer pass off credentials

1042
00:29:43,626 --> 0:29:45,286
on the command line's fdesetup.

1043
00:29:45,966 --> 0:29:47,006
So, you should review your

1044
00:29:47,006 --> 0:29:48,556
scripts and MDM agents if you

1045
00:29:48,556 --> 0:29:50,196
have one in your MDM product, to

1046
00:29:50,196 --> 0:29:51,456
be prepared for this change.

1047
00:29:51,906 --> 0:29:54,676
Next, I think I heard there's

1048
00:29:54,676 --> 0:29:55,976
been a lot of excitement about

1049
00:29:55,976 --> 0:29:57,426
Activation Lock coming to T2

1050
00:29:57,426 --> 0:29:58,906
Macs and macOS Catalina.

1051
00:29:59,076 --> 0:30:00,096
So, of course, we made this

1052
00:29:59,076 --> 0:30:00,096
So, of course, we made this

1053
00:30:00,096 --> 0:30:02,096
manageable via MDM, just like

1054
00:30:02,096 --> 0:30:02,336
iOS.

1055
00:30:03,156 --> 0:30:05,146
In fact, your MDM servers will

1056
00:30:05,146 --> 0:30:06,966
use the same endpoint in API as

1057
00:30:06,966 --> 0:30:07,216
iOS.

1058
00:30:07,366 --> 0:30:09,846
Those APIs will be available

1059
00:30:09,846 --> 0:30:11,226
soon, and service fully

1060
00:30:11,226 --> 0:30:12,816
available later this summer.

1061
00:30:12,816 --> 0:30:13,976
So, you can test your

1062
00:30:13,976 --> 0:30:15,406
implementation and have it ready

1063
00:30:15,406 --> 0:30:16,516
when that kept a Catalina ships

1064
00:30:16,516 --> 0:30:17,186
later this fall.

1065
00:30:18,516 --> 0:30:20,696
[ Applause ]

1066
00:30:21,196 --> 0:30:24,976
It's a big deal.

1067
00:30:25,186 --> 0:30:26,576
Again, a couple of changes to

1068
00:30:26,576 --> 0:30:27,836
tweak that balance.

1069
00:30:28,056 --> 0:30:29,646
We're deprecating in macOS

1070
00:30:29,646 --> 0:30:31,216
Catalina, although all of these

1071
00:30:31,216 --> 0:30:32,316
capabilities will continue to

1072
00:30:32,316 --> 0:30:34,746
work in Catalina, starting with

1073
00:30:34,746 --> 0:30:36,236
silent profile installation from

1074
00:30:36,236 --> 0:30:37,016
the command line.

1075
00:30:38,316 --> 0:30:39,926
With Screen Time coming to macOS

1076
00:30:39,926 --> 0:30:41,736
and Catalina, we are deprecating

1077
00:30:41,736 --> 0:30:43,386
path-based app black and

1078
00:30:43,386 --> 0:30:44,616
whitelists that are currently

1079
00:30:44,616 --> 0:30:45,906
configured using the parental

1080
00:30:45,906 --> 0:30:47,356
controls application access

1081
00:30:47,406 --> 0:30:47,816
payload.

1082
00:30:48,936 --> 0:30:50,456
And if your MDM server is still

1083
00:30:50,456 --> 0:30:52,286
using the outdated user channel

1084
00:30:52,286 --> 0:30:53,836
only enrollments, you should

1085
00:30:53,836 --> 0:30:54,626
move to the modern

1086
00:30:54,626 --> 0:30:56,126
macOS-specific enrollments that

1087
00:30:56,126 --> 0:30:57,326
are required for user

1088
00:30:57,326 --> 0:30:59,096
enrollments and also will be for

1089
00:30:59,096 --> 0:31:00,686
any future enhancements to macOS

1090
00:30:59,096 --> 0:31:00,686
any future enhancements to macOS

1091
00:31:00,726 --> 0:31:01,596
device management.

1092
00:31:04,456 --> 0:31:05,916
Can we get a finely for the

1093
00:31:05,916 --> 0:31:06,366
slide?

1094
00:31:07,446 --> 0:31:08,336
I've been showing a version of

1095
00:31:08,336 --> 0:31:09,486
this for I don't want to say how

1096
00:31:09,486 --> 0:31:10,846
many years, but this year, in

1097
00:31:11,026 --> 0:31:13,196
iOS 13 we will stop honoring the

1098
00:31:13,376 --> 0:31:14,886
list of restrictions created

1099
00:31:14,886 --> 0:31:16,336
before supervision existed,

1100
00:31:16,536 --> 0:31:17,306
which really should be

1101
00:31:17,306 --> 0:31:20,046
supervised only, but there'll be

1102
00:31:20,046 --> 0:31:21,406
some grandfathering to make the

1103
00:31:21,406 --> 0:31:22,776
transition a bit easier for

1104
00:31:22,776 --> 0:31:24,096
organizations relying on these

1105
00:31:24,096 --> 0:31:24,816
restrictions.

1106
00:31:25,336 --> 0:31:27,486
For unsupervised devices with

1107
00:31:27,486 --> 0:31:28,916
these restrictions enforced on

1108
00:31:28,916 --> 0:31:31,016
iOS 12, when they're upgraded to

1109
00:31:31,146 --> 0:31:32,756
iOS 13, they will remain in

1110
00:31:32,756 --> 0:31:34,656
force, but they will not be

1111
00:31:34,656 --> 0:31:36,236
honored on those unsupervised

1112
00:31:36,236 --> 0:31:37,926
devices if you backup and then

1113
00:31:37,926 --> 0:31:39,366
restore to that device or

1114
00:31:39,366 --> 0:31:40,816
another unsupervised device.

1115
00:31:41,816 --> 0:31:43,746
This means that MDM servers need

1116
00:31:43,746 --> 0:31:44,616
to stop sending these

1117
00:31:44,616 --> 0:31:45,796
restrictions to unsupervised

1118
00:31:45,796 --> 0:31:46,906
devices, because they will no

1119
00:31:46,906 --> 0:31:47,716
longer be honored.

1120
00:31:50,596 --> 0:31:52,146
Bob explained that user

1121
00:31:52,146 --> 0:31:53,246
enrollment does not support the

1122
00:31:53,246 --> 0:31:54,966
unlock token, and we're also

1123
00:31:54,966 --> 0:31:56,276
making some changes device

1124
00:31:56,276 --> 0:31:57,796
enrollment related to it.

1125
00:31:58,236 --> 0:31:59,436
Specifically, though, this is

1126
00:31:59,436 --> 0:32:00,996
not new best practice.

1127
00:31:59,436 --> 0:32:00,996
not new best practice.

1128
00:32:01,036 --> 0:32:02,406
I always advise that you get the

1129
00:32:02,406 --> 0:32:03,696
unlock token as soon as you need

1130
00:32:03,696 --> 0:32:04,476
it and remember it.

1131
00:32:04,476 --> 0:32:06,756
It will now only be available in

1132
00:32:06,756 --> 0:32:07,996
the first successful token

1133
00:32:07,996 --> 0:32:09,106
update after enrollment.

1134
00:32:10,296 --> 0:32:12,036
Similarly, devices which have

1135
00:32:12,036 --> 0:32:13,476
been paired and supervised with

1136
00:32:13,476 --> 0:32:15,506
Apple Configurator, you still

1137
00:32:15,506 --> 0:32:16,876
need to get the unlock token

1138
00:32:16,876 --> 0:32:18,436
before you set a passcode on

1139
00:32:18,436 --> 0:32:19,136
that device.

1140
00:32:19,686 --> 0:32:21,866
So, that brings us to the end of

1141
00:32:21,866 --> 0:32:23,596
our second section of content,

1142
00:32:24,086 --> 0:32:26,146
and I'd like to now turn to some

1143
00:32:26,146 --> 0:32:27,586
new device capabilities that

1144
00:32:27,586 --> 0:32:29,016
allow you to continue using

1145
00:32:29,016 --> 0:32:30,276
services you're already using

1146
00:32:30,276 --> 0:32:31,426

The first one is another really

1151
00:32:36,946 --> 0:32:38,296
big deal that Craig highlighted

1152
00:32:38,296 --> 0:32:40,176
in Monday's keynote, and I'd

1153
00:32:40,176 --> 0:32:41,376

00:33:06,806 --> 0:33:09,066
on premise, and sometimes both.

1171
00:33:10,156 --> 0:33:11,396
Recently though, authentication

1172
00:33:11,396 --> 0:33:12,086
has been getting more

1173
00:33:12,086 --> 0:33:12,796
complicated.

1174
00:33:13,406 --> 0:33:14,406
You have to handle multiple

1175
00:33:14,406 --> 0:33:15,926
authentication protocols such as

1176
00:33:15,926 --> 0:33:19,186
Kerberos, OpenID Connect, and

1177
00:33:20,376 --> 0:33:20,726
SAML.

1178
00:33:20,726 --> 0:33:21,726
You're now federated to the

1179
00:33:21,726 --> 0:33:23,476
cloud, and you need to trust

1180
00:33:23,476 --> 0:33:25,186
your devices and use more than

1181
00:33:25,186 --> 0:33:26,026
just passwords for

1182
00:33:26,026 --> 0:33:26,706
authentication.

1183
00:33:27,446 --> 0:33:29,426
So, how do organizations deal

1184
00:33:29,426 --> 0:33:30,356
with these challenges?

1185
00:33:31,026 --> 0:33:32,306
Well, they use Single Sign-On to

1186
00:33:32,306 --> 0:33:32,546
help.

1187
00:33:33,086 --> 0:33:36,366
When they use Single Sign-On,

1188
00:33:36,366 --> 0:33:37,716
they have a suite of apps and

1189
00:33:37,716 --> 0:33:40,086
websites that they log in once

1190
00:33:40,086 --> 0:33:42,116
too, and is reused across all of

1191
00:33:42,116 --> 0:33:42,206
them.

1192
00:33:43,176 --> 0:33:44,576
Organizations will also use this

1193
00:33:44,576 --> 0:33:46,096
to improve the user experience

1194
00:33:46,096 --> 0:33:48,186
of authentication, avoid the

1195
00:33:48,186 --> 0:33:50,076
user friction of signing in over

1196
00:33:50,076 --> 0:33:50,776
and over again.

1197
00:33:52,146 --> 0:33:53,606
Some organizations just don't

1198
00:33:53,606 --> 0:33:54,436
have passwords.

1199
00:33:55,016 --> 0:33:55,966
So, they have to use Single

1200
00:33:55,966 --> 0:33:57,886
Sign-On to authenticate, and the

1201
00:33:57,886 --> 0:33:59,586
challenge is that not every

1202
00:34:00,076 --> 0:34:01,646
application supports their

1203
00:34:01,806 --> 0:34:03,446
authentication stack.

1204
00:34:05,496 --> 0:34:08,226
And, with all the risks these

1205
00:34:08,226 --> 0:34:10,126
days, you want to supplement

1206
00:34:10,126 --> 0:34:11,436
your authentication processes

1207
00:34:11,436 --> 0:34:12,746
with trust score data and other

1208
00:34:12,746 --> 0:34:13,985
information about the device

1209
00:34:13,985 --> 0:34:15,235
that you're running on.

1210
00:34:16,216 --> 0:34:17,536
So, today I'd like to tell you

1211
00:34:17,536 --> 0:34:18,716
about the powerful new Single

1212
00:34:18,716 --> 0:34:20,146
Sign-On capabilities we added to

1213
00:34:20,146 --> 0:34:22,676
both iOS 13 and macOS Catalina.

1214
00:34:23,755 --> 0:34:25,196
It's enabled by the extensible

1215
00:34:25,196 --> 0:34:27,666
SSO MDM profile, as well as

1216
00:34:27,666 --> 0:34:29,406
associated domains, and it works

1217
00:34:29,406 --> 0:34:30,585
great with user enrollment, as

1218
00:34:30,585 --> 0:34:30,815
well.

1219
00:34:32,065 --> 0:34:33,496
The extension has the option to

1220
00:34:33,496 --> 0:34:37,255
show UI, load a webpage, or just

1221
00:34:37,255 --> 0:34:38,516
handle the request silently.

1222
00:34:39,076 --> 0:34:41,516
We think these changes will help

1223
00:34:41,516 --> 0:34:44,735
you use and create SSO solutions

1224
00:34:45,156 --> 0:34:46,446
that are both secure and

1225
00:34:46,446 --> 0:34:47,076
user-friendly.

1226
00:34:47,676 --> 0:34:49,255
So, in our session today, I will

1227
00:34:49,255 --> 0:34:50,255
provide a summary of Single

1228
00:34:50,255 --> 0:34:51,536
Sign-On and how it works.

1229
00:34:52,206 --> 0:34:53,376
For more detail, look for a

1230
00:34:53,376 --> 0:34:54,565
recorded session after the

1231
00:34:54,636 --> 0:34:55,985
conference with code samples and

1232
00:34:55,985 --> 0:34:56,616
more information.

1233
00:34:57,096 --> 0:35:01,026
Earlier this week, you heard

1234
00:34:57,096 --> 0:35:01,026
Earlier this week, you heard

1235
00:35:01,026 --> 0:35:02,446
about an awesome new feature for

1236
00:35:02,696 --> 0:35:04,246
consumer apps called Sign in

1237
00:35:04,246 --> 0:35:04,766
with Apple.

1238
00:35:05,216 --> 0:35:06,226
This is going to be great for

1239
00:35:06,226 --> 0:35:07,306
consumer apps, but they don't

1240
00:35:07,306 --> 0:35:08,336
support all the complex

1241
00:35:08,336 --> 0:35:09,926
scenarios that are needed for

1242
00:35:10,046 --> 0:35:11,396
enterprise applications.

1243
00:35:12,606 --> 0:35:14,126
So, Single Sign-On is different,

1244
00:35:14,336 --> 0:35:15,656
and it's intended for

1245
00:35:15,656 --> 0:35:17,296
third-party identity providers,

1246
00:35:17,296 --> 0:35:19,396
such as Microsoft, Okta, Ping,

1247
00:35:19,396 --> 0:35:19,946
and others.

1248
00:35:21,396 --> 0:35:22,696
In addition, you should know

1249
00:35:22,696 --> 0:35:24,036
that managed Apple IDs will not

1250
00:35:24,036 --> 0:35:28,276
work with Sign In with Apple.

1251
00:35:28,496 --> 0:35:30,236
Okay, so, in order to make

1252
00:35:30,236 --> 0:35:31,896
Single Sign-On work, you need to

1253
00:35:31,896 --> 0:35:33,546
have a set of apps and websites,

1254
00:35:34,136 --> 0:35:35,386
and you have to have an identity

1255
00:35:35,386 --> 0:35:36,466
provider that they're set up to

1256
00:35:36,466 --> 0:35:36,926
use.

1257
00:35:37,376 --> 0:35:38,686
And then, what glues it together

1258
00:35:38,686 --> 0:35:40,026
will be the new Single Sign-On

1259
00:35:40,026 --> 0:35:40,606
extension.

1260
00:35:41,616 --> 0:35:42,626
So, we'll focus on the Single

1261
00:35:42,626 --> 0:35:43,926
Sign-On extension today.

1262
00:35:43,926 --> 0:35:47,546
All right, so how does it work?

1263
00:35:48,436 --> 0:35:49,406
There are two types of

1264
00:35:49,406 --> 0:35:50,926
extensions, redirect and

1265
00:35:50,926 --> 0:35:51,326
credential.

1266
00:35:52,336 --> 0:35:53,396
So, let's start with redirect

1267
00:35:53,396 --> 0:35:53,856
extensions.

1268
00:35:54,446 --> 0:35:58,086
Redirect extensions are intended

1269
00:35:58,086 --> 0:35:59,486
for modern authentication

1270
00:35:59,486 --> 0:36:00,286
protocols, such as

1271
00:35:59,486 --> 0:36:00,286
protocols, such as

1272
00:36:00,286 --> 0:36:02,356
OpenIDConnect, OAuth 2, or SAML.

1273
00:36:03,286 --> 0:36:04,496
They will run on top of web

1274
00:36:04,496 --> 0:36:05,886
technologies, and they

1275
00:36:05,886 --> 0:36:06,826
frequently are paired with

1276
00:36:06,826 --> 0:36:08,346
Federation to on-premise or

1277
00:36:08,346 --> 0:36:09,276
cloud systems for

1278
00:36:09,276 --> 0:36:10,016
authentication.

1279
00:36:10,666 --> 0:36:14,546
Let's check out an example of

1280
00:36:15,276 --> 0:36:15,606
the flow.

1281
00:36:15,606 --> 0:36:17,816
With Safari, we will route a

1282
00:36:17,816 --> 0:36:19,526
request to the Single Sign-On

1283
00:36:19,526 --> 0:36:20,976
extension instead of loading the

1284
00:36:20,976 --> 0:36:21,676
webpage.

1285
00:36:23,436 --> 0:36:25,066
The extension will receive the

1286
00:36:25,066 --> 0:36:27,306
headers, the body, and the URL

1287
00:36:27,306 --> 0:36:27,996
of the request.

1288
00:36:29,196 --> 0:36:30,596
It's now up to the extension to

1289
00:36:30,596 --> 0:36:31,756
complete the authentication

1290
00:36:31,756 --> 0:36:32,946
process with the identity

1291
00:36:32,946 --> 0:36:33,396
provider.

1292
00:36:34,566 --> 0:36:37,236
And when ready, it will return a

1293
00:36:37,236 --> 0:36:39,396
URL response back to Safari.

1294
00:36:40,846 --> 0:36:41,776
Please take note that this

1295
00:36:41,776 --> 0:36:43,266
response should not be large.

1296
00:36:43,646 --> 0:36:45,666
It's intended for a web form

1297
00:36:45,716 --> 0:36:48,146
post of SAML response or other

1298
00:36:48,146 --> 0:36:49,406
tokens back to the server.

1299
00:36:49,776 --> 0:36:51,126
Don't try to load a giant, 1-meg

1300
00:36:51,126 --> 0:36:51,856
webpage in it.

1301
00:36:56,046 --> 0:36:57,556
So, what can these extensions

1302
00:36:57,556 --> 0:36:57,956
do?

1303
00:36:58,416 --> 0:36:59,566
They can do a lot of things.

1304
00:36:59,756 --> 0:37:01,616
I've listed a few of them here.

1305
00:36:59,756 --> 0:37:01,616
I've listed a few of them here.

1306
00:37:01,906 --> 0:37:02,896
They can choose to present a

1307
00:37:02,896 --> 0:37:04,576
native screen for authentication

1308
00:37:04,646 --> 0:37:06,106
instead of loading the webpage.

1309
00:37:06,906 --> 0:37:07,776
The native screen could ask for

1310
00:37:07,776 --> 0:37:08,906
the username and password if

1311
00:37:08,906 --> 0:37:10,576
that applies, or it can ask for

1312
00:37:10,576 --> 0:37:12,166
additional multi-factors, as

1313
00:37:13,106 --> 0:37:14,986
your requirements dictate.

1314
00:37:15,876 --> 0:37:17,426
If you've generated keys with

1315
00:37:17,426 --> 0:37:19,386
the secure enclave, perhaps they

1316
00:37:19,386 --> 0:37:20,796
can sign attributes and send it

1317
00:37:20,796 --> 0:37:21,886
along with the request to

1318
00:37:21,886 --> 0:37:23,976
strongly pair the device with

1319
00:37:23,976 --> 0:37:25,516
the user, so that you have that

1320
00:37:25,516 --> 0:37:27,636
extra confidence in the request.

1321
00:37:28,856 --> 0:37:30,016
Other trust score values could

1322
00:37:30,016 --> 0:37:31,326
be appended, such as the version

1323
00:37:31,326 --> 0:37:32,386
of the operating system running

1324
00:37:32,386 --> 0:37:33,706
on the device or whatever else

1325
00:37:33,706 --> 0:37:36,086
you need to feel good about it.

1326
00:37:37,186 --> 0:37:39,826
It could simply load a webpage

1327
00:37:39,826 --> 0:37:40,996
and follow the redirects for

1328
00:37:40,996 --> 0:37:42,596
Federation, and that's going to

1329
00:37:42,596 --> 0:37:44,546
be a very common scenario.

1330
00:37:45,756 --> 0:37:47,686
And with the new FIDO2

1331
00:37:47,686 --> 0:37:49,826
capabilities in macOS this year,

1332
00:37:49,826 --> 0:37:51,656
it could use web authentication

1333
00:37:51,656 --> 0:37:52,886
to authenticate the device, as

1334
00:37:52,886 --> 0:37:54,276
well, if your identity provider

1335
00:37:54,276 --> 0:37:55,486
supports it.

1336
00:37:56,296 --> 0:37:57,636
For more information on web

1337
00:37:57,636 --> 0:37:59,286
authentication, see the What's

1338
00:37:59,286 --> 0:38:00,666
New in Authentication session in

1339
00:37:59,286 --> 0:38:00,666
New in Authentication session in

1340
00:38:00,666 --> 0:38:01,606
this year's conference.

1341
00:38:01,996 --> 0:38:05,336
Redirect extensions will also

1342
00:38:05,336 --> 0:38:06,376
work for native apps.

1343
00:38:07,246 --> 0:38:08,626
Native apps have an additional

1344
00:38:08,626 --> 0:38:09,466
capability though.

1345
00:38:09,596 --> 0:38:11,236
They can send operations to the

1346
00:38:11,236 --> 0:38:11,766
extension.

1347
00:38:12,696 --> 0:38:14,656
These operations would be, or

1348
00:38:14,656 --> 0:38:16,746
examples are login, refresh

1349
00:38:16,746 --> 0:38:18,006
tokens, or logout.

1350
00:38:19,366 --> 0:38:20,716
This way, the app developers can

1351
00:38:20,716 --> 0:38:22,486
decide when does authentication

1352
00:38:22,576 --> 0:38:23,736
fit within the flow of my

1353
00:38:23,736 --> 0:38:24,426
application?

1354
00:38:25,036 --> 0:38:26,576
And hopefully, the extension

1355
00:38:26,576 --> 0:38:27,756
will accommodate that.

1356
00:38:28,266 --> 0:38:30,166
And for the enterprise

1357
00:38:30,166 --> 0:38:31,896
developers in the audience, this

1358
00:38:31,896 --> 0:38:33,086
means you can effectively use

1359
00:38:33,086 --> 0:38:34,886
the extension as your identity

1360
00:38:34,886 --> 0:38:36,316
library or authentication

1361
00:38:36,316 --> 0:38:36,736
library.

1362
00:38:37,946 --> 0:38:39,376
It avoids the need to include a

1363
00:38:39,376 --> 0:38:40,886
copy of the library in every app

1364
00:38:40,886 --> 0:38:42,036
that you have and then

1365
00:38:42,036 --> 0:38:43,356
subsequently maintaining it over

1366
00:38:43,356 --> 0:38:43,716
time.

1367
00:38:46,031 --> 0:38:48,031
[ Applause ]

1368
00:38:48,046 --> 0:38:48,526
It'll be great.

1369
00:38:51,476 --> 0:38:52,696
So, let's check out the flow for

1370
00:38:52,696 --> 0:38:53,706
native app.

1371
00:38:54,976 --> 0:38:57,126
The native app will send the

1372
00:38:57,126 --> 0:38:58,646
operation to the extension

1373
00:38:58,646 --> 0:39:00,246
instead of the URL request.

1374
00:38:58,646 --> 0:39:00,246
instead of the URL request.

1375
00:39:00,246 --> 0:39:01,656
In this example, it's login.

1376
00:39:02,096 --> 0:39:04,336
The extension is still

1377
00:39:04,336 --> 0:39:05,506
responsible for completing the

1378
00:39:05,506 --> 0:39:07,026
authentication process with the

1379
00:39:07,026 --> 0:39:09,416
identity provider, and when

1380
00:39:09,416 --> 0:39:10,656
ready, it will return the URL

1381
00:39:10,656 --> 0:39:11,986
response, but really, most

1382
00:39:11,986 --> 0:39:13,246
importantly, the tokens that are

1383
00:39:13,246 --> 0:39:14,636
needed by that application that

1384
00:39:14,636 --> 0:39:16,136
they requested, in order to

1385
00:39:16,376 --> 0:39:17,676
process and work correctly,

1386
00:39:18,116 --> 0:39:19,426
think ID tokens and access

1387
00:39:19,456 --> 0:39:20,856
tokens for consuming other

1388
00:39:20,856 --> 0:39:21,326
services.

1389
00:39:21,806 --> 0:39:24,906
Now that we know what it does,

1390
00:39:25,146 --> 0:39:26,426
let's talk about what we need to

1391
00:39:26,426 --> 0:39:27,236
do to make it work.

1392
00:39:27,916 --> 0:39:31,706
It is enabled by the extensible

1393
00:39:31,706 --> 0:39:34,586
SSO profile in iOS 13 and macOS

1394
00:39:34,586 --> 0:39:35,106
Catalina.

1395
00:39:36,616 --> 0:39:37,606
Check out the example here.

1396
00:39:37,606 --> 0:39:39,156
The identifier is

1397
00:39:39,156 --> 0:39:41,376
com.apple.extensiblesso.

1398
00:39:41,976 --> 0:39:45,456
It specifies the specific

1399
00:39:45,456 --> 0:39:46,776
extension that you want to use

1400
00:39:46,776 --> 0:39:48,046
in your environment, including

1401
00:39:48,046 --> 0:39:48,996
the team identifier.

1402
00:39:50,456 --> 0:39:52,696
It lists the type, in this case,

1403
00:39:52,696 --> 0:39:56,756
redirect, as well as the list of

1404
00:39:56,756 --> 0:39:59,136
URLs that will be redirected to

1405
00:39:59,136 --> 0:39:59,576
the extension.

1406
00:40:03,156 --> 0:40:04,946
And finally, an optional

1407
00:40:04,946 --> 0:40:07,216
dictionary of extension-specific

1408
00:40:07,216 --> 0:40:08,156
values from the MDM.

1409
00:40:08,156 --> 0:40:10,146
In this example, I'm sending a

1410
00:40:10,146 --> 0:40:11,226
user name, but you can put

1411
00:40:11,226 --> 0:40:12,186
whatever you need in there.

1412
00:40:15,876 --> 0:40:17,496
The second requirement is to use

1413
00:40:17,496 --> 0:40:18,656
associated domains.

1414
00:40:19,316 --> 0:40:20,856
You're required to use

1415
00:40:20,856 --> 0:40:22,086
associated domains because you

1416
00:40:22,086 --> 0:40:23,406
can't just redirect any

1417
00:40:23,406 --> 0:40:24,726
authentication traffic on the

1418
00:40:24,726 --> 0:40:25,836
device to your extension.

1419
00:40:26,756 --> 0:40:29,266
You can only redirect traffic

1420
00:40:29,266 --> 0:40:30,936
that is owned by you or your

1421
00:40:30,936 --> 0:40:31,786
identity provider.

1422
00:40:33,796 --> 0:40:34,846
So, in order to set up

1423
00:40:34,846 --> 0:40:36,806
associated domains, you need to

1424
00:40:36,806 --> 0:40:38,866
use the offserve service type,

1425
00:40:39,176 --> 0:40:40,526
followed by a colon, and then,

1426
00:40:40,526 --> 0:40:41,996
each of the host names in the

1427
00:40:41,996 --> 0:40:42,936
URL list that we saw in the

1428
00:40:42,936 --> 0:40:43,646
previous slides.

1429
00:40:43,646 --> 0:40:47,626
If your app has multiple hosts,

1430
00:40:47,816 --> 0:40:49,096
then you need to list each one

1431
00:40:49,096 --> 0:40:50,446
separately in the file.

1432
00:40:53,156 --> 0:40:54,976
Associated Domains also requires

1433
00:40:54,976 --> 0:40:57,476
that the host app ID is in the

1434
00:40:57,476 --> 0:40:59,356
Apple app site association file

1435
00:40:59,356 --> 0:41:00,786
that on the destination server.

1436
00:40:59,356 --> 0:41:00,786
that on the destination server.

1437
00:41:01,416 --> 0:41:03,676
The server must be accessible by

1438
00:41:03,676 --> 0:41:05,596
the device and have a valid SSL

1439
00:41:05,596 --> 0:41:05,966
cert.

1440
00:41:07,046 --> 0:41:08,396
User-approved or custom root

1441
00:41:08,396 --> 0:41:09,796
certificates are not supported.

1442
00:41:12,076 --> 0:41:14,096
However, in some cases, the

1443
00:41:14,096 --> 0:41:15,886
associated domains are not known

1444
00:41:15,886 --> 0:41:16,816
at the time the app is

1445
00:41:16,816 --> 0:41:17,306
developed.

1446
00:41:18,146 --> 0:41:20,076
A great example of this is when

1447
00:41:20,076 --> 0:41:21,706
an identity provider develops an

1448
00:41:21,706 --> 0:41:25,626
extension, but each customer's

1449
00:41:25,626 --> 0:41:26,666
hostname is different.

1450
00:41:26,996 --> 0:41:28,046
They can't list thousands of

1451
00:41:28,046 --> 0:41:29,256
them in an entitlement file.

1452
00:41:29,256 --> 0:41:30,176
It just won't happen.

1453
00:41:30,806 --> 0:41:32,166
When this occurs, we can use the

1454
00:41:32,166 --> 0:41:33,786
new Manage Associated Domains

1455
00:41:33,826 --> 0:41:35,376
profile on macOS.

1456
00:41:35,926 --> 0:41:39,396
In the example here, note that

1457
00:41:39,396 --> 0:41:41,956
the payload value is the same as

1458
00:41:41,956 --> 0:41:42,756
what would've been in the

1459
00:41:42,756 --> 0:41:45,216
entitlement file that was on the

1460
00:41:45,766 --> 0:41:48,156
app that was developed.

1461
00:41:48,156 --> 0:41:49,546
On iOS, you can use a new

1462
00:41:49,546 --> 0:41:51,276
associated domains application

1463
00:41:51,276 --> 0:41:53,906
attribute, and again, note that

1464
00:41:53,906 --> 0:41:56,696
the value of the attribute is

1465
00:41:56,696 --> 0:41:57,596
the same as what would've been

1466
00:41:57,596 --> 0:41:58,836
in the entitlements file in the

1467
00:41:58,906 --> 0:42:00,616
host app that would happen.

1468
00:41:58,906 --> 0:42:00,616
host app that would happen.

1469
00:42:01,206 --> 0:42:03,896
The last step for using managed

1470
00:42:03,896 --> 0:42:06,176
associated domains is to include

1471
00:42:06,176 --> 0:42:07,946
the managed associated domain's

1472
00:42:08,706 --> 0:42:10,556
entitlement in the host apps

1473
00:42:10,556 --> 0:42:10,946
file.

1474
00:42:11,106 --> 0:42:12,256
This lets us know that you want

1475
00:42:12,256 --> 0:42:13,566
to use the managed values, in

1476
00:42:13,566 --> 0:42:14,566
addition to what you already

1477
00:42:14,566 --> 0:42:15,966
have inside the entitlement

1478
00:42:15,966 --> 0:42:16,306
file.

1479
00:42:17,606 --> 0:42:18,936
The associated domain's array

1480
00:42:18,936 --> 0:42:21,466
has to be present and not empty,

1481
00:42:22,466 --> 0:42:23,546
and you can even have other

1482
00:42:23,546 --> 0:42:24,866
values in there already, and we

1483
00:42:24,866 --> 0:42:26,936
will pin the ones from the MDM

1484
00:42:26,936 --> 0:42:28,426
into the list there for you to

1485
00:42:28,426 --> 0:42:29,506
use.

1486
00:42:30,276 --> 0:42:31,866
For more details on associated

1487
00:42:31,866 --> 0:42:33,996
domains, how to use them, check

1488
00:42:33,996 --> 0:42:35,306
out the What's New in Universal

1489
00:42:35,306 --> 0:42:36,406
Links session in this year's

1490
00:42:36,406 --> 0:42:36,956
conference.

1491
00:42:41,216 --> 0:42:42,146
All right, and that completes

1492
00:42:42,146 --> 0:42:43,246
redirect extensions.

1493
00:42:44,366 --> 0:42:45,096
So, now let's shift to

1494
00:42:45,096 --> 0:42:46,276
credential extensions.

1495
00:42:48,936 --> 0:42:50,346
Credential extensions are

1496
00:42:50,346 --> 0:42:50,876
intended for

1497
00:42:50,876 --> 0:42:52,486
challenge-response-type

1498
00:42:52,486 --> 0:42:53,896
authentication flows, and a

1499
00:42:53,896 --> 0:42:54,926
great example of this is

1500
00:42:54,926 --> 0:42:55,566
Kerberos.

1501
00:42:56,876 --> 0:42:58,296
These flows are different than

1502
00:42:58,296 --> 0:43:00,176
redirects, because the client

1503
00:42:58,296 --> 0:43:00,176
redirects, because the client

1504
00:43:00,176 --> 0:43:01,606
will request the data and then

1505
00:43:01,606 --> 0:43:02,566
they are challenged for

1506
00:43:02,566 --> 0:43:03,326
authentication.

1507
00:43:04,446 --> 0:43:07,286
Whereas redirect extensions, the

1508
00:43:07,286 --> 0:43:08,906
client will proactively go out

1509
00:43:08,906 --> 0:43:10,496
and retrieve tokens before

1510
00:43:10,496 --> 0:43:12,296
they're needed and then use

1511
00:43:12,296 --> 0:43:12,466
them.

1512
00:43:14,056 --> 0:43:15,136
We also support custom

1513
00:43:15,136 --> 0:43:16,626
authentication challenges for

1514
00:43:17,366 --> 0:43:17,486
this.

1515
00:43:19,296 --> 0:43:20,836
Credential extensions are

1516
00:43:20,836 --> 0:43:21,696
different in redirect

1517
00:43:21,696 --> 0:43:23,446
extensions, in that they receive

1518
00:43:23,446 --> 0:43:24,756
HTTP challenge from the

1519
00:43:24,756 --> 0:43:25,936
operating system and not the

1520
00:43:25,936 --> 0:43:26,506
request.

1521
00:43:27,466 --> 0:43:29,156
The challenge will include the

1522
00:43:29,156 --> 0:43:30,586
URL and the headers that were

1523
00:43:30,586 --> 0:43:31,116
returned.

1524
00:43:31,616 --> 0:43:34,136
The MDM profile will contain a

1525
00:43:34,136 --> 0:43:36,896
list of hosts or host suffixes

1526
00:43:37,476 --> 0:43:38,936
that applies to that extension.

1527
00:43:40,136 --> 0:43:41,176
So, for example, if you have

1528
00:43:41,266 --> 0:43:43,246
.example.com, it'll be treated

1529
00:43:43,246 --> 0:43:44,736
as a suffix.

1530
00:43:45,726 --> 0:43:47,606
Operations are also supported

1531
00:43:47,606 --> 0:43:49,286
for credential-mode extensions,

1532
00:43:50,356 --> 0:43:51,756
and there's not an associated

1533
00:43:51,756 --> 0:43:55,576
domain requirement for them.

1534
00:43:55,766 --> 0:43:56,696
Okay, so let's check out the

1535
00:43:56,696 --> 0:43:57,036
flow.

1536
00:43:58,436 --> 0:43:59,986
In Safari, or your native app,

1537
00:43:59,986 --> 0:44:01,116
it'll make a request to a

1538
00:43:59,986 --> 0:44:01,116
it'll make a request to a

1539
00:44:01,116 --> 0:44:01,586
server.

1540
00:44:02,756 --> 0:44:04,216
The server will return an

1541
00:44:04,216 --> 0:44:06,676
authentication challenge back to

1542
00:44:06,676 --> 0:44:07,796
the operating system, which we

1543
00:44:07,796 --> 0:44:08,946
will route to the extension.

1544
00:44:10,006 --> 0:44:11,346
Just like the other extensions,

1545
00:44:11,346 --> 0:44:14,126
it is required that it completes

1546
00:44:14,126 --> 0:44:15,516
the authentication process with

1547
00:44:15,516 --> 0:44:17,166
the identity provider or the

1548
00:44:17,166 --> 0:44:18,726
authentication servers, whatever

1549
00:44:18,726 --> 0:44:20,726
it may be.

1550
00:44:20,966 --> 0:44:22,546
And when ready, the extension

1551
00:44:22,546 --> 0:44:25,416
will return the headers back to

1552
00:44:25,416 --> 0:44:26,496
the operating system, which will

1553
00:44:26,496 --> 0:44:27,936
get sent back to the server, and

1554
00:44:28,436 --> 0:44:29,916
assuming the server accepts it,

1555
00:44:30,086 --> 0:44:31,236
the data will be returned back

1556
00:44:31,236 --> 0:44:33,026
to the calling app that's

1557
00:44:33,026 --> 0:44:33,336
needed.

1558
00:44:33,606 --> 0:44:36,356
And that's the flow for

1559
00:44:36,356 --> 0:44:37,466
credential extensions.

1560
00:44:37,946 --> 0:44:39,516
And now for a demo of credential

1561
00:44:39,516 --> 0:44:40,556
mode extensions, I'd like to

1562
00:44:40,556 --> 0:44:42,016
call my colleague, Rick Lemmon.

1563
00:44:42,256 --> 0:44:42,486
Rick?

1565
00:44:48,266 --> 0:44:49,406
&gt;&gt; Hey, thanks a lot, Matt.

1566
00:44:49,906 --> 0:44:51,306
Hi everybody, my name's Rick

1567
00:44:51,306 --> 0:44:52,616
Lemmon, and I'm an engineer on

1568
00:44:52,616 --> 0:44:53,866
the Apple Professional Services

1569
00:44:53,866 --> 0:44:54,026
Team.

1570
00:44:55,076 --> 0:44:56,386
Today, I'd like to demonstrate a

1571
00:44:56,386 --> 0:44:57,726
credential mode extension to you

1572
00:44:58,536 --> 0:44:59,136
that we've built.

1573
00:44:59,776 --> 0:45:01,246
This extension makes it easy for

1574
00:44:59,776 --> 0:45:01,246
This extension makes it easy for

1575
00:45:01,246 --> 0:45:02,886
users to use Single Sign-On with

1576
00:45:02,886 --> 0:45:04,086
your apps and websites.

1577
00:45:04,896 --> 0:45:06,046
If you develop a Single Sign-On

1578
00:45:06,046 --> 0:45:08,056
extension, you'll probably

1579
00:45:08,056 --> 0:45:09,436
deliver it to your users as part

1580
00:45:09,436 --> 0:45:10,506
of an app.

1581
00:45:10,506 --> 0:45:12,256
So, this app can be used to

1582
00:45:12,256 --> 0:45:13,836
deliver functionality that might

1583
00:45:13,836 --> 0:45:14,936
not make sense to deliver in

1584
00:45:14,936 --> 0:45:17,456
your extension, such as

1585
00:45:17,456 --> 0:45:18,986
displaying status information to

1586
00:45:18,986 --> 0:45:20,486
the user or allowing them to

1587
00:45:20,486 --> 0:45:21,656
change their password.

1588
00:45:22,276 --> 0:45:24,036
In our extension, what we've

1589
00:45:24,036 --> 0:45:25,676
done is use a menu extra to do

1590
00:45:25,676 --> 0:45:25,846
this.

1591
00:45:25,846 --> 0:45:26,876
So, that's a little great key

1592
00:45:26,876 --> 0:45:27,676
that we see up here.

1593
00:45:28,536 --> 0:45:30,136
So, what I'd like to do now is

1594
00:45:30,136 --> 0:45:31,286
go ahead and sign into the

1595
00:45:31,286 --> 0:45:31,686
extension.

1596
00:45:32,696 --> 0:45:33,966
Let's go ahead and sign in.

1597
00:45:34,556 --> 0:45:36,186
I'm going to go ahead and enter

1598
00:45:36,186 --> 0:45:37,216
my username and password.

1599
00:45:43,056 --> 0:45:45,206
And click sign in.

1600
00:45:45,586 --> 0:45:47,276
Great. Now we're signed in.

1601
00:45:47,666 --> 0:45:48,926
So, let's go back and look at

1602
00:45:48,926 --> 0:45:49,576
the menu extra.

1603
00:45:51,166 --> 0:45:52,516
You'll notice in the menu extra,

1604
00:45:52,516 --> 0:45:53,786
we're now displaying some useful

1605
00:45:53,786 --> 0:45:55,156
status information to the user,

1606
00:45:55,906 --> 0:45:57,056
like the user that we're signed

1607
00:45:57,056 --> 0:45:58,396
in as and when our password

1608
00:45:58,396 --> 0:45:58,956
expires.

1609
00:45:59,396 --> 0:46:00,706
We also exposed some useful

1610
00:45:59,396 --> 0:46:00,706
We also exposed some useful

1611
00:46:00,706 --> 0:46:01,996
functionality, like the ability

1612
00:46:01,996 --> 0:46:03,336
to change your password and sign

1613
00:46:03,336 --> 0:46:03,526
out.

1614
00:46:04,946 --> 0:46:06,466
But now that we're signed into

1615
00:46:06,466 --> 0:46:08,136
the Single Sign-On extension, we

1616
00:46:08,136 --> 0:46:09,746
can use Single Sign-On to access

1617
00:46:09,746 --> 0:46:10,786
websites and apps.

1618
00:46:10,966 --> 0:46:12,176
So, let's go ahead and try a

1619
00:46:12,176 --> 0:46:13,516
sample website that we've built.

1620
00:46:14,456 --> 0:46:16,616
Let's go ahead and, well, load

1621
00:46:16,616 --> 0:46:17,416
the sample website.

1622
00:46:17,416 --> 0:46:20,246
And, excellent.

1623
00:46:20,736 --> 0:46:21,766
You've seen that we've just used

1624
00:46:21,766 --> 0:46:23,046
Single Sign-On to access this

1625
00:46:23,046 --> 0:46:24,116
website, and you'll notice, I

1626
00:46:24,116 --> 0:46:25,506
wasn't prompted to authenticate.

1627
00:46:25,986 --> 0:46:26,936
We can see that I'm

1628
00:46:26,936 --> 0:46:28,456
authenticated as the same user

1629
00:46:28,456 --> 0:46:30,896
that I used to sign into the

1630
00:46:30,896 --> 0:46:31,656
extension earlier.

1631
00:46:32,766 --> 0:46:35,136
Let's go ahead and quit Safari,

1632
00:46:35,626 --> 0:46:36,626
and let's show you how this

1633
00:46:36,626 --> 0:46:37,936
works from an app.

1634
00:46:38,096 --> 0:46:39,626
I'm going to go ahead and launch

1635
00:46:39,626 --> 0:46:40,956
an app called Image Retriever

1636
00:46:40,956 --> 0:46:41,986
that we wrote for this demo.

1637
00:46:42,556 --> 0:46:43,756
This app is really simple.

1638
00:46:44,346 --> 0:46:46,036
All that it does is connect to a

1639
00:46:46,036 --> 0:46:47,376
web server that typically

1640
00:46:47,376 --> 0:46:48,566
requires authentication,

1641
00:46:48,846 --> 0:46:50,696
download an image, and displays

1642
00:46:50,696 --> 0:46:51,096
it.

1643
00:46:52,236 --> 0:46:54,466
Now normally, you'd have to

1644
00:46:54,466 --> 0:46:55,366
implement some sort of

1645
00:46:55,366 --> 0:46:56,656
authentication for this app to

1646
00:46:56,656 --> 0:46:57,986
work, but since we have Single

1647
00:46:57,986 --> 0:46:59,086
Sign-On and in place, we don't

1648
00:46:59,086 --> 0:46:59,236
need to.

1649
00:46:59,236 --> 0:46:59,776
Let me go ahead and click

1650
00:46:59,776 --> 0:46:59,976
display.

1651
00:47:03,326 --> 0:47:03,756
Excellent.

1652
00:47:04,166 --> 0:47:05,556
As you might guess, based on my

1653
00:47:05,556 --> 0:47:06,876
last name, I have something of a

1654
00:47:06,876 --> 0:47:07,846
soft spot for lemons.

1655
00:47:07,846 --> 0:47:09,316
So, our app has gone out,

1656
00:47:09,386 --> 0:47:10,656
connected to a web server,

1657
00:47:10,916 --> 0:47:12,256
authenticated using our Single

1658
00:47:12,256 --> 0:47:13,586

1659
00:47:13,586 --> 0:47:14,706

1665
00:47:24,366 --> 0:47:25,516
now, and I'm going to show you

1666
00:47:25,516 --> 0:47:26,826
guys some ways that

1667
00:47:26,826 --> 0:47:28,306
authentication to the extension

1668
00:47:28,306 --> 0:47:28,966
can be triggered.

1669
00:47:30,026 --> 0:47:31,456
To do that, I'll need to sign

1670
00:47:31,456 --> 0:47:32,616
out of the extension, which I'll

1671
00:47:32,616 --> 0:47:33,866
do here in the menu extra.

1672
00:47:33,866 --> 0:47:36,506
Now just a note, your users, if

1673
00:47:36,506 --> 0:47:38,366
you make an extension, will need

1674
00:47:38,366 --> 0:47:40,316
to sign out of the extension.

1675
00:47:40,316 --> 0:47:41,676
We're just doing this purely for

1676
00:47:41,676 --> 0:47:42,776
demonstration purposes.

1677
00:47:43,586 --> 0:47:45,836
So, now that I signed out, let's

1678
00:47:45,836 --> 0:47:47,136
go ahead and launch Safari.

1679
00:47:48,716 --> 0:47:49,826
I'll go ahead and click on our

1680
00:47:49,826 --> 0:47:50,336
website.

1681
00:47:51,266 --> 0:47:52,626
You'll notice I was immediately

1682
00:47:52,626 --> 0:47:54,006
prompted to authenticate, which

1683
00:47:54,006 --> 0:47:54,766
I'll go ahead and do.

1684
00:47:59,446 --> 0:48:00,746
And we'll click sign in.

1685
00:47:59,446 --> 0:48:00,746
And we'll click sign in.

1686
00:48:02,126 --> 0:48:02,526
Excellent.

1687
00:48:02,926 --> 0:48:03,996
You'll notice that as soon as I

1688
00:48:03,996 --> 0:48:05,486
signed in, Safari was able to

1689
00:48:05,486 --> 0:48:06,916
seamlessly authenticate and load

1690
00:48:06,916 --> 0:48:07,496
my website.

1691
00:48:07,926 --> 0:48:09,186
So, I'll go ahead and quit

to make the image load.

again.

1700
00:48:26,396 --> 0:48:27,026

what?

1712

Well, we agree with you.

1715
00:48:50,706 --> 0:48:51,966
One thing that we haven't told

1716
00:48:51,966 --> 0:48:53,436
you yet is that this extension,

1717
00:48:53,436 --> 0:48:54,706
behind the scenes, is using

1718
00:48:54,706 --> 0:48:56,246
Kerberos and Active Directory.

1719
00:48:57,386 --> 0:48:58,956

Thank you.

1726
00:49:14,156 --> 0:49:15,776
This extension is based on

1727
00:49:15,776 --> 0:49:17,376
Enterprise Connect, an Active

1728
00:49:17,376 --> 0:49:18,846
Directory integration solution

that some of you may already be

1730
00:49:20,176 --> 0:49:20,466
using.

1731
00:49:20,766 --> 0:49:22,496
It provides an easy way to

1732
00:49:22,496 --> 0:49:23,576
integrate your devices with

00:49:25,336 --> 0:49:26,716
On top of providing Kerberos

1735
00:49:26,716 --> 0:49:28,316
support, it helps you manage

1736
00:49:28,316 --> 0:49:30,046
your Active Directory password,

1737
00:49:30,276 --> 0:49:32,076
and on macOS, helps you keep

00:49:40,836 --> 0:49:42,756
identity, or on macOS, you can

1745
00:49:42,756 --> 0:49:43,496
use a smart card.

1746
00:49:44,286 --> 0:49:45,356
We think this extension will

1747
00:49:45,356 --> 0:49:47,026
help many of you more easily use

1748
00:49:47,056 --> 0:49:48,476
Kerberos and Active Directory in

1749
00:49:48,476 --> 0:49:49,486
your organizations.

1750
00:49:49,486 --> 0:49:52,636
And that concludes

1751
00:49:52,636 --> 0:49:53,766
credential-based Single Sign-On

1752
00:49:53,766 --> 0:49:54,386
extensions.

1753
00:49:55,866 --> 0:49:57,376
So, let's summarize.

1754
00:49:57,946 --> 0:49:59,196
We're really looking forward to

1755
00:49:59,196 --> 0:50:00,446
seeing what kind of extensions

1756
00:49:59,196 --> 0:50:00,446
seeing what kind of extensions

1757
00:50:00,446 --> 0:50:02,236
you built, out the Single

1758
00:50:02,236 --> 0:50:03,996
Sign-On session for additional

1759
00:50:03,996 --> 0:50:05,206
detail on making your own

1760
00:50:05,206 --> 0:50:05,786
extensions.

1761
00:50:05,886 --> 0:50:07,926
It will be posted to the WWDC

1762
00:50:07,926 --> 0:50:09,396
site after the conference, and

1763
00:50:09,396 --> 0:50:10,436
now I'll hand it back to Todd.

[ Applause ]

1765
00:50:18,066 --> 0:50:19,626
Thank you very much, Matt and

1766
00:50:19,656 --> 0:50:19,766
Rick.

1767
00:50:19,766 --> 0:50:20,836
Just have a few more words about

1768
00:50:20,836 --> 0:50:22,696
associated domains, which, as

1769
00:50:22,696 --> 0:50:24,426
Matt explained, can be managed

1770
00:50:24,426 --> 0:50:25,986
via MDM, but they're not just

1771
00:50:25,986 --> 0:50:26,956
for Single Sign On.

1772
00:50:27,726 --> 0:50:30,006
Other service types, such as

1773
00:50:30,246 --> 0:50:31,906
universal links and password

1774
00:50:31,906 --> 0:50:33,556
autofill, are also supported by

1775
00:50:33,556 --> 0:50:35,796
associated domains, and they're

1776
00:50:35,796 --> 0:50:37,436
now also supported by custom

1777
00:50:37,566 --> 0:50:39,246
apps, not just App Store apps.

1778
00:50:39,976 --> 0:50:41,196
So again, if you'd like to learn

1779
00:50:41,196 --> 0:50:42,626
more about them, check out the

1780
00:50:42,626 --> 0:50:43,866
Universal Links session from

1781
00:50:43,866 --> 0:50:44,656
earlier this week.

1782
00:50:45,266 --> 0:50:47,836
Now I mentioned federated

1783
00:50:47,836 --> 0:50:49,086
authentication earlier in the

1784
00:50:49,086 --> 0:50:50,246
session, but I wanted to

1785
00:50:50,246 --> 0:50:51,636
highlight it here again, because

1786
00:50:51,836 --> 0:50:53,156
it, along with a number of the

1787
00:50:53,156 --> 0:50:54,296
other things we've announced

1788
00:50:54,376 --> 0:50:56,516
here this morning, come together

1789
00:50:56,516 --> 0:50:57,946
is a great example of how we

1790
00:50:57,946 --> 0:50:59,776
enable Apple devices to fit in

1791
00:50:59,776 --> 0:51:00,826
while standing out in your

1792
00:50:59,776 --> 0:51:00,826
while standing out in your

1793
00:51:00,826 --> 0:51:01,536
organization.

1794
00:51:03,676 --> 0:51:05,906
Managed Apple IDs coming to ABM

1795
00:51:06,106 --> 0:51:07,726
and User Enrollment requiring

1796
00:51:07,726 --> 0:51:10,506
Managed Apple ID means that

1797
00:51:10,506 --> 0:51:11,736
we've made it really easy for

1798
00:51:11,736 --> 0:51:13,016
you to take advantage of user

1799
00:51:13,016 --> 0:51:14,306
enrollment with the identities

1800
00:51:14,306 --> 0:51:15,486
that you're already using.

1801
00:51:17,456 --> 0:51:19,136
Now we've spent a lot of time

1802
00:51:19,136 --> 0:51:20,476
today talking about the new, hot

1803
00:51:20,656 --> 0:51:21,696
user enrollment, and that's

1804
00:51:21,696 --> 0:51:22,986
great, but of course, we haven't

1805
00:51:22,986 --> 0:51:24,306
stopped improving device

1806
00:51:24,306 --> 0:51:25,156
enrollment either.

1807
00:51:26,106 --> 0:51:27,376
So, I want to talk about a great

1808
00:51:27,376 --> 0:51:28,406
new feature that allows

1809
00:51:28,406 --> 0:51:30,066
organizations to customize the

1810
00:51:30,066 --> 0:51:31,656
experience their users have

1811
00:51:31,656 --> 0:51:33,096
right inside of Setup Assistant

1812
00:51:33,096 --> 0:51:33,886
as they're enrolling their

1813
00:51:33,886 --> 0:51:34,276
devices.

1814
00:51:34,276 --> 0:51:35,976
This is great.

[ Applause ]

00:51:39,176 --> 0:51:40,726
You can now provide your own

1817
00:51:40,726 --> 0:51:42,596
custom web UI that you can use

1818
00:51:42,596 --> 0:51:43,806
for a number of important

1819
00:51:43,806 --> 0:51:45,996
purposes from choosing the

1820
00:51:45,996 --> 0:51:47,206
authentication type you want to

1821
00:51:47,206 --> 0:51:48,216
use, something modern,

1822
00:51:48,216 --> 0:51:49,726
multifactor, whatever works for

1823
00:51:49,726 --> 0:51:51,576
your organization, custom

1824
00:51:51,576 --> 0:51:53,686
organization branding, and

1825
00:51:53,686 --> 0:51:55,066
whatever additional information

1826
00:51:55,066 --> 0:51:57,246
you want users to have access to

1827
00:51:57,476 --> 0:51:58,846
while they're enrolling, again,

1828
00:51:58,846 --> 0:52:00,166
right in Setup Assistant,

1829
00:51:58,846 --> 0:52:00,166
right in Setup Assistant,

whether it's your privacy

1831
00:52:01,266 --> 0:52:03,846
policy, additional consent text,

1832
00:52:03,846 --> 0:52:05,476
or your acceptable use policy.

1833
00:52:06,046 --> 0:52:07,196
And just to give you an idea,

1834
00:52:07,196 --> 0:52:08,186
again, this should look very

1835
00:52:08,186 --> 0:52:10,736
familiar, but instead of seeing

1836
00:52:10,736 --> 0:52:13,016
our off UI on the next pane in

1837
00:52:13,016 --> 0:52:14,706
Setup Assistant, you can see

1838
00:52:14,706 --> 0:52:15,496
your UI.

1839
00:52:16,556 --> 0:52:18,146
Here's an example on the Mac of

1840
00:52:18,146 --> 0:52:19,056
authentication.

1841
00:52:20,116 --> 0:52:21,116
This is really exciting.

1842
00:52:23,726 --> 0:52:25,676
And in the iPhone, an example,

1843
00:52:25,676 --> 0:52:26,876
Acceptable Use Policy.

1844
00:52:26,946 --> 0:52:28,496
Basically, this just gives you a

1845
00:52:28,496 --> 0:52:30,806
way to give your users the exact

1846
00:52:30,806 --> 0:52:32,346
right experience for them in

1847
00:52:32,346 --> 0:52:33,476

1848
00:52:35,836 --> 0:52:37,296
I mentioned content caching

1849
00:52:37,296 --> 0:52:37,856
earlier.

1850
00:52:37,856 --> 0:52:39,356
This is a great way to optimize

1851
00:52:39,356 --> 0:52:40,746
how your organization uses its

1852
00:52:40,786 --> 0:52:43,766
bandwidth, and to date, it's

1853
00:52:43,856 --> 0:52:45,856
been a best-effort optimization.

1854
00:52:46,126 --> 0:52:47,446
But now it's possible to

1855
00:52:47,446 --> 0:52:48,716
configure it, as required

on your network, if that's what

1858
00:52:51,616 --> 0:52:52,906
works for your organization.

1859
00:52:53,576 --> 0:52:54,806
And you can also configure

1860
00:52:54,806 --> 0:52:56,846
devices to prefer specific

Now, of course, there's lots of

1864
00:53:01,626 --> 0:53:02,546
other things we've added this

settings and restrictions, and

1869
00:53:08,396 --> 0:53:09,716
that's really great, but I think

1870
00:53:09,716 --> 0:53:10,656
we should really read the

1871
00:53:10,656 --> 0:53:12,176
documentation together instead

1872
00:53:12,176 --> 0:53:15,136
of hearing me talk about it.

1873
00:53:15,136 --> 0:53:17,096
Because we are so excited about

1874
00:53:17,186 --> 0:53:18,716
the giant leap forward we made

1875
00:53:18,716 --> 0:53:20,186
in giving you what you deserve,

1876
00:53:20,186 --> 0:53:21,776
comprehensive, up-to-date

1877
00:53:21,776 --> 0:53:24,256
documentation, both because

1878
00:53:24,256 --> 0:53:25,276
we've improved our internal

1879
00:53:25,276 --> 0:53:27,756
processes, allowing us to import

1880
00:53:27,756 --> 0:53:29,566
our new keys and values that we

1881
00:53:29,566 --> 0:53:31,506
add to the profile payloads and

1882
00:53:31,506 --> 0:53:33,196
MDM commands directly from our

1883
00:53:33,196 --> 0:53:35,526
code into the documentation, and

1884
00:53:35,526 --> 0:53:36,796
then showing that documentation

1885
00:53:36,796 --> 0:53:38,476
to you just like all other Apple

release.

1890

00:53:45,856 --> 0:53:47,046
easier for you to adopt

00:53:47,046 --> 0:53:48,066
everything we've talked about

1893
00:53:48,066 --> 0:53:49,686
today and in the future more

customers to take advantage of.

1896

But instead of me talking about

1897
00:53:54,396 --> 0:53:55,756
it anymore, I'd like to ask

00:54:13,696 --> 0:54:14,696
the new documentation?

Yeah, all right, it's really

1909
00:54:17,116 --> 0:54:17,386
great.

let's take a look.

1913

So, the first thing that you'll

1914
00:54:22,896 --> 0:54:23,946
notice is that the device

the things that you're used to

00:54:54,836 --> 0:54:56,936
Changes option, where you'll be

1936
00:54:56,936 --> 0:54:58,296
able to see the differences

1937
00:54:58,296 --> 0:54:59,806
between the current OS release

1938
00:55:00,256 --> 0:55:01,356
and the upcoming beta.

1939
00:55:03,206 --> 0:55:03,906
Yes, great.

1940
00:55:04,516 --> 0:55:06,546
[ Applause ]

1941
00:55:07,046 --> 0:55:08,316
On the left-hand side, you can

1942
00:55:08,356 --> 0:55:09,236
see there's been one

1943
00:55:09,236 --> 0:55:10,916
modification to an existing key

1944
00:55:11,286 --> 0:55:12,796
and 12 new keys added.

1945
00:55:13,046 --> 0:55:14,976
As a note, to find out which

1946
00:55:14,976 --> 0:55:16,606
Xcode versions relate to which

1947
00:55:16,606 --> 0:55:18,136
OS releases, you can check the

1948
00:55:18,136 --> 0:55:19,136
Xcode release notes.

1949
00:55:20,446 --> 0:55:21,746
Below that, in the property

1950
00:55:21,746 --> 0:55:23,466
section, you can see all the

1951
00:55:23,466 --> 0:55:25,616
keys, their types, and their

1952
00:55:25,616 --> 0:55:26,946
default values that make up the

1953
00:55:26,946 --> 0:55:27,506
payload.

1954
00:55:28,606 --> 0:55:30,606
As we scroll down, you can see

1955
00:55:30,606 --> 0:55:32,416
that the keys are highlighted

1956
00:55:32,416 --> 0:55:34,576
with purple tildes are modified

1957
00:55:34,576 --> 0:55:36,976
keys, and the new keys that

1958
00:55:36,976 --> 0:55:38,316
we've added are highlighted with

1959
00:55:38,316 --> 0:55:39,386
the green plus sign.

1960
00:55:41,156 --> 0:55:42,876
Below that, we have a profile

1961
00:55:42,876 --> 0:55:44,456
availability table that shows

1962
00:55:44,456 --> 0:55:45,326
you all of the different

1963
00:55:45,326 --> 0:55:46,446
platforms the payload is

1964
00:55:46,446 --> 0:55:48,286
supported on, and below that, we

1965
00:55:48,286 --> 0:55:49,756
have related objects, such as

1966
00:55:49,756 --> 0:55:50,886
dictionaries, that make up the

1967
00:55:50,886 --> 0:55:52,976
payload, as well as other

1968
00:55:52,976 --> 0:55:54,076
related payloads you may be

1969
00:55:54,076 --> 0:55:56,286
interested in.

1970
00:55:57,136 --> 0:55:59,736
So, let's jump back to the

1971
00:55:59,736 --> 0:56:01,226

using the breadcrumbs at the top

1974
00:56:02,716 --> 0:56:03,176
of the page.

1975
00:56:04,016 --> 0:56:05,476
Now, with the Show API Changes

1976
00:56:05,476 --> 0:56:07,046
enabled, we can also see that

1977
00:56:07,046 --> 0:56:07,996
there have been some changes to

1978
00:56:07,996 --> 0:56:08,956
the MDM protocol.

1979
00:56:09,196 --> 0:56:09,986
So, let's take a look.

1980
00:56:11,856 --> 0:56:12,816
Here you'll find it

1981
00:56:12,816 --> 0:56:14,296
easy-to-search list of all of

1982
00:56:14,296 --> 0:56:16,026
the different commands and

1983
00:56:16,026 --> 0:56:17,186
queries that are available.

1984
00:56:17,756 --> 0:56:19,056
Let's take a look at the install

1985
00:56:19,056 --> 0:56:19,996
application command.

1986
00:56:20,856 --> 0:56:24,046
On the right-hand side, you'll

1987
00:56:24,046 --> 0:56:25,376
notice that we list all of the

1988
00:56:25,376 --> 0:56:27,166
platforms and the corresponding

1989
00:56:27,166 --> 0:56:28,466
OS releases where this feature

1990
00:56:28,466 --> 0:56:28,966
was added.

1991
00:56:30,236 --> 0:56:31,426
On the left-hand side, you can

1992
00:56:31,426 --> 0:56:32,826
see that we document the command

1993
00:56:32,826 --> 0:56:34,986
itself, as well as the response,

1994
00:56:36,216 --> 0:56:37,876
and below that, on the command

1995
00:56:37,876 --> 0:56:39,266
availability table, that shows

1996
00:56:39,266 --> 0:56:40,426
you all the different ways that

1997
00:56:40,426 --> 0:56:41,786
this command can be implemented.

1998
00:56:42,656 --> 0:56:43,816
So, let's take a look at the

1999
00:56:43,816 --> 0:56:45,246
actual MDM command itself.

2000
00:56:50,766 --> 0:56:51,926
All right, here, you can see a

2001
00:56:51,926 --> 0:56:53,336
list of all of the keys that

2002
00:56:53,336 --> 0:56:54,856
make up the install application

2003
00:56:54,856 --> 0:56:55,286
command.

2004
00:56:55,786 --> 0:56:58,146
So finally, I'd like to talk a

2005
00:56:58,146 --> 0:56:58,986
little bit about how we've

2006
00:56:58,986 --> 0:57:00,286
documented the changes for user

2007
00:56:58,986 --> 0:57:00,286
documented the changes for user

2008
00:57:00,286 --> 0:57:00,776
enrollments.

2009
00:57:01,396 --> 0:57:02,856
The availability tables are a

2010
00:57:02,856 --> 0:57:04,176
great way for you to see if a

2011
00:57:04,476 --> 0:57:05,686
feature is supported in User

2012
00:57:05,686 --> 0:57:07,506
Enrollment, but in some cases,

2013
00:57:07,506 --> 0:57:08,706
we've had to change the way that

2014
00:57:08,706 --> 0:57:10,816
specific keys behave, and the

2015
00:57:10,816 --> 0:57:12,216
restrictions payload is a great

2016
00:57:12,216 --> 0:57:13,296
example of this.

2017
00:57:14,746 --> 0:57:15,896
So here, you can see that we've

2018
00:57:15,896 --> 0:57:17,756
added help text to each key to

2019
00:57:17,756 --> 0:57:18,976
tell you how it can be used.

2020
00:57:19,276 --> 0:57:20,946
The Allow Account Modification

2021
00:57:20,946 --> 0:57:22,576
restriction, for example, can be

2022
00:57:22,576 --> 0:57:24,646
used on a supervised device and

2023
00:57:24,646 --> 0:57:26,586
is available on iOS 7 or later.

2024
00:57:27,596 --> 0:57:28,746
We know that for BYOD

2025
00:57:28,746 --> 0:57:30,566
enrollments, Managed Open In is

2026
00:57:30,566 --> 0:57:31,706
one of our most important

2027
00:57:31,706 --> 0:57:32,266
restrictions.

2028
00:57:32,776 --> 0:57:33,966
So, let's take a look how that's

2029
00:57:33,996 --> 0:57:34,886
been implemented.

2030
00:57:35,616 --> 0:57:37,096
Here you can see that this is

2031
00:57:37,096 --> 0:57:39,966
available for iOS 7 or later and

2032
00:57:40,276 --> 0:57:41,576
also available for user

2033
00:57:41,576 --> 0:57:42,036
enrollments.

2034
00:57:42,466 --> 0:57:44,086
Well, we're really excited for

2035
00:57:44,086 --> 0:57:45,056

2036
00:57:45,056 --> 0:57:46,746
documentation, and with that, a

2037
00:57:46,746 --> 0:57:47,656

to the end of our content.

2047
00:58:03,296 --> 0:58:04,896
So again, we hope that new

2048
00:58:04,896 --> 0:58:06,086
documentation makes it much

2049
00:58:06,086 --> 0:58:07,076
easier for you to support

2050
00:58:07,076 --> 0:58:08,196
everything new, which of course,

2051
00:58:08,196 --> 0:58:10,026
we want you to do, and stop

2052
00:58:10,026 --> 0:58:12,186
