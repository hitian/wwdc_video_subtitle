3
00:00:20,146 --> 0:00:20,546
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

4
00:00:21,416 --> 0:00:22,266
Great to see you.

5
00:00:22,376 --> 0:00:24,016
I hope you're all having an

6
00:00:24,016 --> 0:00:25,156
awesome WWDC.

7
00:00:25,916 --> 0:00:27,696
We're super excited to be here

8
00:00:27,696 --> 0:00:29,156
today to chat with you about

9
00:00:29,276 --> 0:00:30,836
Building AR Experiences with

10
00:00:30,896 --> 0:00:31,686
Reality Composer.

11
00:00:32,516 --> 0:00:34,186
I'm Michelle and with me are my

12
00:00:34,186 --> 0:00:36,286
colleagues, Pau and Abhi.

13
00:00:36,496 --> 0:00:37,886
And today we're going to cover

14
00:00:37,886 --> 0:00:39,876
what Reality Composer is and how

15
00:00:39,876 --> 0:00:41,346
it can help you create an AR

16
00:00:41,656 --> 0:00:41,876
app.

17
00:00:42,326 --> 0:00:44,236
After this session, you'll know

18
00:00:44,236 --> 0:00:45,406
what's provided with Reality

19
00:00:45,406 --> 0:00:47,406
Composer, how to set up your

20
00:00:47,406 --> 0:00:49,106
experiences in it, and then how

21
00:00:49,106 --> 0:00:50,716
to take in-- take what you've

22
00:00:50,716 --> 0:00:53,366
created in Composer into your

23
00:00:53,506 --> 0:00:55,956
app in Xcode.

24
00:00:56,116 --> 0:00:58,126
So, first, what is Reality

25
00:00:58,126 --> 0:00:58,626
Composer?

26
00:00:58,986 --> 0:01:00,766
As you've heard earlier this

27
00:00:58,986 --> 0:01:00,766
As you've heard earlier this

28
00:01:00,766 --> 0:01:02,786
week, Reality Composer is a

29
00:01:02,786 --> 0:01:05,446
tool, an app, to help iOS

30
00:01:05,766 --> 0:01:07,586
developers get started in

31
00:01:07,586 --> 0:01:09,546
working with 3D and AR.

32
00:01:10,606 --> 0:01:12,886
Some of you have already begun

33
00:01:13,056 --> 0:01:14,886
and it's been really, really

34
00:01:14,886 --> 0:01:17,006
amazing to see what you've all

35
00:01:17,156 --> 0:01:19,136
been making, posting, and

36
00:01:19,226 --> 0:01:20,796
tagging with Reality Composer.

37
00:01:21,286 --> 0:01:23,986
So, please keep doing it.

38
00:01:24,576 --> 0:01:26,306
If you're not familiar with 3D,

39
00:01:26,556 --> 0:01:28,616
the first time you ever open a

40
00:01:28,616 --> 0:01:30,896
3D app can be pretty daunting

41
00:01:31,116 --> 0:01:32,496
and it can be kind of time

42
00:01:32,496 --> 0:01:35,036
consuming to even get started in

43
00:01:35,036 --> 0:01:35,276
AR.

44
00:01:36,186 --> 0:01:38,416
But with Reality Composer, it's

45
00:01:38,416 --> 0:01:41,186
really easy to just pre-vis and

46
00:01:41,276 --> 0:01:43,926
lay out your experiences using

47
00:01:43,926 --> 0:01:45,316
the built-in content library.

48
00:01:45,806 --> 0:01:47,936
Or, if you prefer, you can use

49
00:01:47,936 --> 0:01:49,236
your own USDZs.

50
00:01:49,236 --> 0:01:52,016
And if you're not familiar, USDZ

51
00:01:52,016 --> 0:01:54,456
is just a 3D file format that's

52
00:01:54,456 --> 0:01:56,146
supported in Reality Composer.

53
00:01:57,686 --> 0:01:58,926
Once you've got the experience

54
00:01:58,926 --> 0:02:00,426
laid out, you can add simple

55
00:01:58,926 --> 0:02:00,426
laid out, you can add simple

56
00:02:00,426 --> 0:02:02,586
interactions and animations with

57
00:02:02,586 --> 0:02:04,426
the behavior system before you

58
00:02:04,426 --> 0:02:06,076
even commit to writing any code.

59
00:02:06,456 --> 0:02:07,646
So, it really speeds up the

60
00:02:07,686 --> 0:02:09,336
iteration time on the experience

61
00:02:09,336 --> 0:02:09,816
itself.

62
00:02:10,566 --> 0:02:12,066
And then finally, everything

63
00:02:12,066 --> 0:02:13,116
that you've made in Reality

64
00:02:13,116 --> 0:02:14,606
Composer you can take directly

65
00:02:14,606 --> 0:02:17,736
into your app in Xcode.

66
00:02:18,236 --> 0:02:20,656
And so much about building for

67
00:02:20,656 --> 0:02:23,376
augmented reality is in seeing

68
00:02:23,536 --> 0:02:25,376
how the experience feels in

69
00:02:25,376 --> 0:02:27,476
physical space, looking at it on

70
00:02:27,476 --> 0:02:28,936
the intended device and seeing

71
00:02:29,166 --> 0:02:30,816
how your audience might see that

72
00:02:30,816 --> 0:02:31,446
experience.

73
00:02:32,616 --> 0:02:33,616
So, Reality Composer is

74
00:02:33,616 --> 0:02:37,466
available on macOS, iPhone and

75
00:02:37,616 --> 0:02:40,386
iPad, and you can edit on iOS so

76
00:02:40,386 --> 0:02:41,826
that you can develop on your

77
00:02:41,866 --> 0:02:44,216
regular dev machine and then

78
00:02:44,496 --> 0:02:46,806
edit on iOS in order to continue

79
00:02:46,806 --> 0:02:48,096
working on the exact same

80
00:02:48,096 --> 0:02:50,406
project on iPad or iPhone.

81
00:02:52,486 --> 0:02:53,716
Alternately, you can also just

82
00:02:53,716 --> 0:02:55,536
start the project on your iOS

83
00:02:55,536 --> 0:02:57,686
devices and take it the other

84
00:02:57,686 --> 0:02:57,856
way.

85
00:02:58,446 --> 0:03:04,386
So, today I'm going to take you

86
00:02:58,446 --> 0:03:04,386
So, today I'm going to take you

87
00:03:04,386 --> 0:03:05,696
through building scenes.

88
00:03:05,956 --> 0:03:07,726
Pau will cover adding behaviors

89
00:03:07,726 --> 0:03:08,666
and using physics.

90
00:03:08,666 --> 0:03:10,106
And then Abhi's going to take

91
00:03:10,146 --> 0:03:13,266
you through building an app.

92
00:03:13,566 --> 0:03:17,536
So, for building scenes, first,

93
00:03:17,536 --> 0:03:18,316
what's a scene?

94
00:03:18,516 --> 0:03:20,746
So, as you may have heard in the

95
00:03:20,746 --> 0:03:23,206
introduction to RealityKit and

96
00:03:23,206 --> 0:03:25,246
Reality Composer talk, a Reality

97
00:03:25,246 --> 0:03:26,986
Composer scene is essentially a

98
00:03:26,986 --> 0:03:29,126
collection of entities and it

99
00:03:29,126 --> 0:03:31,486
contains an anchor, objects,

100
00:03:31,996 --> 0:03:34,506
behaviors, and a physics world.

101
00:03:35,836 --> 0:03:37,776
Every scene has exactly one

102
00:03:37,826 --> 0:03:39,296
anchor, and when you start a

103
00:03:39,296 --> 0:03:41,156
project or when you start a

104
00:03:41,156 --> 0:03:42,996
scene, any scene, you'll be

105
00:03:42,996 --> 0:03:44,836
asked what kind of scene, what

106
00:03:44,836 --> 0:03:46,046
kind of experience are you

107
00:03:46,046 --> 0:03:46,486
building.

108
00:03:46,776 --> 0:03:48,576
If you're building something for

109
00:03:48,576 --> 0:03:51,956
a room, a stage, or a tabletop,

110
00:03:52,516 --> 0:03:53,466
you'll choose the horizontal

111
00:03:53,466 --> 0:03:53,766
anchor.

112
00:03:54,796 --> 0:03:56,246
If you want it to be on a wall,

113
00:03:56,586 --> 0:03:57,216
pick vertical.

114
00:03:58,396 --> 0:04:00,546
If you're augmenting a book or

115
00:03:58,396 --> 0:04:00,546
If you're augmenting a book or

116
00:04:00,546 --> 0:04:03,326
some packaging, a brochure, or a

117
00:04:03,326 --> 0:04:05,666
movie poster, choose the image

118
00:04:05,666 --> 0:04:06,076
anchor.

119
00:04:06,696 --> 0:04:08,506
And for selfie effects like

120
00:04:08,556 --> 0:04:11,446
glasses or hats, choose the face

121
00:04:11,446 --> 0:04:11,776
anchor.

122
00:04:12,726 --> 0:04:14,616
Projects can have multiple

123
00:04:14,616 --> 0:04:16,745
scenes but I think you'll find

124
00:04:16,745 --> 0:04:17,805
when you're first starting out,

125
00:04:17,805 --> 0:04:19,276
one or two scenes is usually

126
00:04:19,326 --> 0:04:19,805
sufficient.

127
00:04:20,406 --> 0:04:22,906
Okay, so in this case, let's

128
00:04:22,906 --> 0:04:24,346
assume that you've picked the

129
00:04:24,346 --> 0:04:25,296
horizontal anchor.

130
00:04:25,546 --> 0:04:27,596
And so here we are.

131
00:04:28,346 --> 0:04:29,896
The content is our focus in

132
00:04:29,896 --> 0:04:30,636
Reality Composer.

133
00:04:31,246 --> 0:04:33,236
So, it's laid out exactly as you

134
00:04:33,236 --> 0:04:35,556
would see it in AR in the Main

135
00:04:35,556 --> 0:04:37,476
View Port or the workspace.

136
00:04:37,526 --> 0:04:39,736
And this pane on the right here

137
00:04:40,956 --> 0:04:42,116
shows you the properties of

138
00:04:42,116 --> 0:04:44,406
whatever you selected and shows

139
00:04:44,406 --> 0:04:46,116
you options for configuring that

140
00:04:46,166 --> 0:04:49,106
entity, be it the object itself,

141
00:04:49,106 --> 0:04:50,656
like this text that's selected

142
00:04:50,656 --> 0:04:50,926
here.

143
00:04:50,926 --> 0:04:52,476
You can see that it's selected

144
00:04:52,816 --> 0:04:53,426
because of the ring.

145
00:04:53,426 --> 0:04:57,176
You can select the object, or a

146
00:04:57,176 --> 0:04:57,596
scene.

147
00:04:57,856 --> 0:05:00,256
I could show you more slides,

148
00:04:57,856 --> 0:05:00,256
I could show you more slides,

149
00:05:00,626 --> 0:05:02,836
but why don't we check out

150
00:05:02,836 --> 0:05:04,886
Composer together on iPad.

151
00:05:05,276 --> 0:05:07,046
Oh, I want you to remember this

152
00:05:07,046 --> 0:05:07,526
scene, though.

153
00:05:07,716 --> 0:05:08,456
Because we're going to be

154
00:05:08,456 --> 0:05:10,296
building up this little tutorial

155
00:05:10,686 --> 0:05:11,806
over the course of the session

156
00:05:11,806 --> 0:05:12,186
together.

157
00:05:12,516 --> 0:05:15,316
It's Seasons and Solar System

158
00:05:15,316 --> 0:05:15,706
lesson.

159
00:05:15,996 --> 0:05:19,946
We'll build up in AR.

160
00:05:20,796 --> 0:05:23,676
Okay, so for our demo, I'm going

161
00:05:23,676 --> 0:05:25,556
to show you three quite

162
00:05:25,616 --> 0:05:27,816
different RC projects today.

163
00:05:27,816 --> 0:05:30,026
The first is a little primer.

164
00:05:30,346 --> 0:05:34,426
And it's going to show you kind

165
00:05:34,486 --> 0:05:35,736
of just five really basic

166
00:05:35,736 --> 0:05:37,366
examples of things you could

167
00:05:37,366 --> 0:05:38,546
create in Reality Composer

168
00:05:38,546 --> 0:05:39,876
probably just in a couple of

169
00:05:39,876 --> 0:05:40,316
minutes.

170
00:05:40,926 --> 0:05:44,186
The second is a much more richer

171
00:05:44,186 --> 0:05:46,696
and more complex experience, a

172
00:05:46,696 --> 0:05:47,886
full experience, of what you

173
00:05:47,886 --> 0:05:49,156
could create just in Reality

174
00:05:49,156 --> 0:05:51,366
Composer alone if you didn't

175
00:05:51,366 --> 0:05:52,636
want to write code at all.

176
00:05:52,636 --> 0:05:53,816
So, this is great if you're not

177
00:05:53,816 --> 0:05:55,406
a developer or you're just kind

178
00:05:55,406 --> 0:05:56,506
of starting out and you want to

179
00:05:56,506 --> 0:05:58,246
just try out the experience

180
00:05:58,476 --> 0:06:00,926
before you fully commit to it

181
00:05:58,476 --> 0:06:00,926
before you fully commit to it

182
00:06:01,056 --> 0:06:02,946
when you make your app.

183
00:06:03,296 --> 0:06:04,776
And finally, we're going to

184
00:06:04,776 --> 0:06:06,826
build that Seasons scene that we

185
00:06:06,826 --> 0:06:07,536
saw together.

186
00:06:08,146 --> 0:06:11,186
Okay, so here is the primer in

187
00:06:11,186 --> 0:06:11,976
Reality Composer.

188
00:06:11,976 --> 0:06:14,606
And I'm going to take us into

189
00:06:14,606 --> 0:06:17,326
AR, because that was how we

190
00:06:17,326 --> 0:06:18,146
intended to see it.

191
00:06:18,956 --> 0:06:20,086
Okay, so these are the five

192
00:06:20,086 --> 0:06:21,426
examples I mentioned, and let's

193
00:06:21,586 --> 0:06:23,986
press play so that we kind of

194
00:06:23,986 --> 0:06:25,826
see the interactions.

195
00:06:26,176 --> 0:06:28,536
So, when we started, we're just,

196
00:06:28,536 --> 0:06:29,126
oh, hi everyone.

When we just started, the spiral

00:06:35,316 --> 0:06:37,106

It's kind of a fun sound.

206
00:06:46,076 --> 0:06:47,866
And then someone had asked if

207
00:06:47,866 --> 0:06:50,636
I'm an animator and I have my

208
00:06:50,636 --> 0:06:52,266
own models, I have my own

209
00:06:52,346 --> 0:06:54,676

210
00:06:54,676 --> 0:06:55,566
into Reality Composer?

211
00:06:55,566 --> 0:06:57,856
And yes, you can.

212
00:06:57,856 --> 0:06:59,746
And you can trigger them on user

00:06:59,746 --> 0:07:00,806

And if you're not an animator,

216
00:07:02,816 --> 0:07:04,546
you can use prebuilt emphasis

00:07:08,666 --> 0:07:09,936
pretty basic shapes but you can

221
00:07:09,936 --> 0:07:11,236
apply them, you know, to this

00:07:27,726 --> 0:07:28,986
Oh, and you're probably

229
00:07:28,986 --> 0:07:30,036
wondering how I'm moving the

230
00:07:30,036 --> 0:07:31,676
content around the scene and

00:07:31,676 --> 0:07:32,466
moving the camera.

232
00:07:32,866 --> 0:07:35,616
So, for panning, all I'm doing

233
00:07:35,616 --> 0:07:37,856
is taking two fingers, moving

234
00:07:37,936 --> 0:07:39,656
them across like this so I can

235
00:07:40,066 --> 0:07:41,406
see the content exactly as I

236
00:07:41,406 --> 0:07:41,726
want.

00:07:42,686 --> 0:07:43,906
If you were watching State of

00:07:57,806 --> 0:07:59,426
that we kind of envisioned here.

00:08:00,206 --> 0:08:02,036

to tap a location to learn more.

259
00:08:26,316 --> 0:08:28,166

261
00:08:29,516 --> 0:08:31,766

a lot is I work mostly in 2D and

Finally, you're probably

305
00:09:54,556 --> 0:09:55,756

clicking on this Behaviors

see the Behaviors we used to

create the flow of that sequence

00:10:12,116 --> 0:10:13,376
look, you might've noticed as I

316
00:10:13,376 --> 0:10:15,146
moved around the scene, those

317
00:10:15,196 --> 0:10:17,346
items looked at me.

00:10:21,346 --> 0:10:22,206
look at the camera.

321
00:10:22,786 --> 0:10:24,866
At the beginning, you saw just

322
00:10:25,246 --> 0:10:28,006
the island, and everything else

323
00:10:28,076 --> 0:10:28,626
was hidden.

324
00:10:28,626 --> 0:10:29,596
So, you can see that we hid

325
00:10:29,596 --> 0:10:31,126
everything else and then we

326
00:10:31,126 --> 0:10:32,766
showed them to you in sequence.

327
00:10:33,016 --> 0:10:34,926
So, we waited for 0.2 seconds,

328
00:10:35,256 --> 0:10:37,276
and then first we showed the

00:10:37,276 --> 0:10:38,386
helicopter text.

330
00:10:39,056 --> 0:10:40,526
Then we showed the helicopter

331
00:10:40,526 --> 0:10:42,016
itself and its tap to start.

332
00:10:42,016 --> 0:10:44,826
And then we faded the markers in

333
00:10:44,946 --> 0:10:45,996
from below, so that's what this

334
00:10:45,996 --> 0:10:47,336
move from below is doing and I

335
00:10:47,336 --> 0:10:48,766
can preview that to you now just

00:10:48,766 --> 0:10:50,356

00:10:50,976 --> 0:10:55,336
I'm going to show you also a

338
00:10:55,336 --> 0:10:56,216

340
00:10:57,536 --> 0:11:00,066
These birds, you might've

341
00:11:00,736 --> 0:11:00,946
noticed--

342
00:11:05,616 --> 0:11:07,346
I'm just going to look at them

343
00:11:07,346 --> 0:11:07,646
here.

344
00:11:07,966 --> 0:11:10,226
So, we asked them to orbit the

345
00:11:10,226 --> 0:11:11,466
island as a group.

346
00:11:12,326 --> 0:11:14,646
And they're not really birds at

347
00:11:14,646 --> 0:11:15,106
all.

348
00:11:15,376 --> 0:11:17,886
They're just primitives that

349
00:11:17,886 --> 0:11:19,336
we're using, or just basic

350
00:11:19,336 --> 0:11:22,346
shapes that we've put two move

351
00:11:22,346 --> 0:11:24,876
cards on to flap their wings.

352
00:11:25,006 --> 0:11:26,396
So instead of investing time in

353
00:11:26,396 --> 0:11:27,936
creating birds, all we did was

354
00:11:27,936 --> 0:11:29,236
we took a couple shapes and put

355
00:11:29,336 --> 0:11:32,426
two action cards on them to make

356
00:11:32,426 --> 0:11:33,136
an animation.

357
00:11:33,696 --> 0:11:35,126
And if you've tried to animate

358
00:11:35,186 --> 0:11:36,516
something in 3D before, you know

359
00:11:36,516 --> 0:11:38,446
how time consuming a simple

360
00:11:38,476 --> 0:11:39,916
thing like this can be, and this

361
00:11:39,956 --> 0:11:41,286
takes just a couple of seconds.

362
00:11:41,906 --> 0:11:46,916
So, that's an example of a full

363
00:11:46,916 --> 0:11:48,786
experience that you can make in

364
00:11:48,786 --> 0:11:51,066

And the really great part about

367
00:11:53,656 --> 0:11:55,246
this is that once you have this

368
00:11:55,246 --> 0:11:57,456

369
00:11:57,456 --> 0:11:59,986

00:12:45,906 --> 0:12:47,496
a little bit, to move the

392
00:12:47,496 --> 0:12:47,726
camera.

393
00:12:48,316 --> 0:12:51,486
So, let's grab this arrow to

394
00:12:51,486 --> 0:12:52,326
move the Earth over.

395
00:12:52,326 --> 0:12:56,636
And then next I need also a

396
00:12:56,636 --> 0:12:57,286
Moon.

397
00:12:58,026 --> 0:12:59,276
So, let's duplicate this guy one

398
00:12:59,276 --> 0:12:59,976
more time.

399
00:13:00,686 --> 0:13:02,056
Bring it over to about here.

400
00:13:02,056 --> 0:13:04,926
And then I can kind of grab

401
00:13:04,926 --> 0:13:06,516
anywhere in this ring to move it

402
00:13:06,516 --> 0:13:07,466
up in this plane.

403
00:13:08,056 --> 0:13:09,176
So let's move it over.

404
00:13:09,596 --> 0:13:10,086
Okay, great.

405
00:13:10,086 --> 0:13:12,776
And now I want to scale the Moon

406
00:13:12,776 --> 0:13:13,806
down a little bit.

407
00:13:14,356 --> 0:13:15,236
So I'm just going to grab the

408
00:13:15,236 --> 0:13:17,186
ring and move inwards to scale

409
00:13:17,856 --> 0:13:17,926
it.

410
00:13:19,876 --> 0:13:20,656
There we go.

411
00:13:21,706 --> 0:13:22,956
Move it a little closer.

412
00:13:23,996 --> 0:13:24,886
Okay, so I have these three

413
00:13:24,886 --> 0:13:25,546
celestial bodies.

414
00:13:25,856 --> 0:13:27,406
Let's scale the Sun up.

415
00:13:27,446 --> 0:13:28,516
So I'll grab the ring again.

416
00:13:28,936 --> 0:13:30,176
Just grab it to scale.

417
00:13:31,586 --> 0:13:32,286
Scale the Sun.

418
00:13:32,766 --> 0:13:35,896
So we've got our three items

419
00:13:35,926 --> 0:13:36,126
there.

420
00:13:37,886 --> 0:13:40,366
Next I'm going to add some text.

421
00:13:40,696 --> 0:13:41,666
So I go to the content library

422
00:13:41,666 --> 0:13:42,026
again.

423
00:13:42,616 --> 0:13:43,596
Let's grab the text.

424
00:13:43,596 --> 0:13:46,526
And it's a little bit below

425
00:13:46,526 --> 0:13:47,836
where I want it to be, so I'm

426
00:13:47,836 --> 0:13:49,496
just going to grab this green

427
00:13:49,496 --> 0:13:50,366
arrow and drag it up.

428
00:13:51,336 --> 0:13:52,926
And you can see it pop up to the

429
00:13:52,926 --> 0:13:53,956
ground plane.

430
00:13:54,086 --> 0:13:56,536
And it's doing that because I

431
00:13:56,536 --> 0:13:57,546
have snapping turned on.

432
00:13:57,546 --> 0:13:58,466
So, if you look in the left

433
00:13:58,466 --> 0:13:59,276
corner, we have this little

434
00:13:59,276 --> 0:14:00,846
magnet, and I can turn snapping

435
00:13:59,276 --> 0:14:00,846
magnet, and I can turn snapping

436
00:14:00,846 --> 0:14:02,256
off if I want to move stuff

437
00:14:02,366 --> 0:14:03,586
freely, but actually I just want

438
00:14:03,616 --> 0:14:04,986
to pull this blue arrow to bring

439
00:14:04,986 --> 0:14:05,456
it forward.

440
00:14:05,886 --> 0:14:08,686
And I want it to be about half a

441
00:14:08,686 --> 0:14:13,106
meter or so from the Sun.

442
00:14:13,276 --> 0:14:16,396
And I'm going to open the pane

443
00:14:16,396 --> 0:14:17,886
that we saw on the right to

444
00:14:17,886 --> 0:14:19,156
change up the text.

445
00:14:19,586 --> 0:14:21,316
So, let's just make it say

446
00:14:21,406 --> 0:14:21,776
autumn.

447
00:14:22,356 --> 0:14:26,646
It's super easy to just add

448
00:14:26,646 --> 0:14:28,716
these elements in Composer.

449
00:14:29,046 --> 0:14:32,096
So, finally, I think that's

450
00:14:32,306 --> 0:14:34,156
pretty much where I want it to

451
00:14:34,356 --> 0:14:34,496
be.

452
00:14:34,496 --> 0:14:35,506
So, all I'm doing to move the

453
00:14:35,506 --> 0:14:37,126
camera around is using my finger

454
00:14:37,126 --> 0:14:37,956
and touching the screen.

455
00:14:38,956 --> 0:14:44,096
Next I'm going to add an arrow.

456
00:14:44,586 --> 0:14:47,946
And it's not pointing the right

457
00:14:47,946 --> 0:14:49,706
direction I want it to be, kind

458
00:14:49,706 --> 0:14:50,346
of rotated.

459
00:14:50,346 --> 0:14:52,276
So, I'm going to move the camera

460
00:14:52,756 --> 0:14:54,986
so I can see the green ring

461
00:14:55,376 --> 0:14:57,266
which is sitting on the ground

462
00:14:57,266 --> 0:14:57,536
plane.

463
00:14:57,826 --> 0:15:00,136
This ring rotates with the

464
00:14:57,826 --> 0:15:00,136
This ring rotates with the

465
00:15:00,136 --> 0:15:01,386
camera as I move, so I can

466
00:15:01,386 --> 0:15:03,186
always be working in the plane

467
00:15:03,356 --> 0:15:04,766
that I want to be working in.

468
00:15:05,066 --> 0:15:07,116
If I don't want to move the

469
00:15:07,116 --> 0:15:08,496
camera to have to do that, I can

470
00:15:08,496 --> 0:15:10,696
just tap on the arrow and that

471
00:15:10,696 --> 0:15:11,936
will lock into the corresponding

472
00:15:11,936 --> 0:15:12,086
area.

473
00:15:12,086 --> 0:15:12,856
You can see the ring got a

474
00:15:12,856 --> 0:15:13,696
little fatter there.

475
00:15:14,226 --> 0:15:16,636
So I'm just going to rotate the

476
00:15:16,636 --> 0:15:18,356
area and it's snapping to 15

477
00:15:18,356 --> 0:15:19,116
degree increments.

478
00:15:19,116 --> 0:15:20,006
Again, because I have that

479
00:15:20,046 --> 0:15:21,046
snapping turned on.

480
00:15:21,506 --> 0:15:23,076
But if I didn't want to have it

481
00:15:23,076 --> 0:15:24,396
snap, I could move it freely.

482
00:15:24,456 --> 0:15:25,856
So here I'm dragging it and it's

483
00:15:25,856 --> 0:15:28,726
moving always in the horizontal

484
00:15:28,726 --> 0:15:30,056
plane for this green ring here.

485
00:15:30,836 --> 0:15:31,966
But I actually do want it to

486
00:15:31,966 --> 0:15:34,416
snap between the Sun, sphere,

487
00:15:34,416 --> 0:15:35,586
and the autumn text.

488
00:15:35,586 --> 0:15:36,576
So, I'm going to turn snapping

489
00:15:36,576 --> 0:15:36,826
on.

490
00:15:36,826 --> 0:15:39,066
You can see it snapping into

491
00:15:39,066 --> 0:15:39,306
place.

492
00:15:39,646 --> 0:15:41,626
So, it's just super useful,

493
00:15:41,626 --> 0:15:42,186
super easy.

494
00:15:42,956 --> 0:15:46,086
Then I want to modify this arrow

495
00:15:46,086 --> 0:15:46,646
a little bit.

496
00:15:47,056 --> 0:15:50,186
So, I can go ahead and click the

497
00:15:50,186 --> 0:15:52,466
icon next to snapping to modify

498
00:15:52,926 --> 0:15:52,993
it.

499
00:15:53,146 --> 0:15:54,906
I'm just going to zoom this in a

500
00:15:54,906 --> 0:15:56,026
little so we can see better.

501
00:15:56,116 --> 0:15:58,376
And I can grab this handle.

502
00:15:58,806 --> 0:15:59,406
Drag it.

503
00:16:00,736 --> 0:16:02,356
I'm also just going to make this

504
00:16:02,926 --> 0:16:04,926
just a touch smaller, a little

505
00:16:04,996 --> 0:16:05,376
flatter.

506
00:16:06,906 --> 0:16:09,196
Okay. And then I'm going to move

507
00:16:09,196 --> 0:16:12,276
it just a little bit more.

508
00:16:12,496 --> 0:16:13,656
Okay, so now everything is kind

509
00:16:13,656 --> 0:16:15,086
of blocked out, and we did that

510
00:16:15,086 --> 0:16:15,936
in just a couple minutes.

511
00:16:16,936 --> 0:16:19,316
I actually want to replace these

512
00:16:19,346 --> 0:16:21,046
celestial bodies because they're

513
00:16:21,046 --> 0:16:22,356
all pretty indistinct right now

514
00:16:22,536 --> 0:16:24,386
and I want to import some custom

515
00:16:24,386 --> 0:16:24,966
USDZs.

516
00:16:25,736 --> 0:16:27,266
And since I already have them

517
00:16:27,266 --> 0:16:29,416
placed exactly where I want, I'm

518
00:16:29,416 --> 0:16:30,246
going to do a replace.

519
00:16:30,246 --> 0:16:32,206
So I just tap on this object.

520
00:16:32,506 --> 0:16:33,726
I get this edit menu.

521
00:16:34,086 --> 0:16:34,816
Hit replace.

522
00:16:35,146 --> 0:16:40,946
And I'm going to import the Sun,

523
00:16:41,996 --> 0:16:43,886
and it'll just replace.

524
00:16:43,886 --> 0:16:45,386
And you can see it's the same

525
00:16:45,476 --> 0:16:47,226
scale and it's exactly in the

526
00:16:47,226 --> 0:16:48,336
right position that I wanted.

527
00:16:48,956 --> 0:16:52,906
I can do the same with the

528
00:16:52,906 --> 0:16:53,256
Earth.

529
00:16:53,256 --> 0:16:55,946
So let's do that really quick.

530
00:16:56,116 --> 0:16:57,976
There it is.

531
00:16:58,186 --> 0:17:01,746
And the Moon, I'm just going to

532
00:16:58,186 --> 0:17:01,746
And the Moon, I'm just going to

533
00:17:03,326 --> 0:17:04,766
customize it a little bit here

534
00:17:04,766 --> 0:17:06,925
with some, let's see, I want the

535
00:17:06,925 --> 0:17:07,986
map material.

536
00:17:08,326 --> 0:17:09,386
And I can make the Moon, like,

537
00:17:09,596 --> 0:17:10,886
any color that I want, but I

538
00:17:10,886 --> 0:17:12,665
think I'm just going to pick

539
00:17:12,726 --> 0:17:14,866
grey for the sake of safety.

540
00:17:15,096 --> 0:17:18,826
And if I want to see any of

541
00:17:18,826 --> 0:17:19,925
these items a little better, I

542
00:17:19,925 --> 0:17:21,976
can just double tap on them to

543
00:17:22,026 --> 0:17:22,766
frame the object.

544
00:17:23,066 --> 0:17:24,046
It's a really easy way to get

545
00:17:24,046 --> 0:17:24,906
around the scene.

546
00:17:25,786 --> 0:17:27,106
Or if I want to see the scene,

547
00:17:27,346 --> 0:17:29,696
pull back, I can double tap on

548
00:17:30,106 --> 0:17:31,576
anywhere in the grid to see the

549
00:17:31,576 --> 0:17:31,936
scene.

550
00:17:32,406 --> 0:17:33,396
Those shortcuts are here too.

551
00:17:33,476 --> 0:17:36,766
Frame scene or frame selected.

552
00:17:39,466 --> 0:17:42,066
Okay, so we're just about ready,

553
00:17:42,066 --> 0:17:43,666
I think, to add Behaviors.

554
00:17:44,026 --> 0:17:45,236
I could add all of the other

555
00:17:45,286 --> 0:17:46,526
elements but for the sake of

556
00:17:46,526 --> 0:17:49,126
time we won't do all of that

557
00:17:49,126 --> 0:17:49,326
now.

558
00:17:49,326 --> 0:17:50,846
There's a few tips I want to

559
00:17:50,846 --> 0:17:52,766
leave you with before we finish

560
00:17:52,816 --> 0:17:55,666
this part of the demo.

561
00:17:55,666 --> 0:17:57,156
That replace that you saw?

562
00:17:57,946 --> 0:17:59,436
If we had Behaviors applied to

563
00:17:59,436 --> 0:18:00,816
this already like we were doing

564
00:17:59,436 --> 0:18:00,816
this already like we were doing

565
00:18:01,236 --> 0:18:03,146
any animations on, like, let's

566
00:18:03,146 --> 0:18:05,446
say the Sun, if I replaced it,

567
00:18:05,976 --> 0:18:07,046
those Behaviors would stay.

568
00:18:07,206 --> 0:18:08,566
So, it's a huge time saver if

569
00:18:08,566 --> 0:18:09,766
you're just like swapping in new

570
00:18:09,766 --> 0:18:12,186
versions of content.

571
00:18:12,456 --> 0:18:13,196
It's really powerful.

572
00:18:13,966 --> 0:18:15,386
And then also we mentioned

573
00:18:15,476 --> 0:18:16,516
having multiple scenes.

574
00:18:16,516 --> 0:18:18,096
You can access them here with

575
00:18:18,096 --> 0:18:19,316
the Scene Selector in the top

576
00:18:19,356 --> 0:18:19,836
left.

577
00:18:20,316 --> 0:18:21,446
And so if you wanted to add any

578
00:18:21,446 --> 0:18:24,776
more scenes, you just add them

579
00:18:24,976 --> 0:18:25,330
here.

580
00:18:27,656 --> 0:18:29,206
If you are working with these

581
00:18:29,206 --> 0:18:31,266
entities in Xcode, you're going

582
00:18:31,266 --> 0:18:32,206
to want to name them.

583
00:18:32,206 --> 0:18:33,556
And you'll see more about this

584
00:18:33,556 --> 0:18:34,666
later on in the session.

585
00:18:35,136 --> 0:18:36,416
And you can do that when you

586
00:18:36,416 --> 0:18:37,126
open the pane.

587
00:18:37,126 --> 0:18:38,326
There's a configure panel and

588
00:18:38,326 --> 0:18:39,436
you can just name the entity

589
00:18:39,436 --> 0:18:39,766
here.

590
00:18:40,056 --> 0:18:43,656
I'm going to name it Sun.

591
00:18:43,756 --> 0:18:44,716
Finally, if there's something

592
00:18:44,716 --> 0:18:46,316
you didn't want to do, like

593
00:18:46,316 --> 0:18:49,226
let's say I moved the Earth and

594
00:18:49,226 --> 0:18:50,126
I didn't want to do that.

595
00:18:50,466 --> 0:18:51,906
I can undo that action.

596
00:18:52,276 --> 0:18:56,806
I can also long press and redo

597
00:18:56,976 --> 0:18:59,696
and it'll tell me, like, what

598
00:18:59,696 --> 0:19:02,996
the undo that I, what the undo

599
00:18:59,696 --> 0:19:02,996
the undo that I, what the undo

600
00:19:03,226 --> 0:19:08,226
is that I'm about to invoke.

601
00:19:09,346 --> 0:19:09,456
Okay.

602
00:19:09,686 --> 0:19:10,896
Finally, some folks have asked

603
00:19:10,896 --> 0:19:12,026
what's the easiest way for me to

604
00:19:12,026 --> 0:19:13,636
share my RC projects?

605
00:19:13,756 --> 0:19:15,866
And you can airdrop them between

606
00:19:15,866 --> 0:19:16,486
your devices.

607
00:19:16,886 --> 0:19:18,326
Or like we talked about earlier,

608
00:19:18,326 --> 0:19:20,266
you can use the edit on iOS to

609
00:19:20,266 --> 0:19:21,746
go easily between your

610
00:19:21,746 --> 0:19:23,716
development machine and your iOS

611
00:19:23,746 --> 0:19:24,000
devices.

612
00:19:26,736 --> 0:19:26,856
Okay.

613
00:19:27,836 --> 0:19:30,616
So, that's our scene now, ready

614
00:19:30,616 --> 0:19:32,006
for Behaviors.

615
00:19:33,096 --> 0:19:35,216
So, you just saw how to build

616
00:19:35,216 --> 0:19:37,226
scenes in Reality Composer.

617
00:19:37,916 --> 0:19:39,566
So, we took you through how to

618
00:19:39,566 --> 0:19:41,476
lay stuff out quickly using the

619
00:19:41,476 --> 0:19:42,476
content library.

620
00:19:42,796 --> 0:19:44,426
We also showed you how to bring

621
00:19:44,806 --> 0:19:47,966
in your own custom USDZs.

622
00:19:47,966 --> 0:19:49,306
And now we're going to move on

623
00:19:49,386 --> 0:19:51,896
to adding interactions and

624
00:19:51,896 --> 0:19:52,436
behaviors.

625
00:19:52,536 --> 0:19:53,796
So, to take you through all

626
00:19:54,406 --> 0:19:55,186
that, let's welcome my

627
00:19:55,186 --> 0:19:55,686
colleague, Pau.

628
00:19:56,516 --> 0:19:59,436
[ Applause ]

629
00:19:59,936 --> 0:20:02,336
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Michelle.

630
00:19:59,936 --> 0:20:02,336
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Michelle.

631
00:20:05,016 --> 0:20:07,666
So, now that we know how to

632
00:20:07,666 --> 0:20:09,526
bring content to the scene, it's

633
00:20:09,566 --> 0:20:11,576
time to bring all this content

634
00:20:11,576 --> 0:20:11,926
to life.

635
00:20:12,786 --> 0:20:15,346
So, you might want to play some

636
00:20:15,346 --> 0:20:16,776
music when the user taps on an

637
00:20:16,776 --> 0:20:18,836
object, or maybe show some text

638
00:20:18,936 --> 0:20:20,466
when the user gets close to an

639
00:20:20,466 --> 0:20:20,776
object.

640
00:20:21,556 --> 0:20:22,906
Or maybe you just want to play

641
00:20:22,906 --> 0:20:24,136
some USD animation.

642
00:20:25,026 --> 0:20:26,206
And so in order to do that and

643
00:20:26,206 --> 0:20:27,966
more, we need to take advantage

644
00:20:27,966 --> 0:20:29,026
of Behaviors in Reality

645
00:20:29,026 --> 0:20:29,476
Composer.

646
00:20:30,456 --> 0:20:31,296
So, let's get started.

647
00:20:32,246 --> 0:20:34,396
As we've seen before, a scene in

648
00:20:34,396 --> 0:20:35,656
Reality Composer contains an

649
00:20:35,656 --> 0:20:38,326
anchor, objects, behaviors, and

650
00:20:38,326 --> 0:20:38,946
the physics world.

651
00:20:39,916 --> 0:20:41,426
Behaviors are always scene

652
00:20:41,426 --> 0:20:41,766
scope.

653
00:20:41,816 --> 0:20:42,956
That means that you can only

654
00:20:42,956 --> 0:20:44,676
target objects within the same

655
00:20:44,746 --> 0:20:45,000
scene.

656
00:20:47,176 --> 0:20:48,666
So, let's take a closer look at

657
00:20:48,666 --> 0:20:49,536
what the behavior is.

658
00:20:50,736 --> 0:20:52,326
A behavior is composed by two

659
00:20:52,326 --> 0:20:54,196
items, the trigger and the

660
00:20:54,196 --> 0:20:54,856
action sequence.

661
00:20:55,616 --> 0:20:56,516
The trigger, as the name

662
00:20:56,516 --> 0:20:58,546
suggests, is simply the criteria

663
00:20:58,546 --> 0:20:59,646
for the action sequence to

664
00:20:59,646 --> 0:20:59,956
begin.

665
00:21:00,686 --> 0:21:02,276
So, let's say we have a scene

666
00:21:02,276 --> 0:21:03,786
with a model of a record player.

667
00:21:04,056 --> 0:21:05,696
And when the user taps on it, we

668
00:21:05,696 --> 0:21:07,706
want to play some music and spin

669
00:21:07,706 --> 0:21:08,386
at the same time.

670
00:21:09,476 --> 0:21:10,936
Well, in order to do that, you

671
00:21:10,936 --> 0:21:11,766
just need to create the new

672
00:21:11,766 --> 0:21:14,776
behavior, use a tap trigger, and

673
00:21:14,776 --> 0:21:15,996
then create an action sequence

674
00:21:16,046 --> 0:21:17,976
comprised of a music action and

675
00:21:18,036 --> 0:21:19,500
the spin action.

676
00:21:20,786 --> 0:21:21,866
So, the first thing when

677
00:21:21,866 --> 0:21:23,376
creating a new behavior is to

678
00:21:23,376 --> 0:21:26,266
pick what trigger will begin the

679
00:21:26,266 --> 0:21:26,906
action sequence.

680
00:21:27,826 --> 0:21:29,336
Reality Composer comes with five

681
00:21:29,336 --> 0:21:30,366
different triggers that you can

682
00:21:30,366 --> 0:21:30,666
use.

683
00:21:31,266 --> 0:21:34,426
With the start trigger, the

684
00:21:34,426 --> 0:21:35,886
action sequence will begin as

685
00:21:35,886 --> 0:21:37,116
soon as the scene is loaded.

686
00:21:37,116 --> 0:21:40,706
With the tap trigger, the action

687
00:21:40,706 --> 0:21:42,566
sequence will begin once the

688
00:21:42,566 --> 0:21:44,616
user taps on an object that you

689
00:21:44,616 --> 0:21:44,896
define.

690
00:21:45,526 --> 0:21:48,226
With a proximity trigger, you

691
00:21:48,226 --> 0:21:49,736
define a threshold distance from

692
00:21:49,736 --> 0:21:50,816
the object to the camera.

693
00:21:51,746 --> 0:21:53,186
Once the camera is close enough

694
00:21:53,186 --> 0:21:54,376
to the object, the action

695
00:21:54,376 --> 0:21:55,206
sequence will begin.

696
00:21:55,946 --> 0:21:58,756
With collision trigger, you

697
00:21:58,756 --> 0:22:00,656
define two objects, and once

698
00:21:58,756 --> 0:22:00,656
define two objects, and once

699
00:22:00,706 --> 0:22:02,966
those two objects collide, the

700
00:22:02,966 --> 0:22:04,176
action sequence will begin.

701
00:22:05,016 --> 0:22:06,186
And the last trigger is the

702
00:22:06,186 --> 0:22:07,146
notification trigger.

703
00:22:07,776 --> 0:22:09,466
This trigger is what allows you

704
00:22:09,466 --> 0:22:10,736
to begin action sequences

705
00:22:10,936 --> 0:22:12,156
programmatically from your app

706
00:22:12,216 --> 0:22:13,876
and we'll take a look at this

707
00:22:13,876 --> 0:22:15,116
trigger in the last section of

708
00:22:15,116 --> 0:22:16,000
this talk.

709
00:22:18,086 --> 0:22:19,376
So, now let's move into action

710
00:22:19,376 --> 0:22:19,906
sequences.

711
00:22:20,846 --> 0:22:23,096
There are three main ways that

712
00:22:23,096 --> 0:22:24,816
you can modify the execution of

713
00:22:24,816 --> 0:22:25,606
action sequences.

714
00:22:26,416 --> 0:22:28,626
Those are groups, loops, and

715
00:22:28,626 --> 0:22:29,856
exclusive action sequences.

716
00:22:31,166 --> 0:22:32,096
So, let's start with groups.

717
00:22:33,096 --> 0:22:35,056
By default, in Reality Composer,

718
00:22:35,236 --> 0:22:36,596
groups play sequentially.

719
00:22:36,796 --> 0:22:38,476
So, the actions go one after the

720
00:22:38,726 --> 0:22:38,816
other.

721
00:22:39,136 --> 0:22:40,916
But you can combine multiple

722
00:22:40,916 --> 0:22:42,106
actions if you want to play them

723
00:22:42,106 --> 0:22:42,576
in parallel.

724
00:22:43,136 --> 0:22:44,546
So, in this example, action two

725
00:22:44,546 --> 0:22:45,926
and three will play together

726
00:22:46,266 --> 0:22:47,896
right after action one finishes.

727
00:22:48,356 --> 0:22:50,366
And action four will only begin

728
00:22:50,596 --> 0:22:52,586
once all the action in the group

729
00:22:52,586 --> 0:22:53,476
are over.

730
00:22:55,376 --> 0:22:57,046
Action sequences can also be

731
00:22:57,046 --> 0:22:57,306
looped.

732
00:22:57,996 --> 0:22:59,286
So let's say you want to have

733
00:22:59,336 --> 0:23:01,016
some music in your scene and you

734
00:22:59,336 --> 0:23:01,016
some music in your scene and you

735
00:23:01,016 --> 0:23:02,566
want that music to loop forever.

736
00:23:03,076 --> 0:23:04,226
Well, you just need to create

737
00:23:04,226 --> 0:23:06,476
the behavior with music action

738
00:23:06,536 --> 0:23:08,066
in the action sequence and mark

739
00:23:08,136 --> 0:23:09,276
that action sequence to be

740
00:23:09,276 --> 0:23:09,486
looped.

741
00:23:10,146 --> 0:23:13,136
And the last part is the

742
00:23:13,136 --> 0:23:14,376
exclusive action sequences.

743
00:23:14,376 --> 0:23:16,606
In Reality Composer, you can

744
00:23:16,606 --> 0:23:19,346
mark an action sequence to be

745
00:23:19,956 --> 0:23:20,296
exclusive.

746
00:23:20,296 --> 0:23:21,776
Only one exclusive action

747
00:23:21,776 --> 0:23:23,276
sequences will play at any one

748
00:23:23,316 --> 0:23:23,586
time.

749
00:23:24,146 --> 0:23:26,336
That means once an exclusive

750
00:23:26,336 --> 0:23:28,666
action sequence starts or any

751
00:23:28,666 --> 0:23:29,786
other running exclusive action

752
00:23:29,786 --> 0:23:30,786
sequences will stop.

753
00:23:31,706 --> 0:23:33,286
And action sequences that are

754
00:23:33,286 --> 0:23:35,046
nonexclusive, they will play,

755
00:23:35,456 --> 0:23:36,876
like, together with other

756
00:23:36,946 --> 0:23:38,026
exclusive and nonexclusive

757
00:23:38,026 --> 0:23:38,696
action sequences.

758
00:23:39,296 --> 0:23:41,146
And that's pretty much all you

759
00:23:41,146 --> 0:23:42,946
need to know about action

760
00:23:42,946 --> 0:23:43,476
sequences.

761
00:23:43,766 --> 0:23:44,966
So now let's take a look at some

762
00:23:44,966 --> 0:23:46,236
of the actions available to you

763
00:23:46,706 --> 0:23:47,496
in Reality Composer.

764
00:23:48,176 --> 0:23:52,326
With the visibility actions, you

765
00:23:52,326 --> 0:23:54,256
can bring objects in and out of

766
00:23:54,256 --> 0:23:56,006
your scene using animations.

767
00:23:56,746 --> 0:23:59,286
So, we support multiple type of

768
00:23:59,286 --> 0:24:00,566
animations, and you can use

769
00:23:59,286 --> 0:24:00,566
animations, and you can use

770
00:24:00,566 --> 0:24:02,396
basic things like fade in-fade

771
00:24:02,396 --> 0:24:02,646
out.

772
00:24:03,556 --> 0:24:04,946
But you can also use more

773
00:24:04,946 --> 0:24:07,166
playful animations like scale up

774
00:24:07,166 --> 0:24:09,796
and then scale down.

775
00:24:12,856 --> 0:24:15,266
Reality Composer also supports

776
00:24:15,266 --> 0:24:18,396
animating objects in place with

777
00:24:18,396 --> 0:24:19,826
the emphasis similar to the show

778
00:24:19,826 --> 0:24:21,486
height, you can animate the

779
00:24:21,486 --> 0:24:22,916
object with different motion

780
00:24:22,916 --> 0:24:24,256
types and animation styles.

781
00:24:25,066 --> 0:24:27,246
So, you can use BasicPop, but

782
00:24:27,736 --> 0:24:30,186
you can also use a more playful

783
00:24:30,486 --> 0:24:31,186
pop animation.

784
00:24:31,186 --> 0:24:35,016
You can also spin or orbit your

785
00:24:35,016 --> 0:24:38,246
object around other objects and

786
00:24:38,246 --> 0:24:39,866
if you're using a USD asset in

787
00:24:39,866 --> 0:24:41,476
your file, you can use their

788
00:24:41,476 --> 0:24:42,586
transform and skeletal

789
00:24:42,586 --> 0:24:43,056
animation.

790
00:24:43,686 --> 0:24:48,156
Now, with the move actions, you

791
00:24:48,156 --> 0:24:50,456
can translate, scale, and rotate

792
00:24:50,586 --> 0:24:51,516
an object in the same.

793
00:24:51,716 --> 0:24:53,986
With the Move By, the movement

794
00:24:53,986 --> 0:24:55,616
will be relative to where the

795
00:24:55,616 --> 0:24:56,306
object is right now.

796
00:24:56,306 --> 0:24:58,366
Like in this example, where the

797
00:24:58,366 --> 0:25:00,786
object always goes two units

798
00:24:58,366 --> 0:25:00,786
object always goes two units

799
00:25:00,786 --> 0:25:01,926
forward and one left.

800
00:25:02,316 --> 0:25:04,436
And with the Move To, you can

801
00:25:04,436 --> 0:25:06,516
always move an object to a

802
00:25:06,516 --> 0:25:07,806
specified location in the scene.

803
00:25:08,546 --> 0:25:10,226
Like here, where the object is

804
00:25:10,226 --> 0:25:11,696
going back to the origin of the

805
00:25:11,696 --> 0:25:11,966
scene.

806
00:25:15,396 --> 0:25:17,006
With the Look At, you can make

807
00:25:17,006 --> 0:25:18,326
an object always face the

808
00:25:18,326 --> 0:25:18,706
camera.

809
00:25:19,206 --> 0:25:20,966
Like in this example, where the

810
00:25:20,966 --> 0:25:22,566
horse will always face the

811
00:25:22,566 --> 0:25:23,396
user's device.

812
00:25:27,456 --> 0:25:29,196
Now that we have all the

813
00:25:29,196 --> 0:25:31,466
animation actions, it's time to

814
00:25:31,466 --> 0:25:32,946
bring some sound to your

815
00:25:32,946 --> 0:25:33,516
experience.

816
00:25:34,096 --> 0:25:35,256
In Reality Composer, there's

817
00:25:35,396 --> 0:25:36,496
three actions that you can use

818
00:25:36,496 --> 0:25:37,716
to bring some audio to your

819
00:25:37,716 --> 0:25:38,466
scene.

820
00:25:39,566 --> 0:25:40,986
With Play Sound, the audio will

821
00:25:40,986 --> 0:25:42,076
originate from the object

822
00:25:42,076 --> 0:25:42,426
itself.

823
00:25:42,926 --> 0:25:44,276
Like here, where the horse is

824
00:25:44,276 --> 0:25:46,066
doing a horse sound.

825
00:25:46,966 --> 0:25:48,446
With Play Ambient, the sound

826
00:25:48,446 --> 0:25:49,766
will be scene-oriented.

827
00:25:50,346 --> 0:25:53,746
And with Play Music, the audio

828
00:25:53,746 --> 0:25:54,746
will play without any

829
00:25:54,746 --> 0:25:55,476
transformations.

830
00:25:55,776 --> 0:25:58,986
So now let's take a quick demo,

831
00:25:59,166 --> 0:26:00,556
and let's take a quick look at

832
00:25:59,166 --> 0:26:00,556
and let's take a quick look at

833
00:26:00,556 --> 0:26:02,346
how to bring some behaviors to

834
00:26:02,346 --> 0:26:04,176
the scene Michelle was building

835
00:26:04,176 --> 0:26:04,506
before.

836
00:26:05,196 --> 0:26:07,346
Here we have a more complete

837
00:26:07,346 --> 0:26:10,046
scene compared to what Michelle

838
00:26:10,046 --> 0:26:10,496
was building.

839
00:26:10,496 --> 0:26:12,566
So, we have the Moon, the Earth,

840
00:26:12,566 --> 0:26:14,406
the Sun, and we have some text

841
00:26:14,406 --> 0:26:16,526
and some sunrays showing the

842
00:26:16,526 --> 0:26:17,326
different seasons.

843
00:26:18,176 --> 0:26:20,176
So, let's bring up the behavior

844
00:26:20,176 --> 0:26:21,646
final by clicking on the

845
00:26:21,646 --> 0:26:22,986
behaviors button on the top

846
00:26:22,986 --> 0:26:23,496
right corner.

847
00:26:24,056 --> 0:26:27,006
And as you see here, there's

848
00:26:27,006 --> 0:26:28,366
already some behaviors.

849
00:26:28,746 --> 0:26:30,866
So let's hit play and see what

850
00:26:30,986 --> 0:26:32,826
is going on in this scene.

851
00:26:34,636 --> 0:26:36,466
So, you see here, there's no

852
00:26:36,466 --> 0:26:37,576
movement for the Moon, the

853
00:26:37,576 --> 0:26:38,286
Earth, or the Sun.

854
00:26:38,926 --> 0:26:40,356
But the different rays and

855
00:26:40,356 --> 0:26:42,446
seasons, text, are appearing in

856
00:26:42,446 --> 0:26:43,246
a sequential order.

857
00:26:43,826 --> 0:26:45,416
So, let's go ahead and create

858
00:26:45,416 --> 0:26:48,056
the new behavior for 20 minutes

859
00:26:48,056 --> 0:26:49,516
the different Moon, Earth, and

860
00:26:49,516 --> 0:26:50,396
Sun objects.

861
00:26:50,866 --> 0:26:52,556
So for that, let's start by

862
00:26:52,556 --> 0:26:53,826
bringing a new behavior.

863
00:26:55,256 --> 0:26:56,546
We hit plus, and then here we

864
00:26:56,546 --> 0:26:58,126
can see all the available

865
00:26:58,276 --> 0:27:00,696
presets that we can pick from.

866
00:26:58,276 --> 0:27:00,696
presets that we can pick from.

867
00:27:01,016 --> 0:27:02,456
But for this demo, we're going

868
00:27:02,456 --> 0:27:03,606
to start with a custom trigger.

869
00:27:03,606 --> 0:27:07,576
Now the first thing is to pick

870
00:27:07,576 --> 0:27:10,146
what trigger we want to use to

871
00:27:10,146 --> 0:27:11,556
begin the action sequence.

872
00:27:11,556 --> 0:27:12,646
And because we want to start

873
00:27:12,646 --> 0:27:14,376
animating these objects when the

874
00:27:14,416 --> 0:27:16,666
scene is loaded, we can bring up

875
00:27:16,666 --> 0:27:18,806
the library and choose the scene

876
00:27:18,896 --> 0:27:19,546
start.

877
00:27:20,836 --> 0:27:22,626
Great. Now it's time to start

878
00:27:22,626 --> 0:27:23,576
with the action sequence.

879
00:27:24,176 --> 0:27:26,296
For this action sequence, we

880
00:27:26,296 --> 0:27:28,286
want the Earth to orbit around

881
00:27:28,286 --> 0:27:29,876
the Sun, and then the Moon to

882
00:27:29,876 --> 0:27:30,986
orbit around the Earth.

883
00:27:31,116 --> 0:27:32,356
And at the same time, we want to

884
00:27:32,356 --> 0:27:33,816
spin the Earth and the Sun.

885
00:27:34,566 --> 0:27:35,796
So let's start with the orbits.

886
00:27:37,596 --> 0:27:39,406
So we can bring the action

887
00:27:39,406 --> 0:27:41,696
library and then select orbit as

888
00:27:41,696 --> 0:27:42,506
the first action.

889
00:27:42,506 --> 0:27:44,286
The first thing when creating a

890
00:27:44,286 --> 0:27:45,936
new action is to define what

891
00:27:46,206 --> 0:27:48,476
targets are the targets of the

892
00:27:48,476 --> 0:27:48,836
action.

893
00:27:49,046 --> 0:27:50,316
So in this case, the affected

894
00:27:50,316 --> 0:27:52,346
object is going to be the Earth,

895
00:27:53,076 --> 0:27:54,696
and the center is going to be

896
00:27:55,006 --> 0:27:55,366
the Sun.

897
00:27:56,856 --> 0:27:57,346
Great.

898
00:27:57,856 --> 0:27:59,186
We have all the properties like

899
00:27:59,256 --> 0:28:01,426
duration, revolutions, align to

900
00:27:59,256 --> 0:28:01,426
duration, revolutions, align to

901
00:28:01,426 --> 0:28:03,146
path, and orbit direction.

902
00:28:03,566 --> 0:28:04,856
And for the direction, we want

903
00:28:04,856 --> 0:28:06,086
to use counter-clockwise.

904
00:28:07,776 --> 0:28:09,666
So, now, we can easily preview

905
00:28:09,666 --> 0:28:11,086
this action by just hitting play

906
00:28:11,516 --> 0:28:13,656
on the play button in the action

907
00:28:13,656 --> 0:28:13,876
card.

908
00:28:15,136 --> 0:28:16,666
That was a bit fast.

909
00:28:16,936 --> 0:28:18,386
So, let's change the duration to

910
00:28:18,386 --> 0:28:21,436
something more suited for this

911
00:28:21,436 --> 0:28:21,756
scene.

912
00:28:22,136 --> 0:28:23,636
Let's start with 20 seconds.

913
00:28:24,216 --> 0:28:26,796
You can change duration and try

914
00:28:27,776 --> 0:28:28,126
again.

915
00:28:28,306 --> 0:28:29,466
And yeah, I think that duration

916
00:28:29,646 --> 0:28:30,046
looks right.

917
00:28:30,776 --> 0:28:32,616
Now, let's bring the second

918
00:28:32,616 --> 0:28:32,876
orbit.

919
00:28:33,876 --> 0:28:36,706
So, we can bring again the

920
00:28:36,706 --> 0:28:38,416
library and select orbit.

921
00:28:39,496 --> 0:28:40,646
Now, the affected object is

922
00:28:40,646 --> 0:28:42,806
going to be the Moon and the

923
00:28:42,806 --> 0:28:45,446
center will be the Earth.

924
00:28:46,096 --> 0:28:47,896
The duration, we want it to be

925
00:28:47,896 --> 0:28:48,746
the same as before.

926
00:28:49,406 --> 0:28:51,316
And for the revolutions, because

927
00:28:51,316 --> 0:28:52,126
we are not trying to be

928
00:28:52,126 --> 0:28:53,326
physically accurate, we just

929
00:28:53,326 --> 0:28:54,426
want to have something that

930
00:28:54,426 --> 0:28:56,356
looks nice in the scene, we're

931
00:28:56,356 --> 0:28:58,146
going to use four.

932
00:28:58,296 --> 0:28:59,356
I think four is a good number.

933
00:28:59,716 --> 0:29:01,216
And now because the Moon is

934
00:28:59,716 --> 0:29:01,216
And now because the Moon is

935
00:29:01,276 --> 0:29:02,496
tidally locked with the Earth,

936
00:29:03,366 --> 0:29:04,846
we want the Moon to be aligned

937
00:29:04,846 --> 0:29:05,346
to the orbit.

938
00:29:05,706 --> 0:29:07,666
So, we have to select align to

939
00:29:07,696 --> 0:29:07,986
path.

940
00:29:08,656 --> 0:29:10,306
And now the direction will be

941
00:29:10,306 --> 0:29:11,436
also counter clockwise.

942
00:29:12,276 --> 0:29:14,636
So, let's give that a try and

943
00:29:14,966 --> 0:29:16,586
yeah, this animation looks

944
00:29:17,036 --> 0:29:17,166
right.

945
00:29:18,156 --> 0:29:19,756
So now that we have the orbits

946
00:29:19,756 --> 0:29:22,176
out of our way, let's begin with

947
00:29:22,176 --> 0:29:22,896
the spin actions.

948
00:29:23,746 --> 0:29:25,526
So for that, we bring another

949
00:29:25,526 --> 0:29:28,556
spin action and let's start with

950
00:29:28,556 --> 0:29:29,006
the Sun.

951
00:29:30,246 --> 0:29:31,386
Same direction as before.

952
00:29:31,496 --> 0:29:32,666
So, 20 seconds.

953
00:29:33,116 --> 0:29:34,826
And for iterations, I think four

954
00:29:34,826 --> 0:29:35,986
will be a good number.

955
00:29:38,136 --> 0:29:40,016
And same direction, so counter

956
00:29:40,016 --> 0:29:40,406
clockwise.

957
00:29:41,286 --> 0:29:43,776
If we hit play, we see that

958
00:29:43,776 --> 0:29:45,126
that's a good speed for the

959
00:29:45,126 --> 0:29:45,456
spin.

960
00:29:46,366 --> 0:29:48,686
Right. So, now, let's bring the

961
00:29:48,856 --> 0:29:51,116
last action in the sequence

962
00:29:51,116 --> 0:29:52,376
which is the spin for the Earth.

963
00:29:53,676 --> 0:29:55,286
So, we create another spin.

964
00:29:55,656 --> 0:29:56,546
We select the Earth.

965
00:29:57,356 --> 0:29:58,296
Same duration.

966
00:29:59,706 --> 0:30:01,026
And because we want to have a

967
00:29:59,706 --> 0:30:01,026
And because we want to have a

968
00:30:01,026 --> 0:30:02,526
higher number of iterations

969
00:30:02,526 --> 0:30:04,956
compared to the Sun, let's use

970
00:30:05,576 --> 0:30:07,206
10 for this example.

971
00:30:07,936 --> 0:30:09,356
And direction, again, counter

972
00:30:09,356 --> 0:30:09,726
clockwise.

973
00:30:10,786 --> 0:30:12,776
Let's give that a try and yeah,

974
00:30:12,776 --> 0:30:13,316
that looks right.

975
00:30:13,986 --> 0:30:16,306
So now our action sequence is

976
00:30:16,306 --> 0:30:17,246
completely laid out.

977
00:30:17,486 --> 0:30:19,736
So, let's try to play the whole

978
00:30:19,736 --> 0:30:20,366
action sequence.

979
00:30:20,546 --> 0:30:21,636
And we can do that by just

980
00:30:21,716 --> 0:30:23,836
pressing play on the play button

981
00:30:23,836 --> 0:30:25,286
in the Action Sequence header.

982
00:30:26,816 --> 0:30:28,646
And what we see here is that

983
00:30:28,646 --> 0:30:29,816
only the Earth is moving.

984
00:30:30,166 --> 0:30:31,156
And that's because the action

985
00:30:31,156 --> 0:30:32,796
sequence is playing all the

986
00:30:32,796 --> 0:30:34,176
actions sequentially, one after

987
00:30:34,176 --> 0:30:34,606
the other.

988
00:30:35,276 --> 0:30:36,546
What we want to do here though

989
00:30:36,546 --> 0:30:39,006
is to make all these actions

990
00:30:39,006 --> 0:30:39,816
running parallel.

991
00:30:40,056 --> 0:30:41,636
And for that we can use drag and

992
00:30:41,636 --> 0:30:43,126
drop and drag the different

993
00:30:43,126 --> 0:30:44,336
cards on top of each other.

994
00:30:44,876 --> 0:30:47,446
And just by doing that, we

995
00:30:47,556 --> 0:30:49,076
create a group with the four

996
00:30:49,076 --> 0:30:49,496
actions.

997
00:30:50,296 --> 0:30:52,456
And now let's just go ahead and

998
00:30:52,456 --> 0:30:52,606
try [applause].

999
00:30:52,826 --> 0:30:54,976
Thanks.

[ Applause ]

1001
00:30:57,516 --> 0:30:58,726
So, now, let's go ahead and hit

1002
00:30:58,776 --> 0:31:01,336
play and see how all the

1003
00:30:58,776 --> 0:31:01,336
play and see how all the

1004
00:31:01,336 --> 0:31:02,306
behaviors play together.

1005
00:31:02,466 --> 0:31:04,496
And what we can see here is that

1006
00:31:04,496 --> 0:31:06,146
now all the orbit and spin

1007
00:31:06,146 --> 0:31:07,606
actions play together at the

1008
00:31:07,606 --> 0:31:09,106
same time as the text, and the

1009
00:31:09,106 --> 0:31:11,546
rays appear in the scene when

1010
00:31:11,616 --> 0:31:15,476
the Earth is passing by.

1011
00:31:16,516 --> 0:31:19,706
[ Applause ]

1012
00:31:20,206 --> 0:31:22,156
Okay. Let's go back to the

1013
00:31:22,156 --> 0:31:22,223
keynote.

1014
00:31:22,223 --> 0:31:24,786
So, that's how it easy it is to

1015
00:31:24,906 --> 0:31:26,566
bring some interactions and

1016
00:31:26,566 --> 0:31:28,186
behaviors to your scenes in

1017
00:31:28,186 --> 0:31:28,916
Reality Composer.

1018
00:31:29,676 --> 0:31:31,626
Now, let's move onto physics.

1019
00:31:31,726 --> 0:31:34,536
And so in order to create

1020
00:31:34,536 --> 0:31:36,056
amazing and immersive AR

1021
00:31:36,056 --> 0:31:37,856
experiences, you need your

1022
00:31:37,856 --> 0:31:39,816
objects to feed right into the

1023
00:31:39,816 --> 0:31:40,436
real world.

1024
00:31:40,916 --> 0:31:42,216
You need your objects to move

1025
00:31:42,216 --> 0:31:43,026
like real objects.

1026
00:31:43,166 --> 0:31:45,016
And for that, we need to take

1027
00:31:45,016 --> 0:31:46,636
advantage o this powerful

1028
00:31:46,706 --> 0:31:48,316
physics engine available to you

1029
00:31:48,316 --> 0:31:49,226
in Reality Composer.

1030
00:31:50,076 --> 0:31:51,986
So, let's take a look at it.

1031
00:31:52,536 --> 0:31:54,276
This is an example of a scene

1032
00:31:54,366 --> 0:31:55,306
that you can build in Reality

1033
00:31:55,306 --> 0:31:56,636
Composer using physics.

1034
00:31:57,346 --> 0:31:57,946
I use it here.

1035
00:31:58,286 --> 0:31:59,686
The sphere is falling because of

1036
00:31:59,686 --> 0:32:01,226
gravity, then it's colliding

1037
00:31:59,686 --> 0:32:01,226
gravity, then it's colliding

1038
00:32:01,226 --> 0:32:01,766
with the pins.

1039
00:32:02,166 --> 0:32:04,606
And right at the end, once it

1040
00:32:04,606 --> 0:32:05,896
bounces with the green box,

1041
00:32:06,376 --> 0:32:08,436
it's, we show this, like, winner

1042
00:32:08,526 --> 0:32:08,806
text.

1043
00:32:09,546 --> 0:32:11,326
So, let's see how we can build

1044
00:32:11,326 --> 0:32:11,976
this kind of scene.

1045
00:32:12,556 --> 0:32:14,896
There's three different ways

1046
00:32:14,896 --> 0:32:16,006
that you can influence the

1047
00:32:16,056 --> 0:32:17,586
physics simulation in your

1048
00:32:17,586 --> 0:32:17,916
scene.

1049
00:32:19,186 --> 0:32:20,736
A variety of materials will

1050
00:32:20,736 --> 0:32:22,306
define how your objects interact

1051
00:32:22,306 --> 0:32:23,536
with the scene and with other

1052
00:32:23,536 --> 0:32:24,026
objects.

1053
00:32:25,336 --> 0:32:26,376
With the force action and the

1054
00:32:26,376 --> 0:32:28,866
gravity, you can determine how

1055
00:32:28,866 --> 0:32:30,176
the forces will play into your

1056
00:32:30,176 --> 0:32:30,466
world.

1057
00:32:30,526 --> 0:32:32,856
And with the collision trigger

1058
00:32:33,346 --> 0:32:34,826
and the collision shapes, you

1059
00:32:34,826 --> 0:32:36,196
can define how the collision

1060
00:32:36,196 --> 0:32:37,986
mechanics will work in your

1061
00:32:37,986 --> 0:32:38,806
physics simulation.

1062
00:32:40,026 --> 0:32:41,476
So, let's start with materials.

1063
00:32:41,476 --> 0:32:44,036
In Reality Composer, there's six

1064
00:32:44,036 --> 0:32:45,186
different materials that you can

1065
00:32:45,186 --> 0:32:45,496
use.

1066
00:32:46,596 --> 0:32:48,216
You have to define the materials

1067
00:32:48,216 --> 0:32:49,496
for the scene and for the

1068
00:32:49,496 --> 0:32:50,026
objects.

1069
00:32:51,136 --> 0:32:52,756
So, let's say you use material

1070
00:32:52,856 --> 0:32:53,456
for your object.

1071
00:32:53,656 --> 0:32:55,326
Use ice as the material of your

1072
00:32:55,326 --> 0:32:55,536
object.

1073
00:32:55,976 --> 0:32:57,446
This will make your object slide

1074
00:32:57,446 --> 0:32:58,036
through the scene.

1075
00:32:58,626 --> 0:33:00,956
If you use rubber instead, your

1076
00:32:58,626 --> 0:33:00,956
If you use rubber instead, your

1077
00:33:00,956 --> 0:33:03,356
object will be much more bouncy.

1078
00:33:03,896 --> 0:33:08,746
Now, let's move onto forces.

1079
00:33:10,206 --> 0:33:11,716
All your scene will have gravity

1080
00:33:11,716 --> 0:33:14,346
enabled by default and the value

1081
00:33:14,346 --> 0:33:15,356
will be set to the Earth's

1082
00:33:15,356 --> 0:33:15,736
gravity.

1083
00:33:16,006 --> 0:33:17,346
But you can change that to any

1084
00:33:17,346 --> 0:33:17,966
value you want.

1085
00:33:18,526 --> 0:33:22,066
With the force action, you can

1086
00:33:22,066 --> 0:33:23,186
give your object an initial

1087
00:33:23,186 --> 0:33:23,676
impulse.

1088
00:33:24,256 --> 0:33:26,276
You define a direction, how much

1089
00:33:26,356 --> 0:33:27,716
velocity you want to give to the

1090
00:33:27,716 --> 0:33:27,966
object.

1091
00:33:28,326 --> 0:33:29,406
And you can build these kinds of

1092
00:33:29,406 --> 0:33:30,896
behaviors where you can add the

1093
00:33:30,896 --> 0:33:32,966
force once the user taps on the

1094
00:33:33,426 --> 0:33:33,686
object.

1095
00:33:35,676 --> 0:33:37,426
And now that your objects have

1096
00:33:37,426 --> 0:33:39,426
materials and can be affected by

1097
00:33:39,496 --> 0:33:42,106
forces, it's time to make them

1098
00:33:42,106 --> 0:33:42,886
collide with each other.

1099
00:33:43,526 --> 0:33:45,516
So, by default, in Reality

1100
00:33:45,516 --> 0:33:47,746
Composer, all the objects don't

1101
00:33:47,746 --> 0:33:49,066
participate in the physics

1102
00:33:49,066 --> 0:33:49,556
simulation.

1103
00:33:50,046 --> 0:33:51,426
If you want your objects to

1104
00:33:51,426 --> 0:33:52,986
collide with other objects, you

1105
00:33:52,986 --> 0:33:55,206
have to set the collide option.

1106
00:33:55,656 --> 0:33:57,886
If you want your objects to be

1107
00:33:57,886 --> 0:33:59,516
moved by the physics simulation,

1108
00:33:59,836 --> 0:34:01,586
you need to set the simulate

1109
00:33:59,836 --> 0:34:01,586
you need to set the simulate

1110
00:34:01,586 --> 0:34:01,936
option.

1111
00:34:02,616 --> 0:34:04,496
So, here you can see how default

1112
00:34:04,826 --> 0:34:06,596
collides and simulate options

1113
00:34:06,746 --> 0:34:08,786
affect the objects in the scene.

1114
00:34:09,516 --> 0:34:15,275
[ Applause ]

1115
00:34:15,775 --> 0:34:17,235
So, the collision mechanics are

1116
00:34:17,266 --> 0:34:18,886
determined by the shapes of the

1117
00:34:18,886 --> 0:34:19,636
object in a scene.

1118
00:34:20,366 --> 0:34:21,516
In Reality Composer, there's

1119
00:34:21,716 --> 0:34:23,166
three different shapes that you

1120
00:34:23,166 --> 0:34:23,556
can use.

1121
00:34:23,815 --> 0:34:25,956
And those are box, sphere, and

1122
00:34:25,956 --> 0:34:26,335
capsule.

1123
00:34:27,476 --> 0:34:28,936
Those shapes will determine how

1124
00:34:28,936 --> 0:34:30,815
your object moves in the scene

1125
00:34:30,815 --> 0:34:32,346
and how it collides with other

1126
00:34:32,346 --> 0:34:34,916
objects and the anchor.

1127
00:34:37,295 --> 0:34:39,116
And with the collide trigger,

1128
00:34:39,356 --> 0:34:40,266
you can build these kinds of

1129
00:34:40,266 --> 0:34:42,606
behaviors where here we have a

1130
00:34:42,656 --> 0:34:44,666
collide trigger with the sphere

1131
00:34:44,666 --> 0:34:45,335
and the box.

1132
00:34:45,335 --> 0:34:47,386
And that way we can detect when

1133
00:34:47,386 --> 0:34:49,096
the user is winning this game

1134
00:34:49,326 --> 0:34:50,565
and show the winner text.

1135
00:34:54,716 --> 0:34:56,456
And that's pretty much all we

1136
00:34:56,456 --> 0:34:57,666
have to say about physics in

1137
00:34:57,666 --> 0:34:58,396

00:34:59,326 --> 0:35:00,696
So now I would like to hand it

1139
00:34:59,326 --> 0:35:00,696
So now I would like to hand it

1140
00:35:00,696 --> 0:35:02,276
over to my colleague, Abhi, to

1141
00:35:02,276 --> 0:35:03,676
talk you through how to build

1145
00:35:11,266 --> 0:35:11,946
&gt;&gt; Hi everyone.

1146
00:35:11,946 --> 0:35:12,586
My name is Abhi.

1147
00:35:12,586 --> 0:35:13,816
I'm super excited to be here

1148
00:35:13,816 --> 0:35:14,236
today.

1149
00:35:14,236 --> 0:35:15,406
So, earlier in the session, we

1150
00:35:15,406 --> 0:35:17,296
saw how with Reality Composer we

1151
00:35:17,296 --> 0:35:18,736
can create amazing 3D

1152
00:35:18,736 --> 0:35:20,426
experiences and then bring it to

1153
00:35:20,426 --> 0:35:21,636
life with behaviors.

1154
00:35:22,036 --> 0:35:23,096
Now, let's see how we can take

1155
00:35:23,096 --> 0:35:24,746
those AR experiences and

1156
00:35:24,866 --> 0:35:27,616
integrate them into our app.

1157
00:35:27,616 --> 0:35:28,956
So to get started, we provide

1158
00:35:28,956 --> 0:35:29,586
three different ways.

1159
00:35:30,346 --> 0:35:32,056
The first is create a new

1160
00:35:32,146 --> 0:35:34,386
RealityKit AR or Game template

1161
00:35:34,386 --> 0:35:35,036
right in Xcode.

1162
00:35:36,106 --> 0:35:37,516
Then second is to create a new

1163
00:35:37,516 --> 0:35:39,166
project from Reality Composer.

1164
00:35:39,796 --> 0:35:41,076
And the third is to export a

1165
00:35:41,076 --> 0:35:42,926
Reality file from Reality

1166
00:35:42,926 --> 0:35:44,356
Composer and then include it

1167
00:35:44,356 --> 0:35:45,586
inside your app.

1168
00:35:46,596 --> 0:35:47,936
To get started, let's start

1169
00:35:47,936 --> 0:35:49,416
about the two essential files,

1170
00:35:49,506 --> 0:35:51,346
the Reality Composer project and

1171
00:35:51,346 --> 0:35:52,096
the Reality file.

1172
00:35:52,096 --> 0:35:53,806
And we'll get started by talking

1173
00:35:53,806 --> 0:35:54,736
about the Reality Composer

1174
00:35:54,736 --> 0:35:55,156
project.

1175
00:35:55,686 --> 0:35:58,296
So, this is the project file for

1176
00:35:58,296 --> 0:35:59,056
Reality Composer.

1177
00:35:59,726 --> 0:36:01,036
It's included automatically

1178
00:35:59,726 --> 0:36:01,036
It's included automatically

1179
00:36:01,316 --> 0:36:03,606
inside of RealityKit AR and Game

1180
00:36:03,606 --> 0:36:04,156
templates.

1181
00:36:04,776 --> 0:36:06,506
It's previewable right inside of

1182
00:36:06,506 --> 0:36:07,586
Xcode; we have Xcode

1183
00:36:07,586 --> 0:36:08,186
integration.

1184
00:36:08,846 --> 0:36:10,656
And Xcode automatically exports

1185
00:36:10,726 --> 0:36:12,486
your Reality Composer project as

1186
00:36:12,486 --> 0:36:14,026
a Reality file during the build

1187
00:36:14,376 --> 0:36:16,426
step of Xcode.

1188
00:36:16,576 --> 0:36:18,026
So, here we can see our Reality

1189
00:36:18,026 --> 0:36:18,886
Composer project.

1190
00:36:19,166 --> 0:36:20,596
In Xcode 11, we're able to

1191
00:36:20,596 --> 0:36:21,906
preview it and we're able to

1192
00:36:21,906 --> 0:36:23,176
preview each of our scenes as

1193
00:36:23,176 --> 0:36:23,476
well.

1194
00:36:23,476 --> 0:36:25,266
And in the upper right-hand

1195
00:36:25,266 --> 0:36:26,356
corner, we can see an Open in

1196
00:36:26,356 --> 0:36:27,816
Reality Composer button, and

1197
00:36:27,816 --> 0:36:28,636
this will launch Reality

1198
00:36:28,636 --> 0:36:30,236
Composer right from Xcode.

1199
00:36:30,236 --> 0:36:33,736
As I mentioned earlier, if you

1200
00:36:33,736 --> 0:36:35,326
have a Reality Composer project

1201
00:36:35,396 --> 0:36:37,216
in your Xcode application during

1202
00:36:37,216 --> 0:36:38,966
the build step, we automatically

1203
00:36:38,966 --> 0:36:40,776
generate a Reality file for you.

1204
00:36:40,776 --> 0:36:42,456
And it's included inside of your

1205
00:36:42,456 --> 0:36:44,066
application, just like any other

1206
00:36:44,066 --> 0:36:44,526
resource.

1207
00:36:44,526 --> 0:36:46,046
You can access it exactly the

1208
00:36:46,046 --> 0:36:46,516
same way.

1209
00:36:47,246 --> 0:36:48,556
So, what is a Reality file?

1210
00:36:48,946 --> 0:36:50,906
This is a central object for how

1211
00:36:50,906 --> 0:36:52,746
you will use your application

1212
00:36:52,746 --> 0:36:53,576
and work with your AR

1213
00:36:53,576 --> 0:36:54,046
experience.

1214
00:36:54,046 --> 0:36:55,656
It contains all the data

1215
00:36:55,656 --> 0:36:57,796
required for rendering and

1216
00:36:57,796 --> 0:36:59,586
simulation, and it's optimized

1217
00:36:59,586 --> 0:37:00,326
for RealityKit.

1218
00:36:59,586 --> 0:37:00,326
for RealityKit.

1219
00:37:01,166 --> 0:37:01,986
Like I said earlier, it's

1220
00:37:01,986 --> 0:37:03,646
exported from Reality Composer

1221
00:37:04,086 --> 0:37:05,556
or it's automatically exported

1222
00:37:05,626 --> 0:37:07,286
by Xcode during the build step

1223
00:37:07,286 --> 0:37:07,936
of your project.

1224
00:37:08,346 --> 0:37:10,946
You can use a Reality file

1225
00:37:11,086 --> 0:37:12,236
either by referencing it

1226
00:37:12,236 --> 0:37:14,316
directly in your application or

1227
00:37:14,316 --> 0:37:15,636
previewing it in AR Quick Look,

1228
00:37:15,636 --> 0:37:17,406
and we encourage you guys to go

1229
00:37:17,406 --> 0:37:18,536
check out the Advances in AR

1230
00:37:18,536 --> 0:37:20,486
Quick Look session tomorrow to

1231
00:37:20,546 --> 0:37:21,926
learn more about that.

1232
00:37:23,016 --> 0:37:24,726
Diving a little bit deeper, what

1233
00:37:24,726 --> 0:37:25,886
is a Reality file?

1234
00:37:26,386 --> 0:37:27,526
So because this is a file

1235
00:37:27,526 --> 0:37:29,016
exported from Reality Composer,

1236
00:37:29,626 --> 0:37:30,956
it'll contain each of the scenes

1237
00:37:30,956 --> 0:37:32,476
that you've created in Reality

1238
00:37:32,476 --> 0:37:33,146
Composer.

1239
00:37:33,146 --> 0:37:34,196
For example, we have two scenes

1240
00:37:34,196 --> 0:37:36,646
here, and it also contains every

1241
00:37:36,646 --> 0:37:38,376
object that you've created in

1242
00:37:38,376 --> 0:37:39,076
the application.

1243
00:37:39,076 --> 0:37:41,656
When we think about a scene in a

1244
00:37:41,656 --> 0:37:43,186
Reality file, we consider a

1245
00:37:43,186 --> 0:37:44,966
scene an anchor, an anchor

1246
00:37:44,966 --> 0:37:46,066
entity, specifically.

1247
00:37:46,496 --> 0:37:47,796
So, this contains for example

1248
00:37:47,796 --> 0:37:48,746
the horizontal anchor

1249
00:37:48,746 --> 0:37:50,436
information that you set up in

1250
00:37:50,436 --> 0:37:51,186
Reality Composer.

1251
00:37:55,916 --> 0:37:57,396
So, we thought one of the

1252
00:37:57,396 --> 0:37:59,396
biggest difficulties in working

1253
00:37:59,396 --> 0:38:01,806
with Reality files was being

1254
00:37:59,396 --> 0:38:01,806
with Reality files was being

1255
00:38:01,806 --> 0:38:02,916
able to access things with

1256
00:38:02,916 --> 0:38:03,486
strings.

1257
00:38:03,486 --> 0:38:05,426
And we both have the Reality

1258
00:38:05,426 --> 0:38:07,316
Composer project and Xcode.

1259
00:38:07,726 --> 0:38:09,326
So, we wanted to introduce a way

1260
00:38:09,326 --> 0:38:11,016
to make this very easy to work

1261
00:38:11,066 --> 0:38:12,296
with, almost like just an

1262
00:38:12,296 --> 0:38:12,716
object.

1263
00:38:13,066 --> 0:38:14,326
And so we decided to do that

1264
00:38:14,326 --> 0:38:15,916
with code generation in Xcode.

1265
00:38:16,756 --> 0:38:18,266
What code generation will do is

1266
00:38:18,266 --> 0:38:19,646
analyze the structure of your

1267
00:38:19,646 --> 0:38:21,726
Reality Composer project and

1268
00:38:21,726 --> 0:38:22,966
generate an object, a real

1269
00:38:22,966 --> 0:38:24,286
object that you can use inside

1270
00:38:24,286 --> 0:38:24,996
of your application.

1271
00:38:25,346 --> 0:38:26,966
So for example here, we have our

1272
00:38:26,966 --> 0:38:28,796
Solar System Reality Composer

1273
00:38:28,796 --> 0:38:30,596
project, and we automatically

1274
00:38:30,596 --> 0:38:32,316
generate a Solar System object

1275
00:38:32,316 --> 0:38:34,466
that you can use in your app.

1276
00:38:39,976 --> 0:38:41,516
So, the code generated for you

1277
00:38:41,516 --> 0:38:43,416
is an application-specific API

1278
00:38:44,456 --> 0:38:46,206
for your scenes, for your named

1279
00:38:46,206 --> 0:38:47,636
entities that Michelle mentioned

1280
00:38:47,636 --> 0:38:50,796
earlier, for notify actions, and

1281
00:38:50,796 --> 0:38:51,826
for notification triggers.

1282
00:38:51,956 --> 0:38:52,976
And we'll get to the second,

1283
00:38:52,976 --> 0:38:54,956
those last two items later in

1284
00:38:55,856 --> 0:38:57,066
the session.

1285
00:38:57,226 --> 0:38:58,396
The first step to get started

1286
00:38:58,396 --> 0:38:59,696
with code generation and working

1287
00:38:59,696 --> 0:39:01,286
with your AR experience is to

1288
00:38:59,696 --> 0:39:01,286
with your AR experience is to

1289
00:39:01,286 --> 0:39:02,566
give names to everything you

1290
00:39:02,566 --> 0:39:04,266
care about and one axis in code

1291
00:39:04,626 --> 0:39:05,756
right in Reality Composer.

1292
00:39:06,086 --> 0:39:07,126
And you can do that here in the

1293
00:39:07,196 --> 0:39:08,936
Settings pane under Configure.

1294
00:39:08,936 --> 0:39:10,296
So for example here we've given

1295
00:39:10,296 --> 0:39:13,036
the Sun, our Sun USDZ that we

1296
00:39:13,036 --> 0:39:14,676
imported, the name Sun.

1297
00:39:14,756 --> 0:39:16,236
And we'll use this name to

1298
00:39:16,236 --> 0:39:17,086
access it in code.

1299
00:39:17,726 --> 0:39:20,086
So, how does our Reality

1300
00:39:20,086 --> 0:39:21,656
Composer project get converted

1301
00:39:21,906 --> 0:39:24,126
into an object that we can use?

1302
00:39:24,756 --> 0:39:26,396
At the top level, our Reality

1303
00:39:26,396 --> 0:39:28,516
Composer project becomes, for

1304
00:39:28,516 --> 0:39:30,166
example, solarsystem.swift.

1305
00:39:30,926 --> 0:39:33,146
Our scene becomes an entity that

1306
00:39:33,146 --> 0:39:33,806
has anchoring.

1307
00:39:33,806 --> 0:39:35,046
And this is really important,

1308
00:39:35,046 --> 0:39:35,996
because it means when you load

1309
00:39:35,996 --> 0:39:37,166
it, you can add it right into

1310
00:39:37,166 --> 0:39:38,426
your scene's anchors.

1311
00:39:39,426 --> 0:39:40,986
Additionally, any objects you

1312
00:39:40,986 --> 0:39:42,416
set up get converted into

1313
00:39:42,416 --> 0:39:42,826
entities.

1314
00:39:43,036 --> 0:39:44,296
These are real RealityKit

1315
00:39:44,296 --> 0:39:45,306
entities that you can use.

1316
00:39:45,306 --> 0:39:46,366
You can work with exactly the

1317
00:39:46,366 --> 0:39:46,896
same way.

1318
00:39:47,926 --> 0:39:50,216
In addition, we also provide two

1319
00:39:50,216 --> 0:39:51,186
different ways to load your

1320
00:39:51,186 --> 0:39:51,756
scene.

1321
00:39:51,946 --> 0:39:53,716
One that is synchronous and one

1322
00:39:53,716 --> 0:39:54,676
that is asynchronous.

1323
00:39:55,246 --> 0:39:58,626
So, taking a look at loading a

1324
00:39:58,626 --> 0:40:00,876
Reality file synchronously, here

1325
00:39:58,626 --> 0:40:00,876
Reality file synchronously, here

1326
00:40:00,876 --> 0:40:02,826
we have our solar system as our

1327
00:40:02,826 --> 0:40:04,336
example again and we'd like to

1328
00:40:04,336 --> 0:40:05,566
load the seasonsChapter.

1329
00:40:05,566 --> 0:40:07,556
And we can do that with a single

1330
00:40:07,556 --> 0:40:07,896
line of code.

1331
00:40:07,896 --> 0:40:10,826
So, we can say solarsystem.load

1332
00:40:10,826 --> 0:40:11,536
seasons chapter.

1333
00:40:11,636 --> 0:40:13,046
And we'll get returned an anchor

1334
00:40:13,046 --> 0:40:14,196
that we can then add into our

1335
00:40:14,196 --> 0:40:14,586
view.

1336
00:40:14,686 --> 0:40:15,536
It's super simple.

1337
00:40:17,296 --> 0:40:19,316
Next, if we want to load our

1338
00:40:19,316 --> 0:40:20,806
seasonschapter asynchronously or

1339
00:40:20,806 --> 0:40:22,746
any scene, we can use for

1340
00:40:22,746 --> 0:40:24,896
example the solarsystem.load

1341
00:40:24,896 --> 0:40:26,736
seasons chapter async, and we'll

1342
00:40:26,736 --> 0:40:27,726
get a result object.

1343
00:40:27,836 --> 0:40:29,206
And we can handle the success

1344
00:40:29,206 --> 0:40:29,476
case.

1345
00:40:29,956 --> 0:40:30,696
We'll get the anchor.

1346
00:40:30,696 --> 0:40:32,716
Or we can handle the failure

1347
00:40:32,716 --> 0:40:34,166
case, and display the error to

1348
00:40:34,166 --> 0:40:34,556
the user.

1349
00:40:35,116 --> 0:40:37,566
In addition, if we want to

1350
00:40:37,566 --> 0:40:38,876
access the named entities in our

1351
00:40:38,876 --> 0:40:41,056
scene, we can do so as easily as

1352
00:40:41,056 --> 0:40:44,036
calling for example seasons.sun,

1353
00:40:44,036 --> 0:40:45,136
.earth, and .moon.

1354
00:40:45,436 --> 0:40:46,576
And this will give us access to

1355
00:40:46,576 --> 0:40:47,846
the entity that we named in

1356
00:40:47,846 --> 0:40:48,596
Reality Composer.

1357
00:40:48,946 --> 0:40:49,996
It's just like working with any

1358
00:40:49,996 --> 0:40:50,556
other object.

1359
00:40:51,796 --> 0:40:53,466
So, putting it all together with

1360
00:40:53,466 --> 0:40:55,236
code generation in Xcode and

1361
00:40:55,236 --> 0:40:57,286
Reality Composer, we can load

1362
00:40:57,286 --> 0:40:58,356
our AR experience in our

1363
00:40:58,356 --> 0:41:00,146
application with just two lines

1364
00:40:58,356 --> 0:41:00,146
application with just two lines

1365
00:41:00,146 --> 0:41:00,506
of code.

1366
00:41:01,396 --> 0:41:03,186
The first is loading our chapter

1367
00:41:03,286 --> 0:41:05,046
or loading our scene, and the

1368
00:41:05,046 --> 0:41:06,916
second is adding it right into

1369
00:41:06,916 --> 0:41:07,426
our view.

1370
00:41:07,586 --> 0:41:09,886
It's super easy.

1371
00:41:10,516 --> 0:41:15,416
[ Applause ]

1372
00:41:15,916 --> 0:41:17,886
So, that's code generation in

1373
00:41:17,886 --> 0:41:18,356
Xcode.

1374
00:41:18,776 --> 0:41:20,196
We also provide a way to access

1375
00:41:20,196 --> 0:41:21,046
your Reality file.

1376
00:41:21,046 --> 0:41:22,356
For example, in cases where

1377
00:41:22,356 --> 0:41:23,736
you're downloading content off

1378
00:41:23,736 --> 0:41:24,966
of a server and you want to

1379
00:41:24,966 --> 0:41:25,746
display that in your

1380
00:41:25,746 --> 0:41:28,036
application, to do that, we have

1381
00:41:28,136 --> 0:41:29,256
RealityKit API.

1382
00:41:29,896 --> 0:41:31,286
So, to load a Reality file

1383
00:41:31,286 --> 0:41:33,136
synchronously, you first need to

1384
00:41:33,136 --> 0:41:34,906
get the URL just like any other

1385
00:41:34,906 --> 0:41:35,946
resource in your application

1386
00:41:35,946 --> 0:41:36,206
bundle.

1387
00:41:36,206 --> 0:41:40,706
And next, using the entity.load

1388
00:41:40,706 --> 0:41:42,586
anchor method, passing the URL

1389
00:41:42,586 --> 0:41:44,146
of the resource, and the name of

1390
00:41:44,146 --> 0:41:45,016
the scene that you'd like to

1391
00:41:45,016 --> 0:41:46,626
load, and this will give you

1392
00:41:46,626 --> 0:41:47,926
back an anchor that you can use.

1393
00:41:48,306 --> 0:41:49,716
Optionally, you can also use

1394
00:41:49,716 --> 0:41:51,506
entity.load which will load the

1395
00:41:51,506 --> 0:41:53,216
entity tree without the anchor

1396
00:41:53,216 --> 0:41:53,716
information.

1397
00:41:54,916 --> 0:41:56,496
To load your Reality file

1398
00:41:56,496 --> 0:41:57,806
asynchronously, there's also a

1399
00:41:57,806 --> 0:41:58,986
way to do that.

1400
00:41:58,986 --> 0:41:59,966
So the first step is exactly the

1401
00:41:59,966 --> 0:42:00,286
same.

1402
00:41:59,966 --> 0:42:00,286
same.

1403
00:42:00,656 --> 0:42:02,806
Just get the URL resource of the

1404
00:42:02,806 --> 0:42:03,166
resource.

1405
00:42:04,256 --> 0:42:06,276
Use entity.load anchor async,

1406
00:42:06,436 --> 0:42:07,976
passing in the URL and the name

1407
00:42:07,976 --> 0:42:08,766
of the scene that you'd like to

1408
00:42:08,766 --> 0:42:09,126
load.

1409
00:42:09,606 --> 0:42:10,556
This will give you a load

1410
00:42:10,556 --> 0:42:11,076
request.

1411
00:42:11,076 --> 0:42:12,886
And using the new combined

1412
00:42:12,886 --> 0:42:14,726
framework, we can receive a

1413
00:42:14,726 --> 0:42:16,396
completion and then receive the

1414
00:42:16,396 --> 0:42:17,856
value, and the value contains

1415
00:42:17,856 --> 0:42:18,916
the anchor that we'd like to

1416
00:42:18,916 --> 0:42:19,086
load.

1417
00:42:19,086 --> 0:42:20,366
So, you can put this right into

1418
00:42:20,366 --> 0:42:21,126
your AR view scene.

1419
00:42:21,456 --> 0:42:23,866
Accessing entities.

1420
00:42:23,866 --> 0:42:25,026
You can do this through

1421
00:42:25,026 --> 0:42:27,686
anchor.find entity, and then

1422
00:42:27,686 --> 0:42:29,006
passing the name of the object

1423
00:42:29,006 --> 0:42:29,916
that you'd like to load.

1424
00:42:29,916 --> 0:42:31,906
For example, Sun, Earth, and

1425
00:42:31,906 --> 0:42:32,236
Moon.

1426
00:42:33,006 --> 0:42:34,546
So, that's how easy it is with

1427
00:42:34,596 --> 0:42:35,806
code generation in Xcode with

1428
00:42:35,806 --> 0:42:37,686
the RealityKit to bring your AR

1429
00:42:37,686 --> 0:42:38,686
experiences into your

1430
00:42:38,686 --> 0:42:39,076
application.

1431
00:42:39,626 --> 0:42:42,806
So, next, let's talk about how

1432
00:42:42,806 --> 0:42:44,626
our application can interact

1433
00:42:44,846 --> 0:42:45,786
with our AR content.

1434
00:42:46,086 --> 0:42:47,046
We can create amazing

1435
00:42:47,046 --> 0:42:48,646
experiences right inside of

1436
00:42:48,646 --> 0:42:50,016
Reality Composer, but how do we

1437
00:42:50,016 --> 0:42:50,906
actually work with it?

1438
00:42:51,206 --> 0:42:52,936
So, as Pau mentioned earlier, we

1439
00:42:52,936 --> 0:42:54,446
have a great built-in set of

1440
00:42:54,446 --> 0:42:56,076
actions already for you, but

1441
00:42:56,076 --> 0:42:56,976
there might be actions that you

1442
00:42:56,976 --> 0:42:58,126
want to define yourself.

1443
00:42:58,666 --> 0:43:00,336
So to do that, we've created the

1444
00:42:58,666 --> 0:43:00,336
So to do that, we've created the

1445
00:43:00,336 --> 0:43:01,226
notify action.

1446
00:43:01,746 --> 0:43:03,506
This is an action that you set

1447
00:43:03,506 --> 0:43:04,516
up in Reality Composer.

1448
00:43:05,156 --> 0:43:08,536
It's called alongside your other

1449
00:43:08,536 --> 0:43:10,476
action sequences, exactly in the

1450
00:43:10,476 --> 0:43:11,056
same order.

1451
00:43:11,056 --> 0:43:12,296
For example, if it's sequenced,

1452
00:43:12,566 --> 0:43:13,486
it'll be called in that

1453
00:43:13,536 --> 0:43:13,966
sequence.

1454
00:43:15,346 --> 0:43:16,566
There's a settable closure in

1455
00:43:16,566 --> 0:43:17,746
your application code, so you

1456
00:43:17,746 --> 0:43:19,696
can define the implementation of

1457
00:43:19,696 --> 0:43:20,186
this action.

1458
00:43:21,546 --> 0:43:22,716
And just like accessing an

1459
00:43:22,716 --> 0:43:24,026
entity through code generation,

1460
00:43:24,516 --> 0:43:26,096
the Notify action is also

1461
00:43:26,096 --> 0:43:29,066
accessible through your object.

1462
00:43:29,856 --> 0:43:31,786
So, in Reality Composer, we can

1463
00:43:31,786 --> 0:43:33,296
set up a notify action here and

1464
00:43:33,656 --> 0:43:36,016
we can give it an identifier.

1465
00:43:36,016 --> 0:43:37,566
This is the identifier we'll use

1466
00:43:37,636 --> 0:43:39,356
in code to reference our notify

1467
00:43:39,356 --> 0:43:40,836
action and provide a custom

1468
00:43:40,836 --> 0:43:41,436
implementation.

1469
00:43:41,996 --> 0:43:45,496
In the structure of our

1470
00:43:46,036 --> 0:43:48,226
generated object, the actions

1471
00:43:48,226 --> 0:43:49,536
lives alongside your energies

1472
00:43:49,696 --> 0:43:50,986
inside of the scene object.

1473
00:43:51,746 --> 0:43:53,106
So here we have actions and a

1474
00:43:53,106 --> 0:43:54,236
property actions.

1475
00:43:55,406 --> 0:43:56,796
Inside of the actions class,

1476
00:43:57,126 --> 0:43:58,216
you'll see multiple notify

1477
00:43:58,216 --> 0:43:59,906
actions that have the name of

1478
00:43:59,906 --> 0:44:01,106
the identifier you've given your

1479
00:43:59,906 --> 0:44:01,106
the identifier you've given your

1480
00:44:01,106 --> 0:44:01,696
notify action.

1481
00:44:02,086 --> 0:44:03,486
So you can access these as

1482
00:44:03,486 --> 0:44:04,866
simply as the loaded

1483
00:44:04,866 --> 0:44:07,186
anchor.actions and then the name

1484
00:44:07,186 --> 0:44:07,916
of the action that you care

1485
00:44:07,916 --> 0:44:08,146
about.

1486
00:44:08,566 --> 0:44:09,946
In addition, we also generate an

1487
00:44:09,946 --> 0:44:11,676
all actions array, so you can do

1488
00:44:11,676 --> 0:44:12,616
great things with this, just

1489
00:44:12,616 --> 0:44:13,506
like any other collection in

1490
00:44:13,506 --> 0:44:13,856
Swift.

1491
00:44:14,126 --> 0:44:15,086
You can filter over it, you can

1492
00:44:15,086 --> 0:44:15,746
iterate over it.

1493
00:44:15,746 --> 0:44:16,956
Anything you can do with an

1494
00:44:16,956 --> 0:44:18,506
array in Swift, you can do with

1495
00:44:18,506 --> 0:44:19,436
this all actions property.

1496
00:44:20,106 --> 0:44:22,306
To actually set the

1497
00:44:22,306 --> 0:44:23,626
implementation of a notify

1498
00:44:23,626 --> 0:44:25,846
action, you first need to access

1499
00:44:25,846 --> 0:44:26,956
it through your Alert anchor.

1500
00:44:27,356 --> 0:44:28,286
So, for example here,

1501
00:44:28,646 --> 0:44:31,716
seasonschapter.actions .display

1502
00:44:31,716 --> 0:44:33,826
Earth details, and then provide

1503
00:44:33,826 --> 0:44:34,586
the custom closer.

1504
00:44:34,796 --> 0:44:35,866
So .onaction.

1505
00:44:36,396 --> 0:44:37,526
And the entity that you'll get

1506
00:44:37,526 --> 0:44:38,866
returned inside of this closure

1507
00:44:39,226 --> 0:44:40,706
is the target entity you set up

1508
00:44:40,706 --> 0:44:41,546
in Reality Composer.

1509
00:44:42,096 --> 0:44:45,826
On the other side, to actually

1510
00:44:45,826 --> 0:44:47,736
kick off action sequences and

1511
00:44:47,736 --> 0:44:48,676
provide a way to do this as

1512
00:44:48,676 --> 0:44:50,406
well, we have a couple of great

1513
00:44:50,406 --> 0:44:52,166
built-in triggers such as Scene

1514
00:44:52,166 --> 0:44:53,346
Start and Proximity.

1515
00:44:53,656 --> 0:44:54,846
But there might be times you

1516
00:44:54,846 --> 0:44:56,636
want to provide custom triggers.

1517
00:44:56,636 --> 0:44:58,156
For example, selecting a segment

1518
00:44:58,156 --> 0:44:59,486
of control or tapping on a

1519
00:44:59,486 --> 0:44:59,726
button.

1520
00:44:59,996 --> 0:45:01,436
And for that, we're providing

1521
00:44:59,996 --> 0:45:01,436
And for that, we're providing

1522
00:45:01,676 --> 0:45:02,726
the Notification Trigger.

1523
00:45:03,846 --> 0:45:05,286
So Notification Trigger is set

1524
00:45:05,286 --> 0:45:06,456
up in Reality Composer.

1525
00:45:07,336 --> 0:45:09,016
It starts an action sequence or

1526
00:45:09,016 --> 0:45:10,396
multiple sequences that have the

1527
00:45:10,396 --> 0:45:11,216
same identifier.

1528
00:45:12,666 --> 0:45:13,896
It's posted from the runtime of

1529
00:45:13,896 --> 0:45:14,546
your application.

1530
00:45:15,256 --> 0:45:16,606
And it's accessible just like a

1531
00:45:16,606 --> 0:45:18,246
Notify Action and acts as your

1532
00:45:18,246 --> 0:45:20,366
entities just by name in your

1533
00:45:20,366 --> 0:45:20,636
code.

1534
00:45:20,636 --> 0:45:23,416
You can set up a notification

1535
00:45:23,416 --> 0:45:24,806
trigger right inside of your

1536
00:45:24,806 --> 0:45:26,816
behavior and here we have given

1537
00:45:26,816 --> 0:45:28,536
it the identifier show gold

1538
00:45:28,536 --> 0:45:28,846
star.

1539
00:45:29,256 --> 0:45:30,466
And we'll use this name in code.

1540
00:45:30,466 --> 0:45:33,916
Just like actions, it lives

1541
00:45:33,916 --> 0:45:35,536
right alongside your entities in

1542
00:45:35,536 --> 0:45:38,846
the generated code inside of a

1543
00:45:38,846 --> 0:45:41,516
new notifications object class.

1544
00:45:42,976 --> 0:45:44,266
And inside of Notifications,

1545
00:45:44,266 --> 0:45:45,546
just like Notify Actions, you'll

1546
00:45:45,546 --> 0:45:46,886
have Notification Triggers

1547
00:45:47,246 --> 0:45:48,506
corresponding to the names, the

1548
00:45:48,506 --> 0:45:49,806
identifiers that you've given to

1549
00:45:49,806 --> 0:45:51,476
those Notification Triggers in

1550
00:45:51,476 --> 0:45:52,276
Reality Composer.

1551
00:45:52,626 --> 0:45:53,856
And just like Notify Actions,

1552
00:45:54,076 --> 0:45:54,986
you have an array that you can

1553
00:45:54,986 --> 0:45:56,396
filter over it or iterate over

1554
00:45:56,396 --> 0:45:56,696
as well.

1555
00:45:57,746 --> 0:45:59,196
That's called all notifications.

1556
00:45:59,726 --> 0:46:02,536
You can post a Notification

1557
00:45:59,726 --> 0:46:02,536
You can post a Notification

1558
00:46:02,536 --> 0:46:04,946
Trigger by calling the post

1559
00:46:04,946 --> 0:46:06,246
method, and this will fire an

1560
00:46:06,286 --> 0:46:07,696
action sequence or sequences

1561
00:46:07,696 --> 0:46:08,436
with the same name.

1562
00:46:09,296 --> 0:46:10,556
And you can also pass in an

1563
00:46:10,556 --> 0:46:11,566
optional override set.

1564
00:46:12,106 --> 0:46:13,056
This is really powerful for

1565
00:46:13,056 --> 0:46:14,266
cases where you want to copy an

1566
00:46:14,266 --> 0:46:16,206
entity and dynamically call an

1567
00:46:16,206 --> 0:46:18,066
action sequence on only the new

1568
00:46:18,066 --> 0:46:18,476
entity.

1569
00:46:19,106 --> 0:46:20,686
The overrides will take as a key

1570
00:46:20,686 --> 0:46:22,006
the name of the original target

1571
00:46:22,006 --> 0:46:23,546
of the action in Reality

1572
00:46:23,546 --> 0:46:25,106
Composer, and then you pass in

1573
00:46:25,106 --> 0:46:25,766
the new target.

1574
00:46:25,766 --> 0:46:26,716
So when the action sequence

1575
00:46:26,716 --> 0:46:28,846
runs, it only targets the new

1576
00:46:28,846 --> 0:46:29,176
entity.

1577
00:46:29,626 --> 0:46:31,806
So, let's pull this all together

1578
00:46:31,806 --> 0:46:34,906
and let's check it out in Xcode.

1579
00:46:35,516 --> 0:46:39,500
[ Applause ]

1580
00:46:47,176 --> 0:46:49,066
So, here I have my application.

1581
00:46:49,066 --> 0:46:50,546
Over the course of the session,

1582
00:46:50,546 --> 0:46:52,156
Pau and Michelle have built up

1583
00:46:52,416 --> 0:46:54,286
the Seasons chapter of our Solar

1584
00:46:54,286 --> 0:46:54,986
System lesson.

1585
00:46:55,346 --> 0:46:56,536
And here I want to implement a

1586
00:46:56,536 --> 0:46:58,036
second chapter based on the

1587
00:46:58,036 --> 0:46:59,226
sizes of different celestial

1588
00:46:59,226 --> 0:46:59,646
bodies.

1589
00:46:59,966 --> 0:47:01,826
So here we have our Xcode 11,

1590
00:46:59,966 --> 0:47:01,826
So here we have our Xcode 11,

1591
00:47:01,826 --> 0:47:03,906
just our base application, and

1592
00:47:03,906 --> 0:47:04,876
we have already included our

1593
00:47:04,876 --> 0:47:05,966
Reality Composer project.

1594
00:47:05,966 --> 0:47:07,646
Again, you can create a new AR

1595
00:47:07,646 --> 0:47:09,266
or Game template or you can drag

1596
00:47:09,266 --> 0:47:10,616
a Reality Composer project right

1597
00:47:10,616 --> 0:47:11,756
into Xcode.

1598
00:47:12,296 --> 0:47:16,726
We can preview the project right

1599
00:47:16,726 --> 0:47:19,106
in Xcode here and go ahead and

1600
00:47:19,106 --> 0:47:20,286
open it in Reality Composer.

1601
00:47:20,926 --> 0:47:25,436
Let's take a quick tour of this

1602
00:47:25,436 --> 0:47:26,696
and the application before

1603
00:47:26,696 --> 0:47:27,356
writing some code.

1604
00:47:28,346 --> 0:47:29,866
So, in our chapter we've set up

1605
00:47:29,866 --> 0:47:31,876
a couple of entities and we've

1606
00:47:31,876 --> 0:47:33,336
given our scene a name and we've

1607
00:47:33,336 --> 0:47:34,886
given different entities that we

1608
00:47:34,886 --> 0:47:35,486
care about a name.

1609
00:47:35,486 --> 0:47:36,786
For example this gold star is

1610
00:47:36,786 --> 0:47:37,706
called special star.

1611
00:47:38,026 --> 0:47:39,496
This is the name we'll use in

1612
00:47:40,396 --> 0:47:41,206
our code.

1613
00:47:41,416 --> 0:47:42,266
Additionally, we've set up a

1614
00:47:42,266 --> 0:47:43,196
couple of behaviors.

1615
00:47:43,196 --> 0:47:45,856
So for example, for the Moon, we

1616
00:47:45,856 --> 0:47:46,826
want to know when the Moon is

1617
00:47:46,826 --> 0:47:47,926
tapped so we can store some

1618
00:47:47,926 --> 0:47:50,986
application state, and also hide

1619
00:47:51,546 --> 0:47:53,266
all the other text labels and

1620
00:47:53,266 --> 0:47:55,166
only display the Moon's labels.

1621
00:47:55,166 --> 0:47:56,196
And all of these actions happen

1622
00:47:56,196 --> 0:47:57,246
at the same time because they're

1623
00:47:57,246 --> 0:47:58,000
grouped.

1624
00:47:59,126 --> 0:48:00,256
Additionally, we have a notify

1625
00:47:59,126 --> 0:48:00,256
Additionally, we have a notify

1626
00:48:00,256 --> 0:48:01,736
action and we'll use this to

1627
00:48:01,736 --> 0:48:02,756
know when the Moon is tapped

1628
00:48:02,756 --> 0:48:03,876
inside of our application.

1629
00:48:04,756 --> 0:48:05,816
We've implemented the same

1630
00:48:05,816 --> 0:48:07,336
action sequence for the Earth

1631
00:48:07,416 --> 0:48:08,306
and the Sun as well.

1632
00:48:09,416 --> 0:48:10,646
We also have a Look At camera

1633
00:48:10,646 --> 0:48:11,866
action set up when the scene

1634
00:48:11,866 --> 0:48:13,646
starts, so each of our text

1635
00:48:13,646 --> 0:48:15,826
labels will look at the camera

1636
00:48:15,826 --> 0:48:16,816
no matter where we're looking.

1637
00:48:17,376 --> 0:48:20,096
And we have a hide on start

1638
00:48:20,096 --> 0:48:22,096
action sequence which will hide

1639
00:48:22,096 --> 0:48:23,316
all the entities that we want to

1640
00:48:23,316 --> 0:48:24,866
view only at specific times.

1641
00:48:24,866 --> 0:48:25,726
For example, the chapter

1642
00:48:25,726 --> 0:48:28,646
completed, text, and the text

1643
00:48:29,616 --> 0:48:29,846
labels.

1644
00:48:29,936 --> 0:48:31,046
Additionally, we have some

1645
00:48:31,046 --> 0:48:32,326
action sequences that will be

1646
00:48:32,326 --> 0:48:33,206
triggered in code.

1647
00:48:33,206 --> 0:48:34,896
We'll get to this later in this

1648
00:48:34,896 --> 0:48:36,746
demo, that will scale the

1649
00:48:36,746 --> 0:48:37,726
celestial bodies to their

1650
00:48:37,726 --> 0:48:40,366
relative sizes, scale them back

1651
00:48:40,506 --> 0:48:41,456
to the same size.

1652
00:48:42,366 --> 0:48:44,286
Display the chapter completed

1653
00:48:45,296 --> 0:48:45,756
text.

1654
00:48:46,066 --> 0:48:47,156
Begin the Earth orbit.

1655
00:48:47,416 --> 0:48:48,766
And hide all of the other

1656
00:48:48,766 --> 0:48:49,616
celestial bodies.

1657
00:48:50,426 --> 0:48:51,396
And we have a cool little

1658
00:48:51,396 --> 0:48:53,116
animation fired from a

1659
00:48:53,116 --> 0:48:56,056
notification trigger that will

1660
00:48:56,056 --> 0:48:58,066
show the gold star, spin it, and

1661
00:48:58,066 --> 0:48:58,726
give it a bounce.

1662
00:49:00,046 --> 0:49:01,366
So let's jump back to our Xcode

1663
00:49:01,366 --> 0:49:03,746
application now and do a quick

1664
00:49:03,746 --> 0:49:03,946
tour.

1665
00:49:04,106 --> 0:49:05,466
So this application is pretty

1666
00:49:05,466 --> 0:49:05,976
straightforward.

1667
00:49:06,206 --> 0:49:07,516
It's a single view application.

1668
00:49:08,026 --> 0:49:10,356
And at the top level we have an

1669
00:49:10,356 --> 0:49:12,976
AR view, a segmented control to

1670
00:49:12,976 --> 0:49:15,676
switch between size and detail

1671
00:49:17,166 --> 0:49:18,466
view, a lesson completed button,

1672
00:49:18,466 --> 0:49:19,636
so the student can just say I'm

1673
00:49:19,636 --> 0:49:21,676
done with the lesson and view

1674
00:49:21,676 --> 0:49:22,886
the chapter at the end.

1675
00:49:24,086 --> 0:49:25,226
In a detail view, that will show

1676
00:49:25,226 --> 0:49:26,526
more details as we tap on the

1677
00:49:26,526 --> 0:49:29,506
Moon, the Earth, and the Sun.

1678
00:49:29,506 --> 0:49:30,506
Additionally, we have some view

1679
00:49:30,506 --> 0:49:31,906
models that will just drive that

1680
00:49:31,906 --> 0:49:33,066
detail view, so it just shows

1681
00:49:33,066 --> 0:49:35,176
some text, and then some basic

1682
00:49:35,176 --> 0:49:36,736
application logic to kick off

1683
00:49:36,736 --> 0:49:37,166
our loading.

1684
00:49:37,496 --> 0:49:38,736
And let's look at loading first.

1685
00:49:40,136 --> 0:49:41,356
So down here, the first thing

1686
00:49:41,356 --> 0:49:42,896
you'll notice is we're using

1687
00:49:42,896 --> 0:49:44,166
code generation in this project.

1688
00:49:44,716 --> 0:49:46,846
So our Reality Composer project

1689
00:49:46,846 --> 0:49:48,086
is automatically converted into

1690
00:49:48,086 --> 0:49:49,016
an object that we can use.

1691
00:49:49,016 --> 0:49:50,356
It's a real type, so we can use

1692
00:49:50,356 --> 0:49:52,216
it right here for the size

1693
00:49:52,216 --> 0:49:53,516
chapter property.

1694
00:49:54,506 --> 0:49:55,796
So for example, Solar System

1695
00:49:55,796 --> 0:49:57,676
lesson.size chapter is a real

1696
00:49:57,676 --> 0:49:58,486
type that we can use.

1697
00:49:59,036 --> 0:50:02,016
We can go ahead and load our

1698
00:49:59,036 --> 0:50:02,016
We can go ahead and load our

1699
00:50:02,016 --> 0:50:04,066
scene and let's walk through

1700
00:50:04,216 --> 0:50:04,816
this code as well.

1701
00:50:04,816 --> 0:50:06,186
So what we're doing is loading

1702
00:50:06,186 --> 0:50:08,426
the size chapter asynchronously

1703
00:50:08,836 --> 0:50:11,596
and then we're handling, we're

1704
00:50:11,596 --> 0:50:13,266
giving the loaded anchor

1705
00:50:13,546 --> 0:50:14,706
collision shapes so that tap

1706
00:50:14,706 --> 0:50:15,196
triggers work.

1707
00:50:15,196 --> 0:50:16,976
And then we're adding it into

1708
00:50:16,976 --> 0:50:17,376
our scene.

1709
00:50:18,086 --> 0:50:19,086
Because we'll be using the size

1710
00:50:19,086 --> 0:50:20,546
chapter later, we're storing it

1711
00:50:20,606 --> 0:50:22,576
in the size chapter property and

1712
00:50:22,576 --> 0:50:23,816
we're setting up notify actions,

1713
00:50:23,816 --> 0:50:24,706
which we'll get to later.

1714
00:50:24,706 --> 0:50:25,806
Right now it's not hooked up.

1715
00:50:26,616 --> 0:50:27,706
So let's go ahead and run this.

1716
00:50:28,086 --> 0:50:29,046
We'll see with just a few lines

1717
00:50:29,046 --> 0:50:30,806
of code we're bringing our

1718
00:50:30,806 --> 0:50:32,596
entire AR experience and it

1719
00:50:32,596 --> 0:50:33,896
should work exactly the same way

1720
00:50:33,896 --> 0:50:35,336
it did in Reality Composer.

1721
00:50:35,906 --> 0:50:38,036
So here we go.

1722
00:50:38,036 --> 0:50:38,676
We have our scene.

1723
00:50:38,676 --> 0:50:39,556
We see the content.

1724
00:50:39,556 --> 0:50:40,806
For example, chapter completed

1725
00:50:40,806 --> 0:50:42,366
is hidden and when we tap on

1726
00:50:42,366 --> 0:50:43,856
each of our celestial bodies,

1727
00:50:44,266 --> 0:50:45,836
we'll see text automatically

1728
00:50:45,836 --> 0:50:47,896
appear and it will face the

1729
00:50:47,896 --> 0:50:49,046
camera no matter where we're

1730
00:50:49,046 --> 0:50:51,696
looking, and same with the Sun.

1731
00:50:52,076 --> 0:50:52,856
So, that looks pretty great.

1732
00:50:52,856 --> 0:50:53,866
With a few lines of code, we

1733
00:50:53,866 --> 0:50:54,966
brought our entire Reality

1734
00:50:54,966 --> 0:50:56,746
Composer project into Xcode.

1735
00:50:56,746 --> 0:50:57,496
It's super simple.

1736
00:50:57,946 --> 0:50:59,186
What I want to do next is

1737
00:50:59,186 --> 0:51:00,676
actually fill in this detail

1738
00:50:59,186 --> 0:51:00,676
actually fill in this detail

1739
00:51:00,676 --> 0:51:00,856
view.

1740
00:51:00,856 --> 0:51:01,916
You'll notice when I tapped the

1741
00:51:01,916 --> 0:51:03,516
Sun, for example, the detail

1742
00:51:03,516 --> 0:51:05,026
view didn't actually get filled

1743
00:51:05,026 --> 0:51:05,196
in.

1744
00:51:05,256 --> 0:51:07,706
So let's jump back to Xcode and

1745
00:51:07,706 --> 0:51:09,626
fill in the notify actions.

1746
00:51:14,836 --> 0:51:17,186
So because our notify actions

1747
00:51:17,186 --> 0:51:18,586
are automatically generated for

1748
00:51:18,586 --> 0:51:20,336
us, we also get an all actions

1749
00:51:20,396 --> 0:51:21,846
array that we can filter over.

1750
00:51:22,096 --> 0:51:23,646
And we're going to filter over

1751
00:51:23,646 --> 0:51:25,196
those actions to get only the

1752
00:51:25,196 --> 0:51:26,446
actions we care about which

1753
00:51:26,446 --> 0:51:27,186
begin with display.

1754
00:51:27,766 --> 0:51:31,576
So, let's walk through this

1755
00:51:31,576 --> 0:51:32,000
code.

1756
00:51:33,296 --> 0:51:35,066
Because we set up notify actions

1757
00:51:35,126 --> 0:51:36,956
in our size chapter, we can jump

1758
00:51:36,956 --> 0:51:38,666
back to Reality Composer to look

1759
00:51:39,266 --> 0:51:40,326
at those.

1760
00:51:40,536 --> 0:51:41,796
For each the Moon, the Earth,

1761
00:51:41,796 --> 0:51:44,266
and the Sun, right here, display

1762
00:51:44,266 --> 0:51:45,446
Moon details, display Earth

1763
00:51:45,446 --> 0:51:46,706
details, and display Sun

1764
00:51:46,706 --> 0:51:48,306
details, we can access these in

1765
00:51:48,306 --> 0:51:48,566
code.

1766
00:51:48,886 --> 0:51:49,996
And we want to actually filter

1767
00:51:49,996 --> 0:51:51,946
over our notify actions for only

1768
00:51:52,076 --> 0:51:53,516
actions that begin with display,

1769
00:51:53,746 --> 0:51:55,016
because we want to set the same

1770
00:51:55,266 --> 0:51:56,536
closure for each of them.

1771
00:51:57,846 --> 0:51:59,036
So, jumping back to Xcode,

1772
00:51:59,486 --> 0:52:00,446
that's what we're doing here.

1773
00:51:59,486 --> 0:52:00,446
that's what we're doing here.

1774
00:52:00,606 --> 0:52:02,506
We're doing size chapter.actions

1775
00:52:02,506 --> 0:52:03,816
.all actions, and we're

1776
00:52:03,816 --> 0:52:05,246
filtering over it, getting the

1777
00:52:05,246 --> 0:52:06,836
identifier from the notify

1778
00:52:06,836 --> 0:52:08,836
action object, and checking that

1779
00:52:08,836 --> 0:52:09,766
it starts with display.

1780
00:52:10,866 --> 0:52:12,366
Next we're iterating over all of

1781
00:52:12,366 --> 0:52:14,126
the display actions and setting

1782
00:52:14,126 --> 0:52:16,306
the same closure for each using

1783
00:52:16,306 --> 0:52:17,306
the on-action property.

1784
00:52:18,456 --> 0:52:19,776
And we're taking the target of

1785
00:52:19,776 --> 0:52:21,426
our notify action, in this case

1786
00:52:21,426 --> 0:52:22,656
for the Moon it's the Moon, for

1787
00:52:22,656 --> 0:52:24,016
the Sun it's the Sun, and for

1788
00:52:24,016 --> 0:52:26,506
the Earth it's the Earth, and

1789
00:52:26,506 --> 0:52:27,726
using that entity to display

1790
00:52:27,726 --> 0:52:28,566
different view models.

1791
00:52:29,746 --> 0:52:30,926
So let's run this application

1792
00:52:30,926 --> 0:52:31,096
now.

1793
00:52:31,636 --> 0:52:33,116
And what we like to see is

1794
00:52:33,116 --> 0:52:34,176
different view models appear

1795
00:52:34,176 --> 0:52:35,646
when we tap on each of our

1796
00:52:35,646 --> 0:52:37,046
celestial bodies.

1797
00:52:37,876 --> 0:52:38,516
There we go.

1798
00:52:39,516 --> 0:52:41,146
So we have our content, and now

1799
00:52:41,146 --> 0:52:42,826
when we tap on the Moon, because

1800
00:52:42,826 --> 0:52:44,826
we've set up a notify action and

1801
00:52:44,826 --> 0:52:46,376
we're observing those

1802
00:52:46,376 --> 0:52:48,276
notifications, we're now seeing

1803
00:52:48,276 --> 0:52:49,646
the Moon detail right at the

1804
00:52:49,646 --> 0:52:50,266
bottom here.

1805
00:52:50,536 --> 0:52:52,056
When we tap on the Earth, we see

1806
00:52:52,056 --> 0:52:53,906
Earth's details, and we tap on

1807
00:52:53,906 --> 0:52:55,586
the Sun, we're seeing the Sun's

1808
00:52:55,586 --> 0:52:55,926
details.

1809
00:52:56,236 --> 0:52:57,146
That looks pretty great.

1810
00:52:58,616 --> 0:52:59,906
We also were keeping some state.

1811
00:52:59,996 --> 0:53:01,786
So, when we tap on all three of

1812
00:52:59,996 --> 0:53:01,786
So, when we tap on all three of

1813
00:53:02,016 --> 0:53:03,256
our Earth, Sun, and Moon

1814
00:53:03,256 --> 0:53:05,296
actions, we're just making sure

1815
00:53:05,296 --> 0:53:06,146
that three different actions

1816
00:53:06,146 --> 0:53:07,626
were called, and we display a

1817
00:53:07,626 --> 0:53:09,086
complete lesson button up here

1818
00:53:09,086 --> 0:53:09,866
in the right-hand corner.

1819
00:53:10,926 --> 0:53:12,576
So what we want to do now is

1820
00:53:12,626 --> 0:53:13,886
using Notification Triggers,

1821
00:53:14,566 --> 0:53:16,096
fire off those size relative

1822
00:53:16,096 --> 0:53:18,016
size, and size to same size

1823
00:53:18,016 --> 0:53:19,556
action sequences that we set up

1824
00:53:19,556 --> 0:53:21,046
in Reality Composer using the

1825
00:53:21,046 --> 0:53:22,716
segmented control at the top and

1826
00:53:22,716 --> 0:53:23,726
the button in the upper

1827
00:53:23,726 --> 0:53:25,000
right-hand corner.

1828
00:53:30,376 --> 0:53:31,956
So, we can do this with a

1829
00:53:31,956 --> 0:53:33,436
segmented control value change

1830
00:53:33,436 --> 0:53:33,686
method.

1831
00:53:33,686 --> 0:53:34,796
This is an Interface Builder

1832
00:53:34,796 --> 0:53:36,336
method that we've set up and

1833
00:53:36,336 --> 0:53:37,836
hooked up in Interface Builder

1834
00:53:37,836 --> 0:53:38,226
itself.

1835
00:53:42,066 --> 0:53:44,076
And using our Notification

1836
00:53:44,076 --> 0:53:46,216
Action, Triggers, we can fire

1837
00:53:46,216 --> 0:53:47,656
the scale to same size action

1838
00:53:47,656 --> 0:53:49,046
sequence, which we set up in

1839
00:53:49,046 --> 0:53:52,036
Reality Composer down here,

1840
00:53:52,036 --> 0:53:53,726
which will scale each of our

1841
00:53:53,726 --> 0:53:55,146
celestial bodies back to their

1842
00:53:55,146 --> 0:53:56,656
original scale of 100%.

1843
00:53:57,836 --> 0:53:59,396
And when the size segmented

1844
00:53:59,396 --> 0:54:00,486
control is selected, we want to

1845
00:53:59,396 --> 0:54:00,486
control is selected, we want to

1846
00:54:00,486 --> 0:54:02,426
scale our Sun to a relative size

1847
00:54:02,866 --> 0:54:03,326
to the Earth.

1848
00:54:04,316 --> 0:54:06,486
To do that, we can fire our

1849
00:54:07,056 --> 0:54:09,686
scale to relative sizes action

1850
00:54:09,686 --> 0:54:10,156
sequence.

1851
00:54:10,956 --> 0:54:12,676
And finally when the lesson

1852
00:54:12,676 --> 0:54:14,476
completed button is tapped, this

1853
00:54:14,476 --> 0:54:15,576
is an Interface Builder action

1854
00:54:15,576 --> 0:54:17,386
that we've set up and hooked up,

1855
00:54:19,256 --> 0:54:20,956
we'll fire the chapter completed

1856
00:54:21,286 --> 0:54:22,206
Notification Trigger.

1857
00:54:22,936 --> 0:54:24,536
And what this one does is

1858
00:54:24,536 --> 0:54:25,756
because there are three

1859
00:54:25,756 --> 0:54:27,096
different Notification Triggers

1860
00:54:27,206 --> 0:54:28,506
hooked up in Reality Composer,

1861
00:54:28,876 --> 0:54:30,156
we'll fire all three of these

1862
00:54:30,156 --> 0:54:31,046
action sequences.

1863
00:54:31,456 --> 0:54:32,736
We'll fade out the existing

1864
00:54:32,736 --> 0:54:33,196
content.

1865
00:54:34,666 --> 0:54:36,276
We'll then begin an orbit of our

1866
00:54:36,276 --> 0:54:37,446
little Earth and little Moon.

1867
00:54:38,006 --> 0:54:40,686
And we'll show the chapter

1868
00:54:40,686 --> 0:54:41,756
completed section.

1869
00:54:42,266 --> 0:54:46,346
So, let's run this now and see

1870
00:54:46,346 --> 0:54:46,906
our application.

1871
00:54:50,876 --> 0:54:51,956
All right, so here we have our

1872
00:54:51,956 --> 0:54:52,366
content.

1873
00:54:52,926 --> 0:54:54,296
We can tap on the Moon.

1874
00:54:54,296 --> 0:54:55,676
Everything works exactly the

1875
00:54:55,676 --> 0:54:56,826
same as we set up in Reality

1876
00:54:56,826 --> 0:54:57,326
Composer.

1877
00:54:57,566 --> 0:54:59,146
And now when we tap the size

1878
00:54:59,146 --> 0:55:00,426
segmented control when looking

1879
00:54:59,146 --> 0:55:00,426
segmented control when looking

1880
00:55:00,426 --> 0:55:01,996
at the Earth and the Sun, we get

1881
00:55:01,996 --> 0:55:03,986
a really good scale of just how

1882
00:55:03,986 --> 0:55:05,756
big the Sun is compared to

1883
00:55:05,756 --> 0:55:05,966
Earth.

1884
00:55:06,236 --> 0:55:06,956
It's pretty tiny.

1885
00:55:07,556 --> 0:55:09,466
So, that looks great.

1886
00:55:09,616 --> 0:55:11,596
Let's size it back, and let's

1887
00:55:11,596 --> 0:55:12,346
complete our lesson.

1888
00:55:12,346 --> 0:55:13,526
I'm going to tap the lesson

1889
00:55:13,526 --> 0:55:14,666
completed, the complete lesson

1890
00:55:14,666 --> 0:55:15,716
button at the top right-hand

1891
00:55:15,716 --> 0:55:16,026
corner.

1892
00:55:16,686 --> 0:55:18,306
And we'll see our content fades

1893
00:55:18,306 --> 0:55:19,836
out, and we see our chapter

1894
00:55:19,836 --> 0:55:22,086
completed along with an orbit

1895
00:55:22,086 --> 0:55:23,186
starting for our tiny Sun.

1896
00:55:23,696 --> 0:55:24,936
That looks pretty great, and we

1897
00:55:24,936 --> 0:55:26,486
can see how with Notification

1898
00:55:26,486 --> 0:55:28,576
Triggers and Notify Actions, we

1899
00:55:28,576 --> 0:55:29,876
can work with our application

1900
00:55:29,926 --> 0:55:30,936
and our AR content.

1901
00:55:31,226 --> 0:55:32,276
There's one last thing I want to

1902
00:55:32,276 --> 0:55:32,446
do.

1903
00:55:32,446 --> 0:55:33,676
We discussed post with

1904
00:55:33,676 --> 0:55:35,076
overrides, and I want to show

1905
00:55:35,076 --> 0:55:36,146
you how we can use that to

1906
00:55:36,146 --> 0:55:37,656
display dynamic content using

1907
00:55:37,656 --> 0:55:38,436
application state.

1908
00:55:39,116 --> 0:55:40,196
So because this is a lesson

1909
00:55:40,196 --> 0:55:41,606
application, we want to display

1910
00:55:41,606 --> 0:55:43,146
gold stars based on how well a

1911
00:55:43,146 --> 0:55:44,426
student does.

1912
00:55:46,986 --> 0:55:48,476
For this session, I think we all

1913
00:55:48,476 --> 0:55:49,406
did pretty great so I'm just

1914
00:55:49,406 --> 0:55:50,346
going to give us three stars,

1915
00:55:50,346 --> 0:55:51,566
and we can see how we can set

1916
00:55:51,566 --> 0:55:51,956
this up.

1917
00:55:52,546 --> 0:55:53,576
This is a method that we're

1918
00:55:53,576 --> 0:55:55,826
calling inside of our display

1919
00:55:55,826 --> 0:55:58,316
details view up above where

1920
00:55:58,396 --> 0:55:59,176
we're keeping state.

1921
00:55:59,726 --> 0:56:02,896
So this looks like a lot of code

1922
00:55:59,726 --> 0:56:02,896
So this looks like a lot of code

1923
00:56:02,896 --> 0:56:03,986
that I just pasted in, but let's

1924
00:56:03,986 --> 0:56:04,506
walk through it.

1925
00:56:05,366 --> 0:56:06,396
So the first thing we're doing

1926
00:56:06,796 --> 0:56:08,496
is accessing our special star

1927
00:56:08,496 --> 0:56:09,756
entity that we set up in Reality

1928
00:56:09,756 --> 0:56:12,056
Composer right here.

1929
00:56:12,276 --> 0:56:15,966
We've given it the name special

1930
00:56:15,966 --> 0:56:17,196
star, so we're now accessing it

1931
00:56:17,566 --> 0:56:18,336
right in Xcode.

1932
00:56:19,456 --> 0:56:21,016
Next, we're triggering the show

1933
00:56:21,016 --> 0:56:23,826
gold star action sequence right

1934
00:56:23,826 --> 0:56:25,336
in code, so that will display

1935
00:56:25,336 --> 0:56:26,286
the first gold star.

1936
00:56:26,286 --> 0:56:27,556
But we want to display three.

1937
00:56:28,216 --> 0:56:29,806
So, we can do that by

1938
00:56:30,136 --> 0:56:31,576
dispatching after maybe two and

1939
00:56:31,576 --> 0:56:33,216
a half seconds for this demo,

1940
00:56:33,636 --> 0:56:34,996
and we're going to clone the

1941
00:56:34,996 --> 0:56:35,446
star.

1942
00:56:36,456 --> 0:56:37,496
Then we're going to position it

1943
00:56:37,936 --> 0:56:39,926
to the right and up a little

1944
00:56:39,926 --> 0:56:40,236
bit.

1945
00:56:40,996 --> 0:56:41,776
We're going to add it to our

1946
00:56:41,776 --> 0:56:42,296
scene.

1947
00:56:42,556 --> 0:56:45,096
And then using post overrides,

1948
00:56:45,096 --> 0:56:46,296
we're passing in the original

1949
00:56:46,296 --> 0:56:47,696
target of the action sequence,

1950
00:56:47,996 --> 0:56:50,006
and then passing in the new

1951
00:56:50,006 --> 0:56:51,556
action, the new target of the

1952
00:56:51,556 --> 0:56:52,696
action, in this case the right

1953
00:56:52,696 --> 0:56:53,056
star.

1954
00:56:53,296 --> 0:56:55,266
And we want to do the same thing

1955
00:56:55,266 --> 0:56:55,986
for the left star.

1956
00:56:56,046 --> 0:56:57,036
So, we're copying it again,

1957
00:56:57,556 --> 0:56:58,266
copying the star.

1958
00:56:59,016 --> 0:57:00,476
Positioning it to the left and

1959
00:56:59,016 --> 0:57:00,476
Positioning it to the left and

1960
00:57:00,476 --> 0:57:02,686
down a little bit, adding it to

1961
00:57:02,686 --> 0:57:04,336
our scene, and again, posting

1962
00:57:04,336 --> 0:57:05,756
with overrides, taking the

1963
00:57:05,756 --> 0:57:07,316
original name and passing in the

1964
00:57:07,316 --> 0:57:08,806
left star this time as the

1965
00:57:09,036 --> 0:57:10,576
target of our action sequence.

1966
00:57:11,856 --> 0:57:12,916
So, let's build and run this app

1967
00:57:12,916 --> 0:57:13,956
now, and what we'd like to see

1968
00:57:13,956 --> 0:57:15,686
is three gold stars appear, even

1969
00:57:15,686 --> 0:57:16,916
though we've only set up one in

1970
00:57:16,916 --> 0:57:17,646
our application.

1971
00:57:17,776 --> 0:57:18,876
This is driven entirely by

1972
00:57:18,876 --> 0:57:19,656
application logic.

1973
00:57:25,456 --> 0:57:26,786
So here's our scene again.

1974
00:57:27,196 --> 0:57:28,476
We can walk through the lesson.

1975
00:57:29,136 --> 0:57:31,376
I think I'm done now, so I'll

1976
00:57:31,976 --> 0:57:33,786
click complete lesson.

1977
00:57:34,236 --> 0:57:35,466
And we see one gold star

1978
00:57:35,466 --> 0:57:36,006
appears.

1979
00:57:36,736 --> 0:57:37,946
We'll see a second gold star

1980
00:57:37,946 --> 0:57:38,466
appears.

1981
00:57:38,946 --> 0:57:40,146
And there's our third star.

1982
00:57:40,146 --> 0:57:41,206
We did a great job, so we got

1983
00:57:41,206 --> 0:57:41,816
three stars here.

1985
00:57:51,436 --> 0:57:53,106
So, that's how easy it is to

1986
00:57:53,106 --> 0:57:54,696
load your AR content into your

1987
00:57:54,696 --> 0:57:56,936
application, begin working with

1988
00:57:56,936 --> 0:57:58,326
it with notify actions to

1989
00:57:58,326 --> 0:57:59,156
provide your custom own

1990
00:57:59,156 --> 0:58:00,616
implementations, and then

1991
00:57:59,156 --> 0:58:00,616
implementations, and then

1992
00:58:00,616 --> 0:58:02,296
Trigger Action sequences that

1993
00:58:02,296 --> 0:58:03,566
you set up in Reality Composer

1994
00:58:03,896 --> 0:58:05,276
using Notification Triggers.

1995
00:58:05,436 --> 0:58:08,336
So, let's take a tour of what we

1996
00:58:08,336 --> 0:58:08,866
learned today.

1997
00:58:09,026 --> 0:58:10,366
We learned with Reality Composer

1998
00:58:10,366 --> 0:58:11,906
we can create amazing AR

1999
00:58:11,906 --> 0:58:14,036
experiences using the built-in

2000
00:58:14,146 --> 0:58:15,766
modular assets, for example the

2001
00:58:15,766 --> 0:58:17,166
sphere or the cube.

2002
00:58:17,506 --> 0:58:18,896
And then we can bring those

2003
00:58:18,896 --> 0:58:20,776
assets to life with behaviors

2004
00:58:21,096 --> 0:58:23,506
and simple interactions.

2005
00:58:24,616 --> 0:58:25,606
Finally, we can bring those

2006
00:58:25,606 --> 0:58:27,536
amazing AR experiences into our

2007
00:58:27,536 --> 0:58:29,146
applications using code

2008
00:58:29,146 --> 0:58:30,546
generation and deep integration

2009
00:58:30,546 --> 0:58:31,056
with Xcode.

2010
00:58:31,256 --> 0:58:32,646
We have already seen some

2011
00:58:32,646 --> 0:58:34,206
amazing stuff being created by

2012
00:58:34,206 --> 0:58:36,206
you guys using Reality Composer.

2013
00:58:36,506 --> 0:58:37,916
We encourage you guys to keep

2014
00:58:37,916 --> 0:58:38,326
creating.

2015
00:58:38,326 --> 0:58:39,996
We're super excited to see the

2016
00:58:39,996 --> 0:58:41,686
amazing AR applications that you

2017
00:58:41,686 --> 0:58:42,246
can create.

2018
00:58:43,126 --> 0:58:44,876
We have some sessions and labs

2019
00:58:44,876 --> 0:58:46,796
available to you guys today and

2020
00:58:46,796 --> 0:58:49,076
tomorrow, and we encourage you

2021
00:58:49,076 --> 0:58:50,046
guys to bring questions, your

2022
00:58:50,046 --> 0:58:51,426
projects, anything else, we're

2023
00:58:51,426 --> 0:58:52,146
happy to help you.

2024
00:58:52,646 --> 0:58:54,956
Have a great rest of your WWDC.

2025
00:58:54,956 --> 0:58:55,976
