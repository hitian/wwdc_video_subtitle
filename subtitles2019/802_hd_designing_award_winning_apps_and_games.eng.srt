3
00:00:13,076 --> 0:00:13,676
&gt;&gt; Hey, everyone.

4
00:00:13,886 --> 0:00:14,886
My name is Lauren.

5
00:00:15,066 --> 0:00:15,606
&gt;&gt; And I'm Doug.

6
00:00:15,826 --> 0:00:16,996
&gt;&gt; And we're on the Design

7
00:00:17,036 --> 0:00:18,076
Evangelism Team.

8
00:00:18,746 --> 0:00:20,566
On Monday night, we hosted the

9
00:00:20,566 --> 0:00:22,506
Apple Design Awards and we

10
00:00:22,506 --> 0:00:23,856
honored some of the best apps

11
00:00:23,856 --> 0:00:25,656
and games that we saw this year.

12
00:00:26,256 --> 0:00:27,506
&gt;&gt; Each year we're really

13
00:00:27,506 --> 0:00:28,946
inspired by the work the

14
00:00:28,946 --> 0:00:30,396
developer community does on our

15
00:00:30,396 --> 0:00:31,176
platforms.

16
00:00:31,646 --> 0:00:33,466
And we're excited to show you

17
00:00:33,466 --> 0:00:34,676
the apps and games tonight.

18
00:00:37,696 --> 0:00:38,686
So we almost called this

19
00:00:38,686 --> 0:00:40,856
session, How to Win an Apple

20
00:00:40,856 --> 0:00:42,606
Design Award, because we get

21
00:00:42,606 --> 0:00:43,676
asked about it a lot.

22
00:00:44,196 --> 0:00:45,316
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and we totally

23
00:00:45,316 --> 0:00:46,796
understand why people would ask

24
00:00:46,796 --> 0:00:47,836
this question, right?

25
00:00:48,096 --> 0:00:51,316
&gt;&gt; Totally makes sense to wonder

26
00:00:51,316 --> 0:00:52,936
what goes into the selection of

27
00:00:52,936 --> 0:00:55,556
just a few apps and games.

28
00:00:55,966 --> 0:00:57,746
&gt;&gt; So are there any criteria

29
00:00:57,746 --> 0:00:59,316
behind the apps and games that

30
00:00:59,526 --> 0:01:00,236
we selected?

31
00:00:59,526 --> 0:01:00,236
we selected?

32
00:01:00,476 --> 0:01:02,656
&gt;&gt; Sure. Are we going to talk

33
00:01:02,656 --> 0:01:04,096
about those criteria today?

34
00:01:04,196 --> 0:01:06,916
&gt;&gt; Well, we're actually going to

35
00:01:06,916 --> 0:01:07,936
talk about something that is

36
00:01:07,936 --> 0:01:09,826
much more compelling and useful

37
00:01:09,826 --> 0:01:10,216
to you.

38
00:01:10,216 --> 0:01:12,156
&gt;&gt; So we're going to talk about

39
00:01:12,156 --> 0:01:15,436
the values that are behind these

40
00:01:15,436 --> 0:01:16,236
apps and games.

41
00:01:17,246 --> 0:01:18,976
&gt;&gt; Each app and game really

42
00:01:18,976 --> 0:01:20,936
delivers elements of all of

43
00:01:20,996 --> 0:01:21,366
these.

44
00:01:22,126 --> 0:01:23,316
But we're going to take you on a

45
00:01:23,316 --> 0:01:25,716
journey behind the scenes of the

46
00:01:25,716 --> 0:01:27,186
award-winning apps and games.

47
00:01:27,186 --> 0:01:28,896
&gt;&gt; And we're going to tell you

48
00:01:29,326 --> 0:01:31,886
short stories about the design

49
00:01:31,886 --> 0:01:34,036
processes and methods that went

50
00:01:34,036 --> 0:01:34,896
into each one.

51
00:01:36,336 --> 0:01:38,486
In each story we're going to

52
00:01:38,556 --> 0:01:40,406
tease out some lessons.

53
00:01:40,786 --> 0:01:42,616
&gt;&gt; So let's dive right in.

54
00:01:43,596 --> 0:01:44,206
&gt;&gt; Innovation.

55
00:01:44,206 --> 0:01:44,926
&gt;&gt; Innovation.

56
00:01:46,186 --> 0:01:47,826
&gt;&gt; It's sort of an obvious place

57
00:01:47,826 --> 0:01:49,566
to start maybe, but there were

58
00:01:49,566 --> 0:01:51,286
some really innovative apps and

59
00:01:51,286 --> 0:01:52,366
games this year.

60
00:01:52,786 --> 0:01:54,636
So each of these apps that we're

61
00:01:54,636 --> 0:01:55,926
going to talk about brings out a

62
00:01:55,926 --> 0:01:56,956
different dimension of

63
00:01:56,956 --> 0:01:57,596
innovation.

64
00:01:57,886 --> 0:01:59,646
&gt;&gt; All right, so let's start

65
00:02:00,056 --> 0:02:01,516
with Asphalt 9.

66
00:02:01,946 --> 0:02:04,536
Asphalt 9 is a racing game with

67
00:02:04,536 --> 0:02:06,496
an innovative new control scheme

68
00:02:06,866 --> 0:02:08,705
and to best explain it, I just

69
00:02:08,705 --> 0:02:09,765
think we should check it out.

70
00:02:14,366 --> 0:02:17,976
Three, two, one.

71
00:02:19,486 --> 0:02:21,696
In Asphalt 9, you focus on item

72
00:02:21,696 --> 0:02:23,366
and path selection with swipes,

73
00:02:23,936 --> 0:02:25,286
just like this.

74
00:02:26,136 --> 0:02:28,156
And you tap and hold that gives

75
00:02:28,156 --> 0:02:29,836
you nitro and boost action.

76
00:02:30,556 --> 0:02:32,096
Now drifts and nitro are the

77
00:02:32,096 --> 0:02:34,186
main actions of acceleration and

78
00:02:34,186 --> 0:02:35,006
braking in this game.

79
00:02:36,186 --> 0:02:37,146
Now this is not a

80
00:02:37,146 --> 0:02:38,166
driving-assisted.

81
00:02:38,166 --> 0:02:40,046
It's an entirely new way to

82
00:02:40,046 --> 0:02:40,366
play.

83
00:02:41,136 --> 0:02:43,296
And this new control scheme is

84
00:02:43,296 --> 0:02:44,666
called TouchDrive.

85
00:02:46,066 --> 0:02:48,426
But what makes TouchDrive so

86
00:02:48,426 --> 0:02:48,976
innovative?

87
00:02:49,986 --> 0:02:51,856
Because it subverts our

88
00:02:51,856 --> 0:02:53,566
expectations of racing game

89
00:02:53,566 --> 0:02:54,066
controls.

90
00:02:55,026 --> 0:02:56,436
To do this, the developer

91
00:02:56,436 --> 0:02:58,556
questioned basic assumptions

92
00:02:58,916 --> 0:03:00,436
that we all have taken for

93
00:02:58,916 --> 0:03:00,436
that we all have taken for

94
00:03:00,436 --> 0:03:00,926
granted.

95
00:03:01,796 --> 0:03:03,276
They questioned the assumption

96
00:03:03,336 --> 0:03:05,016
that driving controls required

97
00:03:05,016 --> 0:03:07,476
acceleration, braking and

98
00:03:07,476 --> 0:03:07,786
turning.

99
00:03:08,576 --> 0:03:10,126
So they started completely from

100
00:03:10,126 --> 0:03:10,626
scratch.

101
00:03:11,836 --> 0:03:13,896
This led to an exciting idea.

102
00:03:14,996 --> 0:03:16,526
After being challenged to figure

103
00:03:16,526 --> 0:03:18,026
out a simplified and more

104
00:03:18,026 --> 0:03:19,546
accessible control scheme for

105
00:03:19,546 --> 0:03:21,706
iOS, the developer tried this

106
00:03:21,706 --> 0:03:23,856
crazy idea that moves the main

107
00:03:23,856 --> 0:03:25,886
controls away from acceleration

108
00:03:25,886 --> 0:03:28,376
and braking to nitro and drift

109
00:03:28,376 --> 0:03:28,856
actions.

110
00:03:29,916 --> 0:03:31,326
They quickly realized there was

111
00:03:31,326 --> 0:03:32,716
something special there because

112
00:03:32,716 --> 0:03:34,376
it helped players get into the

113
00:03:34,376 --> 0:03:36,446
fun so much faster.

114
00:03:37,336 --> 0:03:38,566
But they were not done shaking

115
00:03:38,566 --> 0:03:39,116
things up yet.

116
00:03:40,156 --> 0:03:42,206
Asphalt 9 knew that traditional

117
00:03:42,206 --> 0:03:44,486
turning as a player control was

118
00:03:44,486 --> 0:03:47,236
very prone to player error.

119
00:03:47,656 --> 0:03:50,086
So after rounds of testing and

120
00:03:50,086 --> 0:03:52,076
feedback, they replaced

121
00:03:52,076 --> 0:03:53,966
traditional path -- excuse me,

122
00:03:53,966 --> 0:03:56,146
they replaced turning with path

123
00:03:56,456 --> 0:03:58,226
and item selection through swipe

124
00:03:58,226 --> 0:03:58,716
gestures.

125
00:03:59,576 --> 0:04:01,246
And this made people less

126
00:03:59,576 --> 0:04:01,246
And this made people less

127
00:04:01,376 --> 0:04:03,306
frustrated, because it helped

128
00:04:03,306 --> 0:04:04,556
people focus on learning the

129
00:04:04,556 --> 0:04:06,536
very elaborate tracks and play

130
00:04:06,596 --> 0:04:07,476
more strategically.

131
00:04:09,126 --> 0:04:10,756
So TouchDrive has now become the

132
00:04:10,756 --> 0:04:12,386
default control scheme for

133
00:04:12,386 --> 0:04:14,646
strategic racing, fine-tuning

134
00:04:14,816 --> 0:04:15,826
and level recon.

135
00:04:16,495 --> 0:04:18,106
Now full manual controls are a

136
00:04:18,106 --> 0:04:19,596
matter of surgical precision and

137
00:04:19,596 --> 0:04:20,776
are still available.

138
00:04:21,326 --> 0:04:23,506
But what I love is that this

139
00:04:23,556 --> 0:04:25,526
developer took an informed risk.

140
00:04:26,186 --> 0:04:28,466
After iterating, testing and

141
00:04:28,466 --> 0:04:30,496
getting feedback, the design

142
00:04:30,496 --> 0:04:32,336
decision to diverge from

143
00:04:32,336 --> 0:04:34,716
traditional driving controls has

144
00:04:34,716 --> 0:04:36,506
allowed for an entirely new

145
00:04:36,506 --> 0:04:37,966
experience to emerge.

146
00:04:38,756 --> 0:04:40,596
And the innovation of TouchDrive

147
00:04:40,846 --> 0:04:42,856
has revealed an entirely new way

148
00:04:42,856 --> 0:04:43,846
to play the game.

149
00:04:45,536 --> 0:04:48,786
So during your app design or

150
00:04:48,786 --> 0:04:51,886
game design process, question

151
00:04:51,886 --> 0:04:53,226
assumptions from the start.

152
00:04:54,226 --> 0:04:55,166
Ask questions.

153
00:04:55,566 --> 0:04:57,346
Ask, "Why are we doing it this

154
00:04:57,346 --> 0:04:57,676
way?"

155
00:04:58,116 --> 0:04:59,636
Is it because we've just always

156
00:04:59,686 --> 0:05:00,456
done it this way?

157
00:04:59,686 --> 0:05:00,456
done it this way?

158
00:05:00,456 --> 0:05:03,456
And convert problems into ideas,

159
00:05:03,996 --> 0:05:05,466
just like the problem of

160
00:05:05,466 --> 0:05:07,886
error-prone turning led to new

161
00:05:07,886 --> 0:05:09,606
path selection in Asphalt 9.

162
00:05:10,476 --> 0:05:12,206
Because when you do, you can

163
00:05:12,206 --> 0:05:14,566
create something that has never

164
00:05:14,686 --> 0:05:15,756
been done before.

165
00:05:17,206 --> 0:05:18,576
This game is so much fun.

166
00:05:19,676 --> 0:05:21,626
And that is truly innovative.

167
00:05:24,236 --> 0:05:27,146
&gt;&gt; Okay. Let's stay on the theme

168
00:05:27,146 --> 0:05:28,816
of crazy car stunts.

169
00:05:29,016 --> 0:05:30,546
No, actually, let's stay on the

170
00:05:30,546 --> 0:05:32,866
theme of simplification, making

171
00:05:32,866 --> 0:05:33,636
things easier.

172
00:05:34,116 --> 0:05:35,116
&gt;&gt; What could be simpler than

173
00:05:35,116 --> 0:05:36,176
jumping over the Golden Gate

174
00:05:36,176 --> 0:05:37,166
Bridge with a single swipe?

175
00:05:37,406 --> 0:05:39,676
&gt;&gt; Oh my God, wait till I show

176
00:05:39,676 --> 0:05:40,026
you this.

177
00:05:40,206 --> 0:05:41,696
&gt;&gt; All right.

178
00:05:41,746 --> 0:05:42,626
&gt;&gt; So I want to talk about

179
00:05:42,706 --> 0:05:43,246
HomeCourt.

180
00:05:43,286 --> 0:05:45,156
HomeCourt is an app that uses

181
00:05:45,156 --> 0:05:47,946
your iPhone camera and ML models

182
00:05:47,946 --> 0:05:49,276
to help you become a better

183
00:05:49,276 --> 0:05:50,256
basketball player.

184
00:05:50,966 --> 0:05:53,306
The app works so naturally and

185
00:05:53,306 --> 0:05:55,186
so effortlessly because the

186
00:05:55,186 --> 0:05:56,986
HomeCourt team focused on

187
00:05:56,986 --> 0:05:58,646
removing obstacles to getting

188
00:05:58,646 --> 0:06:00,556
started with each of your drills

189
00:05:58,646 --> 0:06:00,556
started with each of your drills

190
00:06:00,556 --> 0:06:01,296
and workouts.

191
00:06:01,296 --> 0:06:02,366
And I want to show you how they

192
00:06:02,366 --> 0:06:02,696
did it.

193
00:06:03,796 --> 0:06:06,126
So here's the HomeCourt app.

194
00:06:06,126 --> 0:06:07,656
Like I said, it uses the camera

195
00:06:08,036 --> 0:06:10,426
and machine learning to chart my

196
00:06:10,426 --> 0:06:11,896
shots on a basketball court.

197
00:06:12,406 --> 0:06:14,086
Before this app came along,

198
00:06:14,176 --> 0:06:15,766
people just didn't have access

199
00:06:15,806 --> 0:06:16,906
to this information.

200
00:06:17,386 --> 0:06:18,856
You really needed someone to

201
00:06:19,256 --> 0:06:22,006
manually chart it, each make and

202
00:06:22,006 --> 0:06:22,486
miss.

203
00:06:23,246 --> 0:06:25,646
You could also install an entire

204
00:06:25,646 --> 0:06:28,116
system in your gym to do it, but

205
00:06:28,116 --> 0:06:29,536
you couldn't really do it as

206
00:06:29,536 --> 0:06:31,786
easily as HomeCourt makes it.

207
00:06:32,476 --> 0:06:34,256
So how do you get this

208
00:06:34,256 --> 0:06:36,446
information just by using your

209
00:06:36,446 --> 0:06:36,906
iPhone?

210
00:06:37,456 --> 0:06:40,216
When I tried it, it feels like

211
00:06:40,216 --> 0:06:40,676
magic.

212
00:06:40,826 --> 0:06:42,426
And I wanted to know how they

213
00:06:42,426 --> 0:06:43,016
got there.

214
00:06:43,796 --> 0:06:45,256
So I asked them to tell me where

215
00:06:45,256 --> 0:06:47,386
they started and where this all

216
00:06:47,386 --> 0:06:48,086
came from.

217
00:06:48,236 --> 0:06:50,336
And the founder actually started

218
00:06:50,336 --> 0:06:51,986
out by saying, "When we first

219
00:06:51,986 --> 0:06:53,606
launched, the experience was

220
00:06:54,396 --> 0:06:55,546
actually not magical."

221
00:06:55,836 --> 0:06:59,486
So to get information from

222
00:06:59,576 --> 0:07:01,196
HomeCourt you had to go through

223
00:06:59,576 --> 0:07:01,196
HomeCourt you had to go through

224
00:07:01,196 --> 0:07:02,406
a series of steps.

225
00:07:02,906 --> 0:07:04,776
The first one was to put your

226
00:07:04,776 --> 0:07:06,066
phone in a tripod.

227
00:07:06,496 --> 0:07:08,176
I don't know how many basketball

228
00:07:08,426 --> 0:07:10,056
players are here, but if you

229
00:07:10,056 --> 0:07:11,286
play basketball, I'm guessing

230
00:07:11,286 --> 0:07:13,236
you don't go to play basketball

231
00:07:13,396 --> 0:07:17,476
with a tripod in your gym bag.

232
00:07:17,556 --> 0:07:19,626
So you know, it's clear that

233
00:07:19,626 --> 0:07:21,036
bringing the tripod is an

234
00:07:21,036 --> 0:07:22,076
obstacle, right?

235
00:07:22,076 --> 0:07:22,746
It's something you had to

236
00:07:22,746 --> 0:07:24,876
remember to bring and set up.

237
00:07:25,246 --> 0:07:26,436
And that wasn't the only

238
00:07:26,436 --> 0:07:27,096
obstacle.

239
00:07:27,276 --> 0:07:28,816
You needed equipment and you

240
00:07:28,816 --> 0:07:31,156
needed to do manual work to set

241
00:07:31,896 --> 0:07:32,986
up the app.

242
00:07:32,986 --> 0:07:35,156
Two of the requirements early on

243
00:07:35,406 --> 0:07:36,566
related to lighting.

244
00:07:36,946 --> 0:07:39,856
The app worked best when the sun

245
00:07:39,856 --> 0:07:43,626
was directly overhead on a super

246
00:07:43,626 --> 0:07:44,266
sunny day.

247
00:07:44,266 --> 0:07:47,266
You know, but other than that.

248
00:07:47,686 --> 0:07:49,426
So the HomeCourt team went to

249
00:07:49,426 --> 0:07:51,046
work and they tried to automate

250
00:07:51,046 --> 0:07:52,946
as much as possible using the

251
00:07:52,946 --> 0:07:54,876
camera and machine learning

252
00:07:54,876 --> 0:07:55,356
models.

253
00:07:56,426 --> 0:07:57,686
The first thing they did was

254
00:07:57,686 --> 0:07:59,876
find a way to detect the hoop.

255
00:08:02,046 --> 0:08:02,726
And then they were able to

256
00:08:02,726 --> 0:08:04,176
detect the three-point line.

257
00:08:04,466 --> 0:08:05,886
So this line is in different

258
00:08:05,886 --> 0:08:07,086
places in different kinds of

259
00:08:07,126 --> 0:08:09,446
courts, so this allowed them to

260
00:08:10,186 --> 0:08:11,546
better detect courts in

261
00:08:11,546 --> 0:08:12,506
different countries.

262
00:08:12,946 --> 0:08:14,806
So more and more people were

263
00:08:14,806 --> 0:08:16,266
able to use it at this point.

264
00:08:16,916 --> 0:08:18,196
And this also allowed them to

265
00:08:18,446 --> 0:08:19,816
begin to locate the shot a

266
00:08:19,816 --> 0:08:21,106
little more precisely.

267
00:08:22,596 --> 0:08:23,706
So they've removed some of the

268
00:08:23,706 --> 0:08:24,586
manual work.

269
00:08:24,586 --> 0:08:26,356
You didn't have to tap on the

270
00:08:26,356 --> 0:08:27,866
screen to identify the hoop

271
00:08:27,866 --> 0:08:29,056
anymore and you didn't have to

272
00:08:29,056 --> 0:08:31,846
draw a rectangle around the

273
00:08:31,846 --> 0:08:32,285
lane.

274
00:08:32,785 --> 0:08:35,895
Next, they found a way to detect

275
00:08:35,895 --> 0:08:36,576
legs.

276
00:08:37,086 --> 0:08:38,556
This allowed people to use the

277
00:08:38,556 --> 0:08:40,376
app in almost any lighting

278
00:08:40,376 --> 0:08:41,066
conditions.

279
00:08:41,126 --> 0:08:43,686
So you could use HomeCourt on a

280
00:08:44,256 --> 0:08:45,646
cloudy day.

281
00:08:45,896 --> 0:08:47,676
Soon after that, they kind of

282
00:08:47,676 --> 0:08:49,546
upgraded to full pose

283
00:08:49,546 --> 0:08:50,426
estimation.

284
00:08:50,426 --> 0:08:51,946
So this is detecting all the key

285
00:08:51,946 --> 0:08:53,766
body joints, and this helped

286
00:08:53,766 --> 0:08:56,096
them even more accurately map

287
00:08:56,256 --> 0:08:57,676
where the shot originated.

288
00:08:58,756 --> 0:08:59,976
So they're making progress,

289
00:08:59,976 --> 0:09:00,266
right?

290
00:08:59,976 --> 0:09:00,266
right?

291
00:09:00,266 --> 0:09:01,446
They're simplifying it, but you

292
00:09:01,446 --> 0:09:02,906
still had to bring the tripod.

293
00:09:03,856 --> 0:09:06,486
Until they created a mode that

294
00:09:06,486 --> 0:09:08,606
allowed you to set the phone on

295
00:09:08,606 --> 0:09:08,956
the ground.

296
00:09:11,136 --> 0:09:12,926
So this removed the final

297
00:09:12,926 --> 0:09:13,996
obstacles, and I want to show

298
00:09:13,996 --> 0:09:16,326
you how that last part happens.

299
00:09:17,176 --> 0:09:18,606
So now you can start tracking

300
00:09:18,606 --> 0:09:21,036
your shots just by propping your

301
00:09:21,036 --> 0:09:23,306
phone up against a water bottle,

302
00:09:24,236 --> 0:09:25,706
walking to the free throw line.

303
00:09:29,206 --> 0:09:30,296
And shooting a free throw.

304
00:09:30,836 --> 0:09:30,903
Aw.

305
00:09:32,676 --> 0:09:32,743
&gt;&gt; Aw.

306
00:09:33,756 --> 0:09:34,656
&gt;&gt; Never could get one.

307
00:09:35,016 --> 0:09:36,376
[ Laughter ]

308
00:09:36,376 --> 0:09:37,206
So it might not have been

309
00:09:37,206 --> 0:09:38,846
magical at first, but when you

310
00:09:38,846 --> 0:09:40,986
do it now, it feels like magic.

311
00:09:42,116 --> 0:09:43,236
And there's tons of machine

312
00:09:43,236 --> 0:09:45,906
learning at work, but you don't

313
00:09:45,906 --> 0:09:46,546
see it.

314
00:09:46,836 --> 0:09:48,266
You're not -- it's not right in

315
00:09:48,266 --> 0:09:48,996
your face.

316
00:09:48,996 --> 0:09:50,726
It doesn't feel that way.

317
00:09:51,106 --> 0:09:52,596
And with HomeCourt you get

318
00:09:52,596 --> 0:09:54,046
access to information you've

319
00:09:54,046 --> 0:09:55,006
never had before.

320
00:09:56,086 --> 0:09:57,326
And the app feels like an

321
00:09:57,326 --> 0:09:59,116
extension of what you already

322
00:09:59,116 --> 0:09:59,486
do.

323
00:10:00,136 --> 0:10:01,246
But it's been taken to another

324
00:10:01,246 --> 0:10:01,726
level.

325
00:10:02,146 --> 0:10:04,466
So it fits in the flow of your

326
00:10:04,466 --> 0:10:05,866
shooting practice, but gives you

327
00:10:05,866 --> 0:10:06,266
more.

328
00:10:06,906 --> 0:10:09,586
So the innovation here is

329
00:10:09,736 --> 0:10:10,806
probably obvious.

330
00:10:10,866 --> 0:10:12,336
It's a matter of simplifying

331
00:10:12,336 --> 0:10:15,066
down to what people want to do,

332
00:10:15,066 --> 0:10:16,596
fitting into the natural flow of

333
00:10:16,596 --> 0:10:18,496
their real life.

334
00:10:18,496 --> 0:10:19,816
And providing value without

335
00:10:19,816 --> 0:10:20,726
getting in the way.

336
00:10:21,246 --> 0:10:22,876
&gt;&gt; That's so awesome, Doug.

337
00:10:23,316 --> 0:10:25,076
I actually want to go play some

338
00:10:25,076 --> 0:10:25,886
basketball later.

339
00:10:26,496 --> 0:10:29,006
&gt;&gt; Let's go do some shooting.

340
00:10:32,046 --> 0:10:33,256
So these apps and games really

341
00:10:33,256 --> 0:10:34,336
pushed the boundaries.

342
00:10:34,966 --> 0:10:35,696
&gt;&gt; And the best kind of

343
00:10:35,696 --> 0:10:36,956
innovation is the kind that you

344
00:10:36,956 --> 0:10:37,976
don't even notice, right?

345
00:10:38,676 --> 0:10:40,096
&gt;&gt; Exactly, when they just make

346
00:10:40,126 --> 0:10:41,896
the experience simple and

347
00:10:41,896 --> 0:10:42,226
better.

348
00:10:42,636 --> 0:10:44,386
&gt;&gt; And truly, anything that

349
00:10:44,386 --> 0:10:45,826
helps a person feel more

350
00:10:45,826 --> 0:10:49,446
confident in using it is great.

351
00:10:49,646 --> 0:10:51,766
&gt;&gt; Speaking of confidence, let's

352
00:10:51,766 --> 0:10:53,096
go on to the next one, Trust.

353
00:10:53,096 --> 0:10:55,176
And I want to talk about how an

354
00:10:55,176 --> 0:10:56,896
app or a game can establish

355
00:10:56,926 --> 0:10:58,296
trust with the people who use

356
00:10:58,296 --> 0:10:58,476
it.

357
00:10:58,476 --> 0:11:00,216
And I'm going to use Pixelmator

358
00:10:58,476 --> 0:11:00,216
And I'm going to use Pixelmator

359
00:11:00,216 --> 0:11:01,936
Photo as an example of this.

360
00:11:02,256 --> 0:11:03,536
So this is a photo editor

361
00:11:03,536 --> 0:11:05,386
designed specifically for iPad

362
00:11:05,796 --> 0:11:07,196
and it also uses machine

363
00:11:07,196 --> 0:11:09,976
learning, but it's doing it

364
00:11:09,976 --> 0:11:12,086
trained on millions, literally

365
00:11:12,086 --> 0:11:14,166
millions of professional photos

366
00:11:14,166 --> 0:11:16,336
to make photo editing awesome

367
00:11:16,416 --> 0:11:17,036
and easy.

368
00:11:17,206 --> 0:11:18,076
And I want to show you how they

369
00:11:18,076 --> 0:11:18,446
do it.

370
00:11:19,566 --> 0:11:21,966
So I want to start by saying

371
00:11:21,966 --> 0:11:23,386
machine learning is popping up

372
00:11:23,386 --> 0:11:27,066
everywhere, but user experiences

373
00:11:27,066 --> 0:11:28,556
that are informed by machine

374
00:11:28,556 --> 0:11:30,626
learning can sometimes feel a

375
00:11:30,626 --> 0:11:32,306
bit like black boxes.

376
00:11:32,996 --> 0:11:34,976
You might often wonder, you

377
00:11:35,436 --> 0:11:36,716
might sometimes wonder, maybe

378
00:11:36,716 --> 0:11:38,286
often, "Why am I seeing this

379
00:11:38,326 --> 0:11:38,916
content?

380
00:11:39,316 --> 0:11:40,986
What forces are at work?

381
00:11:41,186 --> 0:11:43,316
Why is the app showing me this?"

382
00:11:43,846 --> 0:11:46,706
And there are also controls that

383
00:11:46,866 --> 0:11:49,706
claim to do magic things, but

384
00:11:49,706 --> 0:11:51,776
these can feel unpredictable and

385
00:11:51,776 --> 0:11:52,346
random.

386
00:11:52,606 --> 0:11:54,516
And so when things are hard to

387
00:11:54,816 --> 0:11:56,626
understand or hard to predict,

388
00:11:57,136 --> 0:11:58,956
it can be hard to trust them.

389
00:12:00,236 --> 0:12:01,846
So I want to show you Pixelmator

390
00:12:01,846 --> 0:12:03,976
Photo and how they handle it.

391
00:12:07,046 --> 0:12:07,716
I'm going to take a walk on the

392
00:12:07,716 --> 0:12:08,346
beach here.

393
00:12:11,046 --> 0:12:12,916
So on the surface, the UI is

394
00:12:12,956 --> 0:12:13,886
pretty conventional.

395
00:12:14,176 --> 0:12:15,306
There are tools in the

396
00:12:15,306 --> 0:12:17,646
navigation bar and there are

397
00:12:17,646 --> 0:12:19,326
base photo adjustments in the

398
00:12:19,326 --> 0:12:21,366
inspector and presets along the

399
00:12:21,366 --> 0:12:21,826
bottom.

400
00:12:22,676 --> 0:12:24,836
The core of any kind of power

401
00:12:24,836 --> 0:12:27,126
tool is the inspector, and in

402
00:12:27,126 --> 0:12:28,766
Pixelmator Photo this is where

403
00:12:28,816 --> 0:12:30,066
the base adjustments live.

404
00:12:30,796 --> 0:12:32,796
So these will be familiar to

405
00:12:32,796 --> 0:12:35,156
photo geeks and experts, but

406
00:12:35,156 --> 0:12:37,186
most people don't really know

407
00:12:37,186 --> 0:12:38,746
what any of those do, and they

408
00:12:38,746 --> 0:12:39,816
can frankly be a little

409
00:12:39,816 --> 0:12:40,616
intimidating.

410
00:12:42,076 --> 0:12:43,906
But the magic of Pixelmator

411
00:12:43,906 --> 0:12:46,306
Photo is a single button, and it

412
00:12:46,306 --> 0:12:47,656
allows you to apply the

413
00:12:47,656 --> 0:12:49,246
expertise of thousands of

414
00:12:49,246 --> 0:12:50,706
professional photographers to

415
00:12:50,706 --> 0:12:52,226
your photo with one button.

416
00:12:53,376 --> 0:12:53,976
There, I did it.

417
00:12:55,496 --> 0:12:56,526
You'll see it again.

418
00:12:57,236 --> 0:12:58,496
So when you tap that button,

419
00:12:58,496 --> 0:13:00,116
Pixelmator Photo is actually

420
00:12:58,496 --> 0:13:00,116
Pixelmator Photo is actually

421
00:13:00,116 --> 0:13:01,316
adjusting your photo with a

422
00:13:01,316 --> 0:13:03,846
model that's been trained on 20

423
00:13:03,846 --> 0:13:05,816
million professional photos.

424
00:13:08,256 --> 0:13:10,106
So the work behind the button is

425
00:13:10,106 --> 0:13:11,906
astounding and the results are

426
00:13:11,906 --> 0:13:12,816
pretty incredible.

427
00:13:13,626 --> 0:13:15,386
In the UI, they're using a

428
00:13:15,456 --> 0:13:17,226
familiar control you might have

429
00:13:17,226 --> 0:13:19,416
seen before, the Magic Wand.

430
00:13:19,896 --> 0:13:22,306
And Magic Wands in UIs typically

431
00:13:22,306 --> 0:13:25,316
mean don't worry about it, we

432
00:13:25,316 --> 0:13:26,226
know what we're doing.

433
00:13:26,226 --> 0:13:27,866
It's going to be awesome.

434
00:13:28,706 --> 0:13:30,126
But from a user point of view,

435
00:13:30,126 --> 0:13:31,486
you're not exactly sure what's

436
00:13:31,486 --> 0:13:32,866
happening when you tap that

437
00:13:32,906 --> 0:13:33,306
button.

438
00:13:34,376 --> 0:13:36,276
So when I ask the developers

439
00:13:36,276 --> 0:13:37,756
about this, about their choice

440
00:13:37,756 --> 0:13:40,236
of icon here, they kind of

441
00:13:40,236 --> 0:13:41,906
agreed that Magic Wands were

442
00:13:41,906 --> 0:13:44,116
often underwhelming, right?

443
00:13:44,206 --> 0:13:46,586
The results felt simplistic or

444
00:13:46,586 --> 0:13:47,396
cookie-cutter.

445
00:13:48,776 --> 0:13:50,686
So in order for this control to

446
00:13:50,686 --> 0:13:52,756
work and to be trusted by

447
00:13:52,756 --> 0:13:55,216
people, they wanted to make sure

448
00:13:55,216 --> 0:13:56,266
that the adjustments in the

449
00:13:56,266 --> 0:13:58,396
photo were clearly reflected in

450
00:13:58,396 --> 0:13:58,906
the UI.

451
00:14:00,496 --> 0:14:03,046
So what's happening kind of

452
00:14:03,046 --> 0:14:04,466
behind the scenes is that their

453
00:14:04,466 --> 0:14:06,486
models are identifying segments

454
00:14:06,486 --> 0:14:08,136
of content inside the frame.

455
00:14:08,356 --> 0:14:10,886
Water, sand and sky are detected

456
00:14:10,886 --> 0:14:12,836
and treated independently, and

457
00:14:12,836 --> 0:14:14,446
skin tone is as well.

458
00:14:15,046 --> 0:14:17,466
But what makes this experience

459
00:14:17,586 --> 0:14:19,946
so much different in my opinion

460
00:14:20,266 --> 0:14:22,236
is how clearly the parameters

461
00:14:22,236 --> 0:14:24,246
animate when the control is

462
00:14:24,246 --> 0:14:25,856
activated, and the ease with

463
00:14:25,856 --> 0:14:27,756
which I can go in and

464
00:14:27,756 --> 0:14:29,136
independently adjust any of

465
00:14:29,136 --> 0:14:29,446
them.

466
00:14:29,966 --> 0:14:32,096
So check out how it's increased

467
00:14:32,096 --> 0:14:33,896
the exposure of the landscape

468
00:14:34,216 --> 0:14:35,916
while leaving the skin tone

469
00:14:35,916 --> 0:14:36,446
alone.

470
00:14:36,946 --> 0:14:39,646
And I can flip the switch to

471
00:14:39,646 --> 0:14:42,696
deactivate them and then when I

472
00:14:42,696 --> 0:14:44,326
reactivate it, my adjustments

473
00:14:44,326 --> 0:14:45,076
are still there.

474
00:14:45,646 --> 0:14:48,476
So it seems simple but it's

475
00:14:48,476 --> 0:14:50,396
pretty remarkable when you use

476
00:14:50,396 --> 0:14:52,376
it and you feel the sense of

477
00:14:52,426 --> 0:14:55,696
confidence as you begin to

478
00:14:55,696 --> 0:14:58,996
adjust and edit the photo.

479
00:14:59,236 --> 0:15:01,486
So being able to see this as I

480
00:14:59,236 --> 0:15:01,486
So being able to see this as I

481
00:15:01,486 --> 0:15:03,246
do it provides a sense of

482
00:15:03,246 --> 0:15:03,736
comfort.

483
00:15:03,956 --> 0:15:05,836
I can see what's happening when

484
00:15:05,836 --> 0:15:08,136
I tap the Magic Wand and I can

485
00:15:08,136 --> 0:15:09,216
go in and make my own

486
00:15:09,216 --> 0:15:10,036
adjustments.

487
00:15:10,896 --> 0:15:12,606
So there's a fancy word kind of

488
00:15:12,796 --> 0:15:15,206
for this in user experience

489
00:15:15,206 --> 0:15:16,876
terms and it's attribution.

490
00:15:17,026 --> 0:15:18,856
I can see cause and effect.

491
00:15:19,526 --> 0:15:20,896
I can visually connect the

492
00:15:20,966 --> 0:15:23,166
effect of tapping the Magic Wand

493
00:15:23,166 --> 0:15:25,066
to the series of independent

494
00:15:25,066 --> 0:15:27,656
adjustments that's happening as

495
00:15:27,656 --> 0:15:28,426
a result of it.

496
00:15:28,426 --> 0:15:31,566
And this is empowering, right?

497
00:15:32,006 --> 0:15:33,666
Pixelmator Photo is revealing

498
00:15:33,666 --> 0:15:35,936
its intelligence to me and also

499
00:15:35,936 --> 0:15:37,616
offering levers to adjust it

500
00:15:37,686 --> 0:15:37,966
myself.

501
00:15:40,306 --> 0:15:42,086
So you can trust an app when the

502
00:15:42,086 --> 0:15:43,706
way that it works feels

503
00:15:43,706 --> 0:15:45,126
transparent and when you can

504
00:15:45,126 --> 0:15:47,606
establish a simple understanding

505
00:15:47,776 --> 0:15:48,666
of what's happening.

506
00:15:51,046 --> 0:15:52,906
So if I can understand or even

507
00:15:52,906 --> 0:15:54,626
better visualize what's

508
00:15:54,626 --> 0:15:56,576
happening, I'm much more likely

509
00:15:56,956 --> 0:15:58,746
to trust it and to take

510
00:15:58,746 --> 0:16:00,506
ownership over those results.

511
00:15:58,746 --> 0:16:00,506
ownership over those results.

512
00:16:01,066 --> 0:16:02,146
So you want to reveal what's

513
00:16:02,186 --> 0:16:04,096
behind a recommendation and

514
00:16:04,096 --> 0:16:06,976
offer ways to adjust it.

515
00:16:11,046 --> 0:16:12,146
So that pretty much wraps up

516
00:16:12,176 --> 0:16:12,556
trust.

517
00:16:13,056 --> 0:16:14,906
&gt;&gt; Okay. Sounds good.

518
00:16:15,276 --> 0:16:16,576
On to refinement.

519
00:16:17,836 --> 0:16:19,716
Now refinement is more than just

520
00:16:19,756 --> 0:16:20,726
working out problems.

521
00:16:21,476 --> 0:16:23,406
Refining something means that

522
00:16:23,406 --> 0:16:24,596
you're going to fine-tune it,

523
00:16:25,136 --> 0:16:26,986
hone it and make it more

524
00:16:26,986 --> 0:16:27,486
precise.

525
00:16:28,626 --> 0:16:30,336
Refining something means you're

526
00:16:30,336 --> 0:16:31,236
going to make it better.

527
00:16:32,666 --> 0:16:34,596
The Gardens Between is a game

528
00:16:34,726 --> 0:16:36,886
with dream-like levels, soothing

529
00:16:36,886 --> 0:16:38,686
art style and a heartwarming

530
00:16:38,776 --> 0:16:39,146
story.

531
00:16:40,356 --> 0:16:41,636
You have the power to go

532
00:16:41,716 --> 0:16:44,036
forwards and backwards in time,

533
00:16:44,396 --> 0:16:46,056
and you relive these experiences

534
00:16:46,056 --> 0:16:47,426
of these two main characters

535
00:16:47,486 --> 0:16:48,546
while solving puzzles.

536
00:16:49,946 --> 0:16:52,346
I am blown away by the artistry

537
00:16:52,346 --> 0:16:53,536
and cleverness in this game.

538
00:16:54,496 --> 0:16:56,456
And I've always just been really

539
00:16:56,456 --> 0:16:57,956
curious in how the developers

540
00:16:57,956 --> 0:16:59,686
arrived at this truly unique

541
00:16:59,766 --> 0:17:00,246
concept.

542
00:16:59,766 --> 0:17:00,246
concept.

543
00:17:01,926 --> 0:17:05,246
So I asked the developers and I

544
00:17:05,246 --> 0:17:06,455
hoped that they would be willing

545
00:17:06,455 --> 0:17:08,415
to share a few design artifacts

546
00:17:08,646 --> 0:17:10,266
that they created along the way

547
00:17:10,266 --> 0:17:11,096
while making The Gardens

548
00:17:11,096 --> 0:17:11,616
Between.

549
00:17:12,286 --> 0:17:13,526
And I expected to see a few

550
00:17:13,526 --> 0:17:14,976
familiar things that reminded me

551
00:17:14,976 --> 0:17:15,445
of the game.

552
00:17:17,136 --> 0:17:17,976
But I didn't.

553
00:17:19,046 --> 0:17:20,646
I was shocked to see that the

554
00:17:20,646 --> 0:17:22,445
design artifacts didn't look

555
00:17:22,445 --> 0:17:23,675
like the game at all.

556
00:17:24,266 --> 0:17:25,836
These images reveal that The

557
00:17:25,836 --> 0:17:27,336
Gardens Between started in a

558
00:17:27,336 --> 0:17:29,886
very different place, in a place

559
00:17:29,886 --> 0:17:32,596
of fairy tales with moments

560
00:17:32,666 --> 0:17:34,716
showing Snow White about to eat

561
00:17:34,716 --> 0:17:35,566
the poisoned apple.

562
00:17:36,546 --> 0:17:38,056
Or Sleeping Beauty right as

563
00:17:38,056 --> 0:17:39,426
she's about to fall into a curse

564
00:17:39,426 --> 0:17:40,686
of deep sleep.

565
00:17:41,326 --> 0:17:43,316
Other design artifacts showed

566
00:17:43,356 --> 0:17:46,306
lost characters and some very

567
00:17:46,306 --> 0:17:47,706
different appearances of the two

568
00:17:47,706 --> 0:17:49,466
main characters named Arina and

569
00:17:49,466 --> 0:17:49,836
Frendt.

570
00:17:50,796 --> 0:17:52,646
And various iterations on

571
00:17:52,646 --> 0:17:55,376
concepts for blocked paths and

572
00:17:55,376 --> 0:17:56,556
experiments with onscreen

573
00:17:56,556 --> 0:17:57,026
controls.

574
00:17:57,756 --> 0:18:00,016
As I flipped through all of

575
00:17:57,756 --> 0:18:00,016
As I flipped through all of

576
00:18:00,016 --> 0:18:01,896
these design artifacts, it

577
00:18:01,896 --> 0:18:04,056
became really clear to me the

578
00:18:04,056 --> 0:18:06,076
creative exploration that these

579
00:18:06,076 --> 0:18:07,946
developers put into making the

580
00:18:07,946 --> 0:18:09,456
game that we love today.

581
00:18:10,836 --> 0:18:11,816
There are tons of different

582
00:18:11,816 --> 0:18:14,596
styles and tones and directions

583
00:18:14,596 --> 0:18:15,896
and perspectives that were all

584
00:18:15,896 --> 0:18:16,446
considered.

585
00:18:17,496 --> 0:18:18,856
Now I know this is a game

586
00:18:18,856 --> 0:18:21,106
example but exploring ideas in

587
00:18:21,106 --> 0:18:22,746
your designs applies to apps

588
00:18:22,746 --> 0:18:22,956
too.

589
00:18:23,896 --> 0:18:25,156
All of these amazing design

590
00:18:25,156 --> 0:18:27,406
artifacts really show the power

591
00:18:27,406 --> 0:18:30,136
of refinement, what can happen

592
00:18:30,176 --> 0:18:32,286
when you take the time to truly

593
00:18:32,286 --> 0:18:33,326
explore your ideas.

594
00:18:34,126 --> 0:18:36,136
To stretch them, to think them

595
00:18:36,206 --> 0:18:38,126
through over time and to distill

596
00:18:38,126 --> 0:18:40,036
them down to their very essence.

597
00:18:41,766 --> 0:18:43,586
Now I love this quote by Carlton

598
00:18:43,586 --> 0:18:43,946
Cuse.

599
00:18:44,486 --> 0:18:45,406
I'm going to paraphrase it a

600
00:18:45,406 --> 0:18:47,976
bit, but it's basically saying

601
00:18:48,016 --> 0:18:49,946
that the creative process is not

602
00:18:49,946 --> 0:18:50,736
like getting struck by

603
00:18:50,736 --> 0:18:51,196
lightning.

604
00:18:52,036 --> 0:18:53,666
Along the way you must allow

605
00:18:53,666 --> 0:18:55,896
yourself room for ideas to

606
00:18:55,896 --> 0:19:00,376
blossom, take root and grow.

607
00:18:55,896 --> 0:19:00,376
blossom, take root and grow.

608
00:19:00,606 --> 0:19:02,986
So when you take the time to

609
00:19:02,986 --> 0:19:04,426
fully think through your ideas,

610
00:19:05,176 --> 0:19:07,246
you may discover new ones and

611
00:19:07,246 --> 0:19:08,906
then you can validate designs by

612
00:19:08,906 --> 0:19:11,146
refining them and in turn this

613
00:19:11,146 --> 0:19:12,756
gives people a sense of depth.

614
00:19:13,396 --> 0:19:14,856
And that really shines through

615
00:19:14,856 --> 0:19:16,406
the final experience in your app

616
00:19:16,656 --> 0:19:16,976
or game.

617
00:19:18,836 --> 0:19:21,046
Refined designs feel considered

618
00:19:21,046 --> 0:19:22,986
and they also feel thoughtful.

619
00:19:23,886 --> 0:19:25,586
But this all takes time.

620
00:19:25,666 --> 0:19:26,896
You can't rush this.

621
00:19:28,246 --> 0:19:31,676
And iteration is really helpful

622
00:19:31,676 --> 0:19:33,616
and also it's helpful for you to

623
00:19:33,616 --> 0:19:35,736
explore really wild directions

624
00:19:36,596 --> 0:19:38,626
in order to discover your

625
00:19:38,626 --> 0:19:39,286
conclusion.

626
00:19:40,636 --> 0:19:42,526
Now I really love that these

627
00:19:42,526 --> 0:19:44,036
developers were so open to

628
00:19:44,036 --> 0:19:45,196
sharing this incredible

629
00:19:45,196 --> 0:19:46,916
transformation of this beautiful

630
00:19:46,916 --> 0:19:48,486
game between two friends.

631
00:19:49,206 --> 0:19:51,056
And you can feel all of the time

632
00:19:51,056 --> 0:19:52,536
and effort that they put into

633
00:19:52,536 --> 0:19:53,816
honing this experience.

634
00:19:54,916 --> 0:19:56,206
And this experience is what we

635
00:19:56,206 --> 0:19:57,966
feel in the end result.

636
00:19:59,146 --> 0:20:00,876
Award-winning apps and games

637
00:19:59,146 --> 0:20:00,876
Award-winning apps and games

638
00:20:01,316 --> 0:20:02,826
rarely start with the same

639
00:20:02,826 --> 0:20:03,966
designs they finish with.

640
00:20:04,796 --> 0:20:06,736
And that's because great designs

641
00:20:06,916 --> 0:20:08,056
are refined over time.

642
00:20:08,886 --> 0:20:10,416
And through this process the

643
00:20:10,416 --> 0:20:13,956
very best ideas are surfaced.

644
00:20:14,086 --> 0:20:17,706
So take your time; explore and

645
00:20:17,706 --> 0:20:20,186
sit with your ideas because you

646
00:20:20,186 --> 0:20:21,526
may discover new ones through

647
00:20:21,526 --> 0:20:22,726
the process of doing your own

648
00:20:22,726 --> 0:20:23,026
work.

649
00:20:23,606 --> 0:20:25,536
And by refining your designs,

650
00:20:25,686 --> 0:20:26,506
you're going to be able to

651
00:20:26,506 --> 0:20:28,646
justify every design decision in

652
00:20:28,646 --> 0:20:30,766
your app or game, and as soon as

653
00:20:30,766 --> 0:20:32,576
you can justify those decisions,

654
00:20:33,046 --> 0:20:34,616
you know that you're much closer

655
00:20:34,616 --> 0:20:36,286
to the final result that you've

656
00:20:36,286 --> 0:20:37,646
been working towards the entire

657
00:20:37,646 --> 0:20:37,956
time.

658
00:20:39,496 --> 0:20:41,906
So all great apps and games go

659
00:20:41,906 --> 0:20:43,226
through the process of

660
00:20:43,226 --> 0:20:43,576
refinement.

661
00:20:44,476 --> 0:20:46,206
&gt;&gt; You know, Lauren, we actually

662
00:20:46,206 --> 0:20:47,856
have another great example of

663
00:20:47,856 --> 0:20:48,506
refinement.

664
00:20:49,656 --> 0:20:51,726
I want to talk about Butterfly

665
00:20:51,886 --> 0:20:52,216
iQ.

666
00:20:52,516 --> 0:20:54,596
Butterfly iQ is actually more

667
00:20:54,596 --> 0:20:55,126
than an app.

668
00:20:55,436 --> 0:20:57,656
It's portable ultrasound system,

669
00:20:57,976 --> 0:20:59,976
and the system itself is super

670
00:20:59,976 --> 0:21:00,596
innovative.

671
00:20:59,976 --> 0:21:00,596
innovative.

672
00:21:01,176 --> 0:21:03,436
A handheld ultrasound device and

673
00:21:03,436 --> 0:21:05,436
an app that runs on iPhone,

674
00:21:05,846 --> 0:21:06,896
that's what makes it up.

675
00:21:07,506 --> 0:21:08,836
So traditional ultrasound

676
00:21:08,836 --> 0:21:11,486
devices are gigantic.

677
00:21:11,976 --> 0:21:12,686
Really big.

678
00:21:12,986 --> 0:21:13,716
They're big.

679
00:21:13,716 --> 0:21:15,366
They have to be wheeled around

680
00:21:15,366 --> 0:21:16,966
on a cart and plugged in.

681
00:21:17,116 --> 0:21:19,706
They have dozens of knobs and

682
00:21:19,706 --> 0:21:22,106
dials and buttons on them.

683
00:21:22,986 --> 0:21:24,746
So you can really see in

684
00:21:24,746 --> 0:21:27,306
Butterfly iQ how the portability

685
00:21:27,506 --> 0:21:29,946
of their system can create a

686
00:21:30,036 --> 0:21:32,236
whole new way for doctors to use

687
00:21:32,236 --> 0:21:32,566
them.

688
00:21:32,906 --> 0:21:34,606
And I want to show you how the

689
00:21:34,606 --> 0:21:36,616
Butterfly iQ team refined their

690
00:21:36,616 --> 0:21:38,506
ideas to get to something that

691
00:21:38,506 --> 0:21:40,096
really works for doctors.

692
00:21:40,986 --> 0:21:42,906
So when a doctor is using the

693
00:21:42,906 --> 0:21:44,276
system, their attention is

694
00:21:44,276 --> 0:21:45,206
actually split.

695
00:21:45,316 --> 0:21:48,386
In one hand they have the device

696
00:21:48,426 --> 0:21:49,996
that they're orienting on the

697
00:21:49,996 --> 0:21:51,926
patient, and at the same time

698
00:21:52,266 --> 0:21:53,436
they're referring to the phone

699
00:21:53,436 --> 0:21:53,946
screen.

700
00:21:54,256 --> 0:21:55,406
So they need to be able to

701
00:21:55,406 --> 0:21:57,296
operate both one-handed.

702
00:21:58,856 --> 0:22:00,896
The app serves as kind of a

703
00:21:58,856 --> 0:22:00,896
The app serves as kind of a

704
00:22:00,896 --> 0:22:02,276
visual stethoscope.

705
00:22:02,276 --> 0:22:04,586
And the doctor needs to be able

706
00:22:04,586 --> 0:22:06,786
to quickly refer to and adjust

707
00:22:06,856 --> 0:22:08,676
the imagery and then to also

708
00:22:08,746 --> 0:22:11,616
access contextual tools to make

709
00:22:11,646 --> 0:22:12,976
measurements and notes.

710
00:22:14,856 --> 0:22:16,446
In their early demos, they

711
00:22:16,446 --> 0:22:18,676
created controls that mirrored

712
00:22:18,676 --> 0:22:20,276
the controls from the ultrasound

713
00:22:20,276 --> 0:22:22,196
cart with the idea that this

714
00:22:22,196 --> 0:22:24,206
would feel familiar to doctors.

715
00:22:25,206 --> 0:22:28,836
So the two values on the right

716
00:22:29,666 --> 0:22:30,656
tell you how deep you're

717
00:22:30,656 --> 0:22:31,206
looking.

718
00:22:31,346 --> 0:22:32,756
That's the depth.

719
00:22:32,946 --> 0:22:34,526
And the amount of contrast

720
00:22:34,736 --> 0:22:36,256
you're applying, that's the

721
00:22:36,256 --> 0:22:36,786
gain.

722
00:22:37,456 --> 0:22:39,086
And they borrowed the behavior

723
00:22:39,086 --> 0:22:40,676
of these buttons from the knobs

724
00:22:40,896 --> 0:22:42,336
on the cart when doctors would

725
00:22:42,336 --> 0:22:43,196
interact with them.

726
00:22:44,046 --> 0:22:45,556
So in the early version, the

727
00:22:45,556 --> 0:22:48,246
doctor would spin these controls

728
00:22:48,246 --> 0:22:50,656
like the dial in a cart and the

729
00:22:50,656 --> 0:22:53,866
dials in the phone in doing this

730
00:22:53,866 --> 0:22:55,556
kind of matched the behavior

731
00:22:55,556 --> 0:22:56,996
that the Butterfly iQ team

732
00:22:57,066 --> 0:22:58,726
thought would be very familiar

733
00:22:58,726 --> 0:22:59,666
and very comfortable.

734
00:23:01,016 --> 0:23:03,626
So in UI terms, they're kind of

735
00:23:03,626 --> 0:23:05,106
implementing a metaphorical

736
00:23:05,106 --> 0:23:05,606
dial.

737
00:23:05,876 --> 0:23:07,316
And metaphors like this can be

738
00:23:07,316 --> 0:23:09,566
super useful when you want to

739
00:23:09,686 --> 0:23:11,776
help the person using the device

740
00:23:11,906 --> 0:23:14,066
create a connection with a

741
00:23:14,066 --> 0:23:15,106
real-world object.

742
00:23:15,326 --> 0:23:17,036
And metaphors are all over the

743
00:23:17,036 --> 0:23:19,106
place in UI's, right?

744
00:23:19,176 --> 0:23:21,096
This is a metaphorical

745
00:23:21,276 --> 0:23:22,786
calculator with metaphorical

746
00:23:23,016 --> 0:23:23,776
buttons.

747
00:23:25,036 --> 0:23:28,016
And our expectations of using

748
00:23:28,016 --> 0:23:29,766
that calculator come from the

749
00:23:30,046 --> 0:23:32,576
behavior that we've built up in

750
00:23:32,576 --> 0:23:34,596
the real world using real-world

751
00:23:34,946 --> 0:23:35,806
buttons like these.

752
00:23:36,466 --> 0:23:39,536
But as the Butterfly iQ team

753
00:23:39,536 --> 0:23:42,486
tested that demo, that 2016

754
00:23:42,486 --> 0:23:44,436
demo, they found that a direct

755
00:23:44,436 --> 0:23:46,426
translation of the dial didn't

756
00:23:46,496 --> 0:23:48,186
feel right at all to doctors

757
00:23:48,546 --> 0:23:50,426
because those values were taking

758
00:23:50,846 --> 0:23:52,726
up valuable real estate.

759
00:23:53,436 --> 0:23:55,696
So they refined it on this

760
00:23:55,696 --> 0:23:56,096
theme.

761
00:23:56,256 --> 0:23:58,656
They started by looking at other

762
00:23:58,656 --> 0:24:00,656
apps and solved the problem --

763
00:23:58,656 --> 0:24:00,656
apps and solved the problem --

764
00:24:00,896 --> 0:24:02,296
how other apps had solved the

765
00:24:02,296 --> 0:24:04,446
problem of viewing and editing

766
00:24:04,446 --> 0:24:04,996
imagery.

767
00:24:05,356 --> 0:24:07,116
And they drew inspiration from

768
00:24:07,116 --> 0:24:08,776
the iOS Camera app.

769
00:24:09,576 --> 0:24:11,926
So they considered the ways that

770
00:24:11,926 --> 0:24:13,676
people expect to interact with

771
00:24:13,676 --> 0:24:15,076
objects in the camera view and

772
00:24:15,076 --> 0:24:17,396
the ways that controls can be

773
00:24:17,396 --> 0:24:19,026
accessed via gestures.

774
00:24:19,126 --> 0:24:20,646
The way that those controls

775
00:24:20,646 --> 0:24:22,466
animate in and then the way that

776
00:24:22,466 --> 0:24:24,056
they recede when they're not in

777
00:24:24,056 --> 0:24:24,476
use.

778
00:24:25,696 --> 0:24:28,126
So now in the Butterfly iQ app,

779
00:24:28,566 --> 0:24:30,286
panning left and right changes

780
00:24:30,336 --> 0:24:33,646
the contrast and swiping up and

781
00:24:33,646 --> 0:24:35,336
down changes the depth.

782
00:24:35,886 --> 0:24:37,976
So they moved the information

783
00:24:38,056 --> 0:24:40,226
out of the UI and allowed it to

784
00:24:40,226 --> 0:24:41,806
be accessed via gestures.

785
00:24:42,706 --> 0:24:43,886
And you can notice the ruler

786

down the right-hand side.

787
00:24:45,626 --> 0:24:47,396
So as the doctor swipes down,

788
00:24:47,396 --> 0:24:49,056
that ruler extends and allows

789
00:24:49,056 --> 0:24:50,396

00:24:54,886 --> 0:24:56,316
So transferring the persistent

00:24:56,316 --> 0:24:58,596

establish trust and comfort.

797
00:25:03,326 --> 0:25:04,666
But instead it turned out that

798
00:25:04,776 --> 0:25:06,616
that information and those dials

799
00:25:06,616 --> 0:25:08,196
were occupying valuable real

800
00:25:08,196 --> 0:25:09,686
estate and doctors didn't need

801
00:25:09,686 --> 0:25:11,196
that persistence in order to

802
00:25:11,196 --> 0:25:12,636
feel confident.

803
00:25:14,136 --> 0:25:17,126
So creating those metaphorical

804
00:25:17,126 --> 0:25:18,486
connections can be helpful, but

805
00:25:18,486 --> 0:25:21,036
there's no copy and paste when

00:25:26,636 --> 0:25:28,146

You know if you make a mistake,

981
00:30:20,846 --> 0:30:22,876
well, it's on you.

982
00:30:23,796 --> 0:30:26,196
Thumper Pocket Edition captures

983
00:30:26,276 --> 0:30:27,076
your attention.

984
00:30:27,266 --> 0:30:29,586
It captivates your senses and it

985
00:30:29,586 --> 0:30:31,746
lures you in through its unique

986
00:30:31,746 --> 0:30:33,656
aesthetic to create an

987
00:30:33,886 --> 0:30:35,106
absolutely beautiful and

988
00:30:35,106 --> 0:30:36,176
immersive experience.

989
00:30:37,216 --> 0:30:38,876
&gt;&gt; So aesthetics can be

990
00:30:38,876 --> 0:30:40,786
captivating and immersive, but I

991
00:30:40,786 --> 0:30:42,706
want to highlight the practical

992
00:30:42,706 --> 0:30:44,106
benefits that they can have as

993
00:30:44,106 --> 0:30:44,456
well.

994
00:30:44,596 --> 0:30:46,056
And I want to show you a game

995
00:30:46,056 --> 0:30:46,896
called ELOH.

996
00:30:47,376 --> 0:30:51,126
ELOH uses unique visual style in

997
00:30:51,126 --> 0:30:52,716
a couple of really practical

998
00:30:52,716 --> 0:30:53,296
ways.

999
00:30:54,316 --> 0:30:56,956
So it's a casual puzzle game and

1000
00:30:57,066 --> 0:30:59,616
it combines some familiar game

1001
00:30:59,616 --> 0:31:01,756
elements like the bouncing balls

1002
00:30:59,616 --> 0:31:01,756
elements like the bouncing balls

1003
00:31:01,756 --> 0:31:03,226
and the movable obstacles.

1004
00:31:03,766 --> 0:31:06,886
And this looks and feels very

1005
00:31:07,006 --> 0:31:08,836
complete, so I want to show you

1006
00:31:08,836 --> 0:31:10,566
where they started and how they

1007
00:31:10,566 --> 0:31:11,156
got here.

1008
00:31:12,776 --> 0:31:14,576
So this is an alpha version of

1009
00:31:14,576 --> 0:31:14,946
ELOH.

1010
00:31:15,786 --> 0:31:17,466
So you can see that the puzzle

1011
00:31:17,466 --> 0:31:18,406
elements are there.

1012
00:31:18,936 --> 0:31:21,416
The essential mechanic is there,

1013
00:31:21,596 --> 0:31:23,076
the sounds, and it's even got

1014
00:31:23,516 --> 0:31:25,336
kind of a notion of the style

1015
00:31:25,336 --> 0:31:28,606
with the anthropomorphic face on

1016
00:31:28,606 --> 0:31:29,746
the obstacle.

1017
00:31:30,216 --> 0:31:31,646
And this is an example of a

1018
00:31:31,646 --> 0:31:33,306
higher level in that alpha.

1019
00:31:33,776 --> 0:31:36,846
Neither of these really resemble

1020
00:31:36,846 --> 0:31:38,736
the first screen that I showed

1021
00:31:38,736 --> 0:31:39,056
you.

1022
00:31:39,116 --> 0:31:40,986
But it's clear that they've got

1023
00:31:40,986 --> 0:31:43,686
kind of the mechanic nailed in

1024
00:31:44,016 --> 0:31:45,596
these early versions.

1025
00:31:45,896 --> 0:31:46,846
So I want to walk you through

1026
00:31:46,846 --> 0:31:48,086
the journey that they took from

1027
00:31:48,186 --> 0:31:51,746
here to arrive at the game

1028
00:31:51,746 --> 0:31:53,166
that's on the App Store.

1029
00:31:53,916 --> 0:31:55,136
So the first step that the game

1030
00:31:55,136 --> 0:31:56,846
designer took was to hire an

1031
00:31:56,846 --> 0:31:57,576
illustrator.

1032
00:31:57,856 --> 0:32:01,036
And the illustrator explored a

1033
00:31:57,856 --> 0:32:01,036
And the illustrator explored a

1034
00:32:01,036 --> 0:32:03,426
color system and a graphic style

1035
00:32:03,836 --> 0:32:05,206
and just in looking at those

1036
00:32:05,246 --> 0:32:07,186
three examples, you could see

1037
00:32:07,186 --> 0:32:10,086
how different the game could

1038
00:32:10,086 --> 0:32:11,996
have been given the different

1039
00:32:11,996 --> 0:32:13,466
tones and styles that he

1040
00:32:13,466 --> 0:32:13,826
explored.

1041
00:32:16,046 --> 0:32:18,886
So an app or game can be

1042
00:32:18,976 --> 0:32:20,966
functional without being

1043
00:32:20,966 --> 0:32:23,256
beautiful, but the beauty that

1044
00:32:23,256 --> 0:32:24,576
ELOH's designer brought into the

1045
00:32:24,576 --> 0:32:26,506
game does more than make it look

1046
00:32:26,506 --> 0:32:26,846
good.

1047
00:32:27,826 --> 0:32:29,706
It enhances the gameplay and

1048
00:32:29,706 --> 0:32:31,716
brings visibility and life to

1049
00:32:31,716 --> 0:32:32,966
the interactive elements.

1050
00:32:33,506 --> 0:32:35,126
There aren't many interactive

1051
00:32:35,126 --> 0:32:36,226
elements in the game, so they

1052
00:32:36,226 --> 0:32:37,886
took care with each one, like

1053
00:32:37,886 --> 0:32:39,376
this button that appears when

1054
00:32:39,376 --> 0:32:40,766
you solve a puzzle.

1055
00:32:42,096 --> 0:32:43,746
And the visual detail allowed

1056
00:32:43,746 --> 0:32:45,106
the characters to really come

1057
00:32:45,106 --> 0:32:45,636
alive.

1058
00:32:46,126 --> 0:32:48,286
These little guys have so much

1059
00:32:48,286 --> 0:32:49,196
personality.

1060
00:32:49,496 --> 0:32:51,186
When you drag an obstacle from

1061
00:32:51,186 --> 0:32:53,606
place to place or when a ball

1062
00:32:53,606 --> 0:32:54,956
hits it, it responds.

1063
00:32:55,496 --> 0:32:57,396
And those small moments were

1064
00:32:57,396 --> 0:32:58,976
really carefully considered.

1065
00:32:59,466 --> 0:33:00,366
You could just tell that the

1066
00:32:59,466 --> 0:33:00,366
You could just tell that the

1067
00:33:00,366 --> 0:33:02,236
animators were thinking about

1068
00:33:02,236 --> 0:33:03,966
what the face should look like

1069
00:33:04,116 --> 0:33:06,346
when the ball hits it or when a

1070
00:33:06,346 --> 0:33:08,726
finger pushes down on it.

1071
00:33:09,296 --> 0:33:09,976
Pretty amazing.

1072
00:33:12,046 --> 0:33:13,426
And the team brought in a sound

1073
00:33:13,426 --> 0:33:13,986
designer.

1074
00:33:14,276 --> 0:33:16,076
The sounds feel natural.

1075
00:33:16,556 --> 0:33:18,686
When you succeed, the sounds are

1076
00:33:18,686 --> 0:33:20,686
rhythmic, and the sound adapts

1077
00:33:21,266 --> 0:33:23,446
to build drama and suspense

1078
00:33:23,676 --> 0:33:25,106
within each level and between

1079
00:33:25,106 --> 0:33:25,526
levels.

1080
00:33:26,946 --> 0:33:28,726
So ELOH's aesthetics also deepen

1081
00:33:28,726 --> 0:33:29,546
the experience.

1082
00:33:29,686 --> 0:33:31,466
They connect emotionally with

1083
00:33:31,466 --> 0:33:33,656
people while also reinforcing

1084
00:33:33,656 --> 0:33:34,946
the intent of the game.

1085
00:33:36,356 --> 0:33:37,786
So I want to make one more

1086
00:33:37,786 --> 0:33:38,926
subtle point on this.

1087
00:33:39,136 --> 0:33:40,906
The people that came together to

1088
00:33:40,906 --> 0:33:43,556
create ELOH put so much work

1089
00:33:43,556 --> 0:33:44,796
into the game, and I want to

1090
00:33:44,796 --> 0:33:45,936
talk about a subtle thing that

1091
00:33:45,936 --> 0:33:48,346
they did to give people a chance

1092
00:33:48,486 --> 0:33:50,356
to enjoy the gameplay and the

1093
00:33:50,356 --> 0:33:50,976
game's beauty.

1094
00:33:53,326 --> 0:33:54,186
So they mentioned something

1095
00:33:54,186 --> 0:33:55,326
interesting when I asked where

1096
00:33:55,326 --> 0:33:56,426
the game came from.

1097
00:33:56,946 --> 0:33:58,136
They said that modern puzzle

1098
00:33:58,136 --> 0:34:00,486
games often fail to create

1099
00:33:58,136 --> 0:34:00,486
games often fail to create

1100
00:34:00,486 --> 0:34:02,906
long-lasting excitement because

1101
00:34:02,906 --> 0:34:04,346
the only thing that happens is

1102
00:34:04,346 --> 0:34:05,546
that the puzzles just get harder

1103
00:34:05,546 --> 0:34:06,086
and harder.

1104
00:34:07,516 --> 0:34:09,346
What's fun about that?

1105
00:34:10,136 --> 0:34:11,696
Every puzzle game gets

1106
00:34:11,696 --> 0:34:13,156
annoyingly difficult at some

1107
00:34:13,156 --> 0:34:15,235
point and it's easy to just want

1108
00:34:15,235 --> 0:34:15,565
to quit.

1109
00:34:15,926 --> 0:34:17,746
But in ELOH, every once in a

1110
00:34:17,746 --> 0:34:18,946
while when you finish an

1111
00:34:18,946 --> 0:34:21,005
especially hard level, you find

1112
00:34:21,005 --> 0:34:23,085
out that the next one is much

1113
00:34:23,085 --> 0:34:23,726
simpler.

1114
00:34:24,386 --> 0:34:26,956
And the aesthetics rise to the

1115
00:34:26,956 --> 0:34:29,676
surface again and you can notice

1116
00:34:29,775 --> 0:34:31,596
the craft of the characters and

1117
00:34:31,596 --> 0:34:32,876
appreciate the rhythm of the

1118
00:34:32,876 --> 0:34:33,525
soundtrack.

1119
00:34:34,106 --> 0:34:35,346
Or turning the page.

1120
00:34:35,706 --> 0:34:36,536
Ah.

1121
00:34:36,976 --> 0:34:37,335
&gt;&gt; So nice.

1122
00:34:37,726 --> 0:34:38,406
&gt;&gt; Simpler.

1123
00:34:40,545 --> 0:34:41,696
So that's what I mean by the

1124
00:34:41,696 --> 0:34:42,956
aesthetics having a practical

1125
00:34:42,956 --> 0:34:43,485
benefit.

1126
00:34:43,536 --> 0:34:45,275
The design matches the intent of

1127
00:34:45,275 --> 0:34:47,565
the game, and the casual fun

1128
00:34:47,616 --> 0:34:49,505
resurfaces every so often as you

1129
00:34:49,505 --> 0:34:51,795
progress through 99 levels.

1130
00:34:52,505 --> 0:34:56,076
So we expect aesthetics to be

1131
00:34:56,076 --> 0:34:58,426
embodied in every element of the

1132
00:34:58,426 --> 0:34:59,776
app, and I want to show you one

1133
00:34:59,776 --> 0:35:01,936
more quick thing that I think is

1134
00:34:59,776 --> 0:35:01,936
more quick thing that I think is

1135
00:35:01,936 --> 0:35:02,556
awesome.

1136
00:35:03,546 --> 0:35:05,606
The HomeCourt team really

1137
00:35:05,606 --> 0:35:07,216
sweated the details with their

1138
00:35:07,216 --> 0:35:08,116
app icon.

1139
00:35:09,056 --> 0:35:11,156
The shapes in the icon clearly

1140
00:35:11,156 --> 0:35:12,436
draw inspiration from the

1141
00:35:12,436 --> 0:35:15,006
elements of a basketball court.

1142
00:35:15,596 --> 0:35:17,306
So a great app icon allows

1143
00:35:17,306 --> 0:35:18,836
people to quickly scan their

1144
00:35:18,836 --> 0:35:21,016
home screen and map what they

1145
00:35:21,016 --> 0:35:22,856
want to do to the intent of the

1146
00:35:22,856 --> 0:35:23,136
app.

1147
00:35:24,246 --> 0:35:26,376
The H and the C of HomeCourt

1148
00:35:26,416 --> 0:35:27,936
emerge from the boundary lines

1149
00:35:27,936 --> 0:35:28,976
of the basketball court.

1150
00:35:28,976 --> 0:35:31,546
And the background is a clear

1151
00:35:31,606 --> 0:35:32,976
call-out to the orange of a

1152
00:35:32,976 --> 0:35:33,616
basketball.

1153
00:35:33,616 --> 0:35:34,976
&gt;&gt; That's pretty cool, Doug.

1154
00:35:35,456 --> 0:35:35,766
&gt;&gt; Right?

1155
00:35:36,216 --> 0:35:37,946
&gt;&gt; Yeah. But I don't remember

1156
00:35:37,946 --> 0:35:39,336
HomeCourt being in our agenda to

1157
00:35:39,336 --> 0:35:40,516
be talking about aesthetics.

1158
00:35:40,936 --> 0:35:41,016
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

1159
00:35:41,206 --> 0:35:42,426
&gt;&gt; We were supposed to be

1160
00:35:42,426 --> 0:35:45,286
talking about Thumper, ELOH and

1161
00:35:45,286 --> 0:35:45,616
Ordia.

1162
00:35:47,476 --> 0:35:48,496
&gt;&gt; What more is there to say?

1163
00:35:48,496 --> 0:35:48,686
[Laughs]

1164
00:35:48,686 --> 0:35:50,796
&gt;&gt; Well, I just want to make

1165
00:35:50,796 --> 0:35:52,026
sure we have time to talk about

1166
00:35:52,026 --> 0:35:53,986
how aesthetics can create

1167
00:35:53,986 --> 0:35:55,196
something that feels really

1168
00:35:55,196 --> 0:35:55,676
cohesive.

1169
00:35:55,676 --> 0:35:57,846
And that aesthetics can give an

1170
00:35:58,586 --> 0:36:00,186
app a perception of quality

1171
00:35:58,586 --> 0:36:00,186
app a perception of quality

1172
00:36:00,526 --> 0:36:01,816
through a really clear and

1173
00:36:01,816 --> 0:36:03,136
consistent design language.

1174
00:36:03,866 --> 0:36:05,906
Now Ordia is a game that tells a

1175
00:36:05,906 --> 0:36:07,256
story about the struggles of

1176
00:36:07,376 --> 0:36:08,756
early primordial life.

1177
00:36:09,646 --> 0:36:11,296
And I just love the organic

1178
00:36:11,296 --> 0:36:13,136
blobbiness of everything in

1179
00:36:13,136 --> 0:36:15,386
Ordia, from the menus to the

1180
00:36:15,386 --> 0:36:18,376
transitions, levels, characters.

1181
00:36:18,686 --> 0:36:19,946
I mean, this blobby theme is

1182
00:36:19,996 --> 0:36:21,486
carried through everything in

1183
00:36:21,486 --> 0:36:22,846
the entire game experience.

1184
00:36:23,576 --> 0:36:25,036
There's also clever sound design

1185
00:36:25,036 --> 0:36:26,406
and haptics to create a really

1186
00:36:26,406 --> 0:36:28,526
rich atmosphere to enhance this

1187
00:36:28,526 --> 0:36:30,056
incredibly sticky world.

1188
00:36:30,926 --> 0:36:32,936
And every screen sticks

1189
00:36:32,966 --> 0:36:33,406
together.

1190
00:36:33,946 --> 0:36:35,396
They family really well.

1191
00:36:36,226 --> 0:36:37,776
Ordia's design language is

1192
00:36:37,776 --> 0:36:38,596
meaningful.

1193
00:36:38,876 --> 0:36:40,306
It helps communicate to people

1194
00:36:40,306 --> 0:36:42,866
what's interactive, what isn't,

1195
00:36:43,096 --> 0:36:44,836
and also the colors help people

1196
00:36:44,836 --> 0:36:46,136
know what's friendly when it's

1197
00:36:46,136 --> 0:36:46,816
in the game.

1198
00:36:48,226 --> 0:36:50,366
So to quote the developer, they

1199
00:36:50,366 --> 0:36:52,066
wanted to have the player always

1200
00:36:52,166 --> 0:36:53,346
feel like they were in the same

1201
00:36:53,346 --> 0:36:53,976
environment.

1202
00:36:55,086 --> 0:36:56,706
The same environment.

1203
00:36:56,706 --> 0:36:58,236
I think that's a great goal for

1204
00:36:58,236 --> 0:36:59,336
your app or game.

1205
00:36:59,996 --> 0:37:01,716
To create cohesion and

1206
00:36:59,996 --> 0:37:01,716
To create cohesion and

1207
00:37:01,716 --> 0:37:03,776
consistency between every aspect

1208
00:37:03,776 --> 0:37:04,536
of your design.

1209
00:37:05,816 --> 0:37:07,726
So your app or game also needs

1210
00:37:07,726 --> 0:37:09,076
to feel connected to the

1211
00:37:09,076 --> 0:37:10,726
platform to be truly cohesive.

1212
00:37:11,346 --> 0:37:12,936
So you can tell that Ordia was

1213
00:37:12,966 --> 0:37:14,916
designed for iOS just by taking

1214
00:37:14,916 --> 0:37:16,386
a look at the Share icon.

1215
00:37:17,166 --> 0:37:18,886
This seemingly simple design

1216
00:37:18,886 --> 0:37:20,726
decision makes a really big

1217
00:37:20,726 --> 0:37:22,306
difference in helping people

1218
00:37:22,646 --> 0:37:24,446
understand your app and also

1219
00:37:24,446 --> 0:37:26,046
making it feel at home in the

1220
00:37:26,046 --> 0:37:27,206
platform it runs on.

1221
00:37:28,426 --> 0:37:30,006
Now I know it's really hard work

1222
00:37:30,376 --> 0:37:32,766
to create designs that stick

1223
00:37:32,836 --> 0:37:34,726
together, especially when it

1224
00:37:34,756 --> 0:37:36,496
feels like creating an app or

1225
00:37:36,496 --> 0:37:39,406
game can be an endless upwards

1226
00:37:39,406 --> 0:37:39,886
climb.

1227
00:37:41,236 --> 0:37:43,036
But by creating a cohesive

1228
00:37:43,036 --> 0:37:45,106
design, it raises the overall

1229
00:37:45,106 --> 0:37:46,436
quality of your experience.

1230
00:37:47,186 --> 0:37:49,096
So to make your app or game

1231
00:37:49,096 --> 0:37:51,416
cohesive, create a consistent

1232
00:37:51,416 --> 0:37:52,296
design language.

1233
00:37:53,316 --> 0:37:55,386
Lay out every single screen

1234
00:37:55,386 --> 0:37:57,486
side-by-side and ask yourself,

1235
00:37:58,076 --> 0:37:59,986
does anything feel out of place?

1236
00:38:00,726 --> 0:38:02,076
And if it does, replace it with

1237
00:38:02,076 --> 0:38:03,346
something that families better.

1238
00:38:04,266 --> 0:38:05,886
And finally, cohesiveness

1239
00:38:05,886 --> 0:38:08,046
applies to how your app or game

1240
00:38:08,046 --> 0:38:09,136
runs on the platform.

1241
00:38:09,906 --> 0:38:11,396
And just to tie this all back to

1242
00:38:11,496 --> 0:38:13,986
aesthetics, in Thumper aesthetic

1243
00:38:13,986 --> 0:38:15,986
beauty helped create immersion.

1244
00:38:17,206 --> 0:38:18,226
&gt;&gt; ELOH shows how these

1245
00:38:18,226 --> 0:38:19,856
aesthetics support the intended

1246
00:38:19,856 --> 0:38:21,516
behavior or experience.

1247
00:38:22,296 --> 0:38:23,826
And aesthetics are embodied in

1248
00:38:23,906 --> 0:38:25,456
every element of the app, down

1249
00:38:25,456 --> 0:38:26,286
to its icon.

1250
00:38:26,876 --> 0:38:27,176
&gt;&gt; Nice.

1251
00:38:29,476 --> 0:38:30,786
And creating consistent

1252
00:38:30,786 --> 0:38:32,806
experience is really important

1253
00:38:32,976 --> 0:38:34,926
with a cohesive design language.

1254
00:38:35,066 --> 0:38:35,156
&gt;&gt; Okay.

1255
00:38:36,066 --> 0:38:36,776
&gt;&gt; And that's aesthetics.

1256
00:38:37,376 --> 0:38:39,536
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So let's go on to the

1257
00:38:39,536 --> 0:38:41,096
next subtle theme running

1258
00:38:41,096 --> 0:38:43,096
through all great apps, and

1259
00:38:43,096 --> 0:38:44,546
that's that they're inclusive.

1260
00:38:45,606 --> 0:38:47,156
So when we talk about inclusion

1261
00:38:47,156 --> 0:38:48,406
in design, we mean that

1262
00:38:48,406 --> 0:38:50,246
interfaces are usable by

1263
00:38:50,246 --> 0:38:50,896
everyone.

1264
00:38:51,816 --> 0:38:52,996
So let's go back to Pixelmator

1265
00:38:52,996 --> 0:38:54,776
Photo for just a moment and look

1266
00:38:54,776 --> 0:38:56,266
at one of the benefits of using

1267
00:38:56,266 --> 0:38:58,146
native components to ensure as

1268
00:38:58,146 --> 0:38:59,906
many people as possible can use

1269
00:38:59,906 --> 0:39:00,346
your app.

1270
00:38:59,906 --> 0:39:00,346
your app.

1271
00:39:01,456 --> 0:39:03,006
I want to focus on one element:

1272
00:39:03,036 --> 0:39:04,706
the native UI switch.

1273
00:39:04,966 --> 0:39:06,816
Here it works nicely as a way of

1274
00:39:06,816 --> 0:39:08,576
activating or deactivating

1275
00:39:08,576 --> 0:39:09,396
parameters.

1276
00:39:10,356 --> 0:39:11,866
It clearly communicates the

1277
00:39:11,866 --> 0:39:13,516
state of each parameter and

1278
00:39:13,516 --> 0:39:15,736
provides a way to remove it and

1279
00:39:15,736 --> 0:39:17,306
add it again without losing

1280
00:39:17,306 --> 0:39:17,546
work.

1281
00:39:18,786 --> 0:39:20,796
When I asked the Pixelmator team

1282
00:39:20,836 --> 0:39:22,766
about this, they said originally

1283
00:39:23,016 --> 0:39:23,976
they were going to bring over

1284
00:39:23,976 --> 0:39:28,116
the controls from their Mac app.

1285
00:39:28,176 --> 0:39:29,666
And while the appearance is

1286
00:39:29,666 --> 0:39:31,416
similar, the checkboxes don't

1287
00:39:31,416 --> 0:39:34,386
pop or communicate as clearly as

1288
00:39:34,746 --> 0:39:35,366
the switch.

1289
00:39:35,916 --> 0:39:39,276
And not only is the switch a

1290
00:39:39,276 --> 0:39:42,716
familiar iOS element, it's also

1291
00:39:42,796 --> 0:39:43,496
accessible.

1292
00:39:43,886 --> 0:39:45,506
In the Accessibility section of

1293
00:39:45,506 --> 0:39:47,016
the Settings app, people can

1294
00:39:47,016 --> 0:39:48,656
turn on labels that allow these

1295
00:39:48,656 --> 0:39:50,176
switches to be even more

1296
00:39:50,366 --> 0:39:50,856
legible.

1297
00:39:52,696 --> 0:39:54,646
So using standard components

1298
00:39:54,686 --> 0:39:56,186
creates consistency,

1299
00:39:56,186 --> 0:39:58,086
predictability and legibility

1300
00:39:58,876 --> 0:40:00,716
across apps and devices.

1301
00:39:58,876 --> 0:40:00,716
across apps and devices.

1302
00:40:02,186 --> 0:40:03,246
So Lauren, I know you have an

1303
00:40:03,246 --> 0:40:04,796
awesome example of inclusion as

1304
00:40:04,796 --> 0:40:05,086
well.

1305
00:40:05,456 --> 0:40:06,246
&gt;&gt; Yeah, totally.

1306
00:40:06,246 --> 0:40:08,226
I want to go back to Ordia.

1307
00:40:09,446 --> 0:40:11,626
Now in Ordia, every creature has

1308
00:40:11,626 --> 0:40:13,186
a color that communicates to the

1309
00:40:13,246 --> 0:40:15,646
player whether it's good, bad or

1310
00:40:15,646 --> 0:40:17,306
meant to aid in navigation.

1311
00:40:17,966 --> 0:40:19,056
The developer didn't want to

1312
00:40:19,056 --> 0:40:20,706
exclude anyone from being able

1313
00:40:20,706 --> 0:40:22,326
to understand the game, so they

1314
00:40:22,326 --> 0:40:23,936
support a colorblind mode for

1315
00:40:23,936 --> 0:40:24,806
people with partial

1316
00:40:24,806 --> 0:40:25,576
colorblindness.

1317
00:40:26,456 --> 0:40:27,866
To create this, the developers

1318
00:40:27,866 --> 0:40:29,146
took screenshots of the game,

1319
00:40:29,576 --> 0:40:31,256
applied filters to stimulate

1320
00:40:31,256 --> 0:40:31,956
different types of

1321
00:40:31,956 --> 0:40:33,806
colorblindness and then worked

1322
00:40:33,806 --> 0:40:35,616
on rebalancing those colors to

1323
00:40:35,616 --> 0:40:36,546
make them more distinct.

1324
00:40:37,636 --> 0:40:39,916
And they made every single

1325
00:40:39,916 --> 0:40:41,666
design element distinctive to

1326
00:40:41,666 --> 0:40:43,156
include people with full

1327
00:40:43,156 --> 0:40:44,056
colorblindness.

1328
00:40:44,406 --> 0:40:46,266
So they also tested the game in

1329
00:40:46,266 --> 0:40:47,326
pure monochrome.

1330
00:40:48,356 --> 0:40:50,366
With over 300 million people

1331
00:40:50,366 --> 0:40:52,316
worldwide with some form of

1332
00:40:52,316 --> 0:40:54,216
colorblindness, Ordia is

1333
00:40:54,316 --> 0:40:55,486
wonderfully inclusive.

1334
00:40:56,416 --> 0:40:59,186
So to get started, design for

1335
00:40:59,256 --> 0:41:01,416
everyone and investigate if your

1336
00:40:59,256 --> 0:41:01,416
everyone and investigate if your

1337
00:41:01,416 --> 0:41:03,276
app or game is inclusive and

1338
00:41:03,276 --> 0:41:03,796
accessible.

1339
00:41:04,476 --> 0:41:05,486
&gt;&gt; More and more Apple

1340
00:41:05,486 --> 0:41:06,716
frameworks and elements are made

1341
00:41:06,716 --> 0:41:08,856
accessible with each release, so

1342
00:41:08,936 --> 0:41:10,316
the more you use native

1343
00:41:10,316 --> 0:41:11,946
frameworks, the more people will

1344
00:41:11,946 --> 0:41:13,416
be able to use your app.

1345
00:41:14,196 --> 0:41:15,186
&gt;&gt; All right, we're in the home

1346
00:41:15,186 --> 0:41:15,636
stretch.

1347
00:41:15,806 --> 0:41:16,336
Hang tight.

1348
00:41:16,966 --> 0:41:17,986
We're going to move on to

1349
00:41:17,986 --> 0:41:19,346
attention to detail.

1350
00:41:19,706 --> 0:41:21,396
&gt;&gt; Attention to detail is a core

1351
00:41:21,396 --> 0:41:22,366
value at Apple.

1352
00:41:22,366 --> 0:41:23,866
It's something we strive to do

1353
00:41:24,046 --> 0:41:25,276
in everything that we do.

1354
00:41:25,806 --> 0:41:27,386
&gt;&gt; Meticulous and deliberately

1355
00:41:27,386 --> 0:41:29,356
designed apps and games are the

1356
00:41:29,356 --> 0:41:31,676
outcome of hard work, the desire

1357
00:41:31,676 --> 0:41:34,176
for perfection, and it's also a

1358
00:41:34,346 --> 0:41:36,306
telltale sign that the people

1359
00:41:36,306 --> 0:41:37,836
that created the app or game

1360
00:41:38,136 --> 0:41:39,886
cared about every single aspect

1361
00:41:39,886 --> 0:41:42,046
of the experience down to the

1362
00:41:42,666 --> 0:41:43,536
last pixel.

1363
00:41:43,656 --> 0:41:45,966
So let's talk about Flow by

1364
00:41:45,966 --> 0:41:46,586
Moleskine.

1365
00:41:47,456 --> 0:41:49,016
This is a drawing app that has a

1366
00:41:49,016 --> 0:41:51,206
continual horizontal canvas with

1367
00:41:51,206 --> 0:41:52,806
a fully customizable set of

1368
00:41:52,886 --> 0:41:53,206
tools.

1369
00:41:54,016 --> 0:41:56,316
This app has one goal and it's

1370
00:41:56,316 --> 0:41:58,316
to help you stay in a state of

1371
00:41:58,316 --> 0:41:59,316
creative flow.

1372
00:42:00,106 --> 0:42:01,096
Now we're just going to focus in

1373
00:42:01,096 --> 0:42:02,676
on one element of this app that

1374
00:42:02,676 --> 0:42:04,676
showcases a tremendous amount of

1375
00:42:04,676 --> 0:42:05,696
attention to detail.

1376
00:42:06,896 --> 0:42:08,786
Flow's tool and color selector

1377
00:42:08,786 --> 0:42:10,366
is one of the most comprehensive

1378
00:42:10,366 --> 0:42:11,876
and easy to use that we have

1379
00:42:12,076 --> 0:42:12,726
ever seen.

1380
00:42:13,506 --> 0:42:14,736
Now you can tell how much the

1381
00:42:14,736 --> 0:42:16,186
developer cared about every

1382
00:42:16,326 --> 0:42:17,416
aspect of this experience,

1383
00:42:18,316 --> 0:42:20,076
because the number of colors

1384
00:42:20,226 --> 0:42:21,036
feel endless.

1385
00:42:21,676 --> 0:42:22,786
And the interaction from

1386
00:42:22,786 --> 0:42:24,516
changing the hue, brightness and

1387
00:42:24,516 --> 0:42:26,286
saturation provides immediate

1388
00:42:26,286 --> 0:42:26,596
feedback.

1389
00:42:27,766 --> 0:42:29,216
To create this experience, the

1390
00:42:29,216 --> 0:42:30,986
developer spent countless hours

1391
00:42:31,056 --> 0:42:31,886
prototyping.

1392
00:42:32,406 --> 0:42:33,446
Now here's an example of a

1393
00:42:33,446 --> 0:42:35,286
prototype that was designed to

1394
00:42:35,316 --> 0:42:36,336
check the interaction

1395
00:42:36,336 --> 0:42:37,506
fundamentals first.

1396
00:42:38,486 --> 0:42:40,076
They used pure text buttons so

1397
00:42:40,076 --> 0:42:41,106
they wouldn't get distracted by

1398
00:42:41,106 --> 0:42:42,336
high-fidelity designs.

1399
00:42:42,866 --> 0:42:44,876
That way they could focus on the

1400
00:42:44,876 --> 0:42:46,646
detail of perfecting each

1401
00:42:46,646 --> 0:42:48,436
interaction of the tool editor.

1402
00:42:49,486 --> 0:42:51,676
Only after the interactions felt

1403
00:42:51,716 --> 0:42:53,496
good did the developers at Flow

1404
00:42:53,496 --> 0:42:55,036
move on to visual design.

1405
00:42:55,586 --> 0:42:58,446
Then they iterated to perfect

1406
00:42:58,536 --> 0:43:00,036
the details of each individual

1407
00:42:58,536 --> 0:43:00,036
the details of each individual

1408
00:43:00,036 --> 0:43:01,386
tool over time.

1409
00:43:02,176 --> 0:43:04,006
And they simplified how unique

1410
00:43:04,076 --> 0:43:05,286
properties of the tool were

1411
00:43:05,286 --> 0:43:07,396
displayed from the nibs, colors

1412
00:43:07,456 --> 0:43:08,076
and labels.

1413
00:43:09,146 --> 0:43:10,526
And finally, I just want to call

1414
00:43:10,526 --> 0:43:12,146
out how animation brings this

1415
00:43:12,146 --> 0:43:13,756
entire experience together.

1416
00:43:14,576 --> 0:43:16,276
In the real world, things

1417
00:43:16,276 --> 0:43:17,866
transition smoothly from one

1418
00:43:17,946 --> 0:43:18,946
state to another.

1419
00:43:19,506 --> 0:43:21,326
And it's reflected beautifully

1420
00:43:21,326 --> 0:43:22,466
in the Tool Editor here.

1421
00:43:23,466 --> 0:43:25,506
Animation is so much more than a

1422
00:43:25,506 --> 0:43:26,986
series of screens connected by

1423
00:43:26,986 --> 0:43:27,696
transitions.

1424
00:43:28,436 --> 0:43:30,396
Really good animation reminds

1425
00:43:30,466 --> 0:43:32,376
people how to use your UI.

1426
00:43:32,756 --> 0:43:34,396
And it provides feedback and

1427
00:43:34,396 --> 0:43:35,606
also draws your attention

1428
00:43:35,606 --> 0:43:36,296
onscreen.

1429
00:43:37,776 --> 0:43:38,906
But that's not all.

1430
00:43:39,516 --> 0:43:42,856
There are over 1,400 unique

1431
00:43:42,856 --> 0:43:43,906
color names in this app.

1432
00:43:44,586 --> 0:43:45,786
And when I asked the developer

1433
00:43:45,786 --> 0:43:49,676
how long it took, they said, "A

1434
00:43:49,676 --> 0:43:49,976
while."

1435
00:43:52,166 --> 0:43:53,786
In addition to collecting and

1436
00:43:53,786 --> 0:43:55,496
sourcing these color names, the

1437
00:43:55,496 --> 0:43:57,306
developer sweated the details to

1438
00:43:57,306 --> 0:44:00,546
determine what the rules were

1439
00:43:57,306 --> 0:44:00,546
determine what the rules were

1440
00:44:00,546 --> 0:44:02,496
for each color and how it mapped

1441
00:44:02,826 --> 0:44:04,156
to each color value.

1442
00:44:05,486 --> 0:44:06,856
The tool palette with an

1443
00:44:06,856 --> 0:44:08,446
expansive color selection

1444
00:44:08,526 --> 0:44:10,456
enables creative expression.

1445
00:44:10,456 --> 0:44:12,386
And that stays true to the app's

1446
00:44:12,666 --> 0:44:14,866
goal of helping you stay in a

1447
00:44:14,866 --> 0:44:15,866
creative mindset.

1448
00:44:17,146 --> 0:44:19,156
The developer absolutely nailed

1449
00:44:19,236 --> 0:44:21,876
the purpose, expanse and joy of

1450
00:44:21,876 --> 0:44:23,756
this experience all through the

1451
00:44:23,756 --> 0:44:25,566
details that come together.

1452
00:44:27,136 --> 0:44:28,696
Now attention to detail helps

1453
00:44:28,836 --> 0:44:30,986
your app or game stand out.

1454
00:44:32,136 --> 0:44:34,016
It's all about taking the time

1455
00:44:34,256 --> 0:44:35,666
and being comfortable staying in

1456
00:44:35,666 --> 0:44:37,136
the process of designing.

1457
00:44:38,066 --> 0:44:39,176
And you don't want to settle for

1458
00:44:39,176 --> 0:44:40,786
your first idea or your first

1459
00:44:40,786 --> 0:44:41,276
design.

1460
00:44:42,556 --> 0:44:43,836
It's about being methodical.

1461
00:44:44,386 --> 0:44:45,716
Solve the really big problems

1462
00:44:45,786 --> 0:44:47,396
first, just like Flow did with

1463
00:44:47,396 --> 0:44:48,996
interaction in that prototype we

1464
00:44:49,056 --> 0:44:50,866
saw, before you move on to

1465
00:44:50,866 --> 0:44:52,166
adding further detail like

1466
00:44:52,166 --> 0:44:53,856
visual design animation.

1467
00:44:54,416 --> 0:44:56,976
And I love this statement from a

1468
00:44:56,976 --> 0:44:58,096
really good friend of mine.

1469
00:44:58,556 --> 0:45:00,696
At the end of the day, when

1470
00:44:58,556 --> 0:45:00,696
At the end of the day, when

1471
00:45:00,696 --> 0:45:02,286
someone experiences your app or

1472
00:45:02,286 --> 0:45:04,196
game, they should be able to see

1473
00:45:04,196 --> 0:45:04,976
the developer's sweat.

1474
00:45:08,116 --> 0:45:09,786
&gt;&gt; That is kind of gross.

1475
00:45:09,786 --> 0:45:10,806
&gt;&gt; Oh come on, it's not that

1476
00:45:10,806 --> 0:45:10,976
gross.

1477
00:45:10,976 --> 0:45:11,816
&gt;&gt; But I think I know what you

1478
00:45:11,816 --> 0:45:12,226
mean.

1479
00:45:13,046 --> 0:45:14,706
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think what they mean

1480
00:45:14,706 --> 0:45:16,316
is it shows that the developer

1481
00:45:16,316 --> 0:45:19,136
totally cared about every aspect

1482
00:45:19,136 --> 0:45:21,166
of the experience down to the

1483
00:45:21,166 --> 0:45:23,816
very last pixel.

1484
00:45:24,186 --> 0:45:25,976
&gt;&gt; So we talked about immersion,

1485
00:45:26,136 --> 0:45:28,516
trust -- sorry -- innovation,

1486
00:45:28,516 --> 0:45:30,556
trust, refinement, aesthetics,

1487
00:45:30,696 --> 0:45:32,176
inclusion and attention to

1488
00:45:32,176 --> 0:45:34,626
detail with a single example

1489
00:45:35,216 --> 0:45:36,946
with each award-winning app and

1490
00:45:37,506 --> 0:45:37,596
game.

1491
00:45:38,516 --> 0:45:40,236
&gt;&gt; But all of these apps and

1492
00:45:40,236 --> 0:45:42,506
games embody these qualities of

1493
00:45:42,506 --> 0:45:43,286
great design.

1494
00:45:44,026 --> 0:45:45,996
&gt;&gt; These developers sweated the

1495
00:45:45,996 --> 0:45:48,466
details and created memorable

1496
00:45:48,466 --> 0:45:49,356
experiences.

1497
00:45:49,876 --> 0:45:51,606
&gt;&gt; Those experiences are totally

1498
00:45:51,606 --> 0:45:52,876
immersive and fun.

1499
00:45:53,716 --> 0:45:56,436
&gt;&gt; And everyone, by taking risks

1500
00:45:56,436 --> 0:45:57,866
and staying true to a vision,

1501
00:45:58,456 --> 0:46:00,266
they provided access to things

1502
00:45:58,456 --> 0:46:00,266
they provided access to things

1503
00:46:00,266 --> 0:46:02,146
that people didn't have before.

1504
00:46:02,866 --> 0:46:04,096
&gt;&gt; And all of these apps and

1505
00:46:04,096 --> 0:46:05,896
games are original.

1506
00:46:06,406 --> 0:46:07,956
There's no copy and paste in the

1507
00:46:07,956 --> 0:46:10,536
world of great design.

1508
00:46:10,686 --> 0:46:11,856
&gt;&gt; These innovations extended

1509
00:46:11,856 --> 0:46:13,296
the reach of care to millions of

1510
00:46:13,296 --> 0:46:14,506
people around the world.

1511
00:46:15,226 --> 0:46:16,726
So we want to thank the

1512
00:46:16,726 --> 0:46:17,926
developers who shared their

1513
00:46:17,926 --> 0:46:18,956
stories with us.

1514
00:46:19,376 --> 0:46:20,636
&gt;&gt; It was an honor to get a peek

1515
00:46:20,636 --> 0:46:21,896
behind the curtain at how you

1516
00:46:21,896 --> 0:46:23,126
designed your award-winning apps

1517
00:46:23,296 --> 0:46:23,856
and games.

1518
00:46:25,006 --> 0:46:25,956
&gt;&gt; [Together] Thank you so much

1519
00:46:25,956 --> 0:46:27,536
and have a great WWDC.

[ Applause ]

1521
00:46:30,466 --> 0:46:30,676
&gt;&gt; All right.
