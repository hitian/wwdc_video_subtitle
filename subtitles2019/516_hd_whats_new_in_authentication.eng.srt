3
00:00:15,666 --> 0:00:16,796
&gt;&gt; Hello, everyone.

4
00:00:17,466 --> 0:00:20,176
My name is Ricky Mondello, and I

5
00:00:20,246 --> 0:00:22,016
am so excited to be here to

6
00:00:22,016 --> 0:00:24,126
today to tell you about What's

7
00:00:24,126 --> 0:00:25,926
New in Authentication on Apple

8
00:00:25,926 --> 0:00:28,626
platforms, including some very

9
00:00:28,626 --> 0:00:30,856
exciting and new APIs in the

10
00:00:30,856 --> 0:00:32,156
Authentication Services

11
00:00:32,156 --> 0:00:32,606
framework.

12
00:00:33,596 --> 0:00:36,136
My goal is to help you get your

13
00:00:36,136 --> 0:00:38,526
users signed into your apps as

14
00:00:38,526 --> 0:00:40,706
quickly and securely as

15
00:00:40,706 --> 0:00:41,196
possible.

16
00:00:44,736 --> 0:00:47,086
We're going to talk about five

17
00:00:47,126 --> 0:00:50,426
topics today starting with Sign

18
00:00:50,426 --> 0:00:52,000
In with Apple.

19
00:00:54,606 --> 0:00:56,736
Sign In with Apple is an easy

20
00:00:56,736 --> 0:00:59,146
and secure way for users to sign

21
00:00:59,146 --> 0:00:59,936
into your apps.

22
00:01:00,936 --> 0:01:03,926
Signing in is as quick as a few

23
00:01:03,926 --> 0:01:10,616
taps and a face ID check.

24
00:01:10,836 --> 0:01:12,736
Sign In with Apple is a private

25
00:01:12,736 --> 0:01:14,626
alternative to other single

26
00:01:14,626 --> 0:01:16,466
sign-on providers that you might

27
00:01:16,466 --> 0:01:16,986
be aware of.

28
00:01:18,326 --> 0:01:19,746
And you probably already get the

29
00:01:19,746 --> 0:01:21,266
gist of what this capability is

30
00:01:21,266 --> 0:01:21,776
about.

31
00:01:22,276 --> 0:01:23,716
But what I want to do is

32
00:01:23,716 --> 0:01:25,616
emphasize a few key points

33
00:01:25,616 --> 0:01:27,656
related to how Authentication

34
00:01:27,656 --> 0:01:29,136
works already in your apps.

35
00:01:30,366 --> 0:01:32,396
And the first is that for your

36
00:01:32,396 --> 0:01:35,196
users, Sign In with Apple is

37
00:01:35,196 --> 0:01:36,776
easier to use than passwords.

38
00:01:37,986 --> 0:01:40,356
People generally don't love

39
00:01:40,606 --> 0:01:41,626
managing passwords.

40
00:01:42,516 --> 0:01:44,166
And when users don't have a

41
00:01:44,166 --> 0:01:46,386
password, that password can't be

42
00:01:46,386 --> 0:01:48,286
a bad password, and it can't get

43
00:01:48,286 --> 0:01:50,136
phished, which is good for your

44
00:01:50,136 --> 0:01:52,136
users, but it's also good for

45
00:01:52,136 --> 0:01:52,446
you.

46
00:01:53,786 --> 0:01:56,306
And for you specifically, these

47
00:01:56,306 --> 0:01:58,526
accounts are great accounts.

48
00:01:59,276 --> 0:02:00,776
Every single one of the accounts

49
00:01:59,276 --> 0:02:00,776
Every single one of the accounts

50
00:02:00,776 --> 0:02:01,926
that can be used with Sign In

51
00:02:01,926 --> 0:02:04,616
with Apple has strong two-factor

52
00:02:04,616 --> 0:02:06,466
authentication that's already

53
00:02:06,466 --> 0:02:08,126
used to protect their Apple ID.

54
00:02:09,006 --> 0:02:10,696
This two-factor authentication

55
00:02:10,925 --> 0:02:12,286
involves the user's circle of

56
00:02:12,286 --> 0:02:14,186
trusted devices and strong

57
00:02:14,186 --> 0:02:14,946
biometrics.

58
00:02:16,026 --> 0:02:17,796
Having a user start off with

59
00:02:17,796 --> 0:02:19,706
this much security is a lot

60
00:02:19,706 --> 0:02:21,266
easier than trying to bolt it on

61
00:02:21,266 --> 0:02:22,496
after the fact to a

62
00:02:22,496 --> 0:02:23,516
password-based account.

63
00:02:24,026 --> 0:02:26,336
And to help you with fraud,

64
00:02:26,666 --> 0:02:28,126
there's information included in

65
00:02:28,126 --> 0:02:31,596
the API about how Apple is

66
00:02:31,596 --> 0:02:32,836
confident about the account

67
00:02:32,836 --> 0:02:34,416
being from a real user, which

68
00:02:34,416 --> 0:02:34,986
you're going to really

69
00:02:34,986 --> 0:02:36,106
appreciate.

70
00:02:36,726 --> 0:02:38,286
And the third point that I want

71
00:02:38,286 --> 0:02:39,696
to emphasize about Sign In with

72
00:02:39,696 --> 0:02:42,636
Apple is that it is across

73
00:02:42,836 --> 0:02:45,976
platform experience, across all

74
00:02:45,976 --> 0:02:47,126
of the user's devices.

75
00:02:47,476 --> 0:02:48,456
If they're signed into their

76
00:02:48,456 --> 0:02:50,966
Apple ID, signing into your app

77
00:02:51,206 --> 0:02:53,466
is as easy as a quick face ID or

78
00:02:53,466 --> 0:02:54,266
touch ID check.

79
00:02:54,746 --> 0:02:56,996
And thanks to the web and web

80
00:02:56,996 --> 0:02:59,036
technologies, Sign In with Apple

81
00:02:59,036 --> 0:02:59,926
is available elsewhere.

82
00:03:01,956 --> 0:03:03,016
And don't worry.

83
00:03:03,756 --> 0:03:05,246
We're going to help your users

84
00:03:05,246 --> 0:03:07,776
not create a second account for

85
00:03:07,776 --> 0:03:09,646
your app if the user already has

86
00:03:09,646 --> 0:03:10,516
one that works for them.

87
00:03:11,736 --> 0:03:13,636
On app launch, your app can

88
00:03:13,636 --> 0:03:15,316
check for an existing

89
00:03:15,316 --> 0:03:17,036
password-based account saved to

90
00:03:17,036 --> 0:03:19,396
the iCloud Keychain even before

91
00:03:19,396 --> 0:03:20,656
you show your standard login

92
00:03:20,656 --> 0:03:22,636
interface so that users do the

93
00:03:22,636 --> 0:03:24,000
right thing.

94
00:03:26,296 --> 0:03:28,136
If you have a service with user

95
00:03:28,136 --> 0:03:30,576
accounts, you and your users can

96
00:03:30,576 --> 0:03:32,086
benefit from Sign In with Apple.

97
00:03:33,266 --> 0:03:34,196
To learn more about it,

98
00:03:34,616 --> 0:03:36,276
including how to adopt it on the

99
00:03:36,276 --> 0:03:39,216
web, watchOS, tvOS, the Mac,

100
00:03:40,326 --> 0:03:43,826
iPadOS, and iOS, check out

in the WWDC app.

103
00:03:52,156 --> 0:03:55,006
And that's Sign In with Apple, a

104
00:03:55,006 --> 0:03:56,646
convenient and private

105
00:03:56,646 --> 0:03:58,876
alternative to password-based

106
00:03:58,876 --> 0:03:59,556
authentication.

107
00:04:00,836 --> 0:04:01,576
And password-based

108
00:04:01,576 --> 0:04:03,516
authentication is actually my

109
00:04:03,516 --> 0:04:06,116
next topic because even in a

110
00:04:06,116 --> 0:04:08,386
world with a great, private

111
00:04:08,386 --> 0:04:10,816
single sign-on option, passwords

112
00:04:10,816 --> 0:04:11,856
are still going to be a part of

113
00:04:11,856 --> 0:04:12,196
our lives.

114
00:04:13,296 --> 0:04:15,256
And that's why iPhone has

115
00:04:15,346 --> 0:04:17,926
Password AutoFill, which makes

116
00:04:17,926 --> 0:04:19,946
it quick and easy for users to

117
00:04:19,946 --> 0:04:22,406
sign in to your apps on the

118
00:04:22,406 --> 0:04:23,916
existing login screens that you

119
00:04:23,916 --> 0:04:24,486
already have.

120
00:04:25,946 --> 0:04:28,166
Today, I am very excited to tell

121
00:04:28,166 --> 0:04:29,976
you that Password AutoFill is

122
00:04:29,976 --> 0:04:32,106
available for iPad apps for Mac

123
00:04:32,506 --> 0:04:33,926
with an interface that is

124
00:04:33,926 --> 0:04:36,076
specifically tailored to the

125
00:04:37,366 --> 0:04:37,476
Mac.

126
00:04:37,686 --> 0:04:39,346
Thanks. For users to get this

127
00:04:39,346 --> 0:04:40,706
deluxe experience that you see

128
00:04:40,706 --> 0:04:42,496
right here, where the exact

129
00:04:42,496 --> 0:04:43,886
right credential that the user

130
00:04:43,886 --> 0:04:45,116
wants to sign in with is in the

131
00:04:45,116 --> 0:04:47,146
list, there's just one thing

132
00:04:47,386 --> 0:04:48,956
that you have to do.

133
00:04:49,196 --> 0:04:50,286
Once you've brought your app to

134
00:04:50,286 --> 0:04:52,166
the Mac, it'll have a new app

135
00:04:52,166 --> 0:04:54,606
ID, and that app ID has to be

136
00:04:54,606 --> 0:04:56,416
listed on your server in order

137
00:04:56,416 --> 0:04:58,236
to tie your app and your website

138
00:04:58,236 --> 0:04:59,216
together.

139
00:05:00,936 --> 0:05:02,736
If you're using webcredentials

140
00:05:02,736 --> 0:05:04,716
to do this, your Apple app site

141
00:05:04,716 --> 0:05:06,556
association file might look

142
00:05:06,556 --> 0:05:07,346
something like this.

143
00:05:08,396 --> 0:05:10,016
And all you're going to do is

144
00:05:10,016 --> 0:05:11,826
add the app ID to this app's

145
00:05:11,826 --> 0:05:12,036
array.

146
00:05:12,946 --> 0:05:13,576
Super easy.

147
00:05:16,596 --> 0:05:18,346
But if you're using universal

148
00:05:18,346 --> 0:05:21,066
links, you'll add the new app ID

149
00:05:21,066 --> 0:05:24,526
here as part of the new app ID's

150
00:05:24,526 --> 0:05:26,126
key that can take a list.

151
00:05:27,106 --> 0:05:30,066
This key is new to iOS 13 and

152
00:05:30,066 --> 0:05:31,116
macOS Catalina.

153
00:05:32,756 --> 0:05:35,086
To maintain compatibility with

154
00:05:35,086 --> 0:05:37,926
iOS versions before 13, you'll

155
00:05:37,926 --> 0:05:40,086
want to keep this apps key with

156
00:05:40,086 --> 0:05:42,896
the value of an array and the

157
00:05:42,896 --> 0:05:44,636
app ID key that lists your

158
00:05:44,636 --> 0:05:45,886
existing iOS app.

159
00:05:46,836 --> 0:05:48,326
You really want to do this in

160
00:05:48,326 --> 0:05:50,066
order to ensure that universal

161
00:05:50,066 --> 0:05:51,356
links keep working for your

162
00:05:51,356 --> 0:05:53,276
users who are running iOS 12.

163
00:05:54,576 --> 0:05:56,306
There are a bunch of new

164
00:05:56,306 --> 0:05:57,756
features and universal links

165
00:05:57,756 --> 0:05:59,796
this year, including more

166
00:05:59,796 --> 0:06:01,276
powerful URL matching.

167
00:05:59,796 --> 0:06:01,276
powerful URL matching.

168
00:06:01,676 --> 0:06:03,776
And to learn more about those, I

169
00:06:03,776 --> 0:06:05,036
encourage you to check out the

170
00:06:05,036 --> 0:06:06,856
What's New in Universal Links

171
00:06:06,856 --> 0:06:09,946
video in the WWDC app.

172
00:06:14,636 --> 0:06:18,416
Whether on the Mac, iPad, Apple

173
00:06:18,416 --> 0:06:21,476
TV, or iPhone, Password AutoFill

174
00:06:21,666 --> 0:06:23,296
makes it easy for users to get

175
00:06:23,296 --> 0:06:24,946
signed in to apps on your

176
00:06:24,946 --> 0:06:26,116
existing login screens.

177
00:06:27,286 --> 0:06:30,176
But let's take a closer look at

178
00:06:30,176 --> 0:06:31,346
this screen right here.

179
00:06:32,246 --> 0:06:33,516
The user's current task of

180
00:06:33,516 --> 0:06:34,656
getting signed into your app?

181
00:06:35,336 --> 0:06:36,896
The answer to the problem is

182
00:06:36,896 --> 0:06:37,096
here.

183
00:06:37,746 --> 0:06:38,576
It's a small part of the

184
00:06:38,576 --> 0:06:39,026
keyboard.

185
00:06:39,026 --> 0:06:42,076
And this is great, because

186
00:06:42,076 --> 0:06:43,896
AutoFill is accommodating the

187
00:06:43,896 --> 0:06:45,996
username and password field

188
00:06:45,996 --> 0:06:47,876
combination pattern that we've

189
00:06:47,876 --> 0:06:50,036
seen for even before when iPhone

190
00:06:50,246 --> 0:06:50,736
existed.

191
00:06:52,046 --> 0:06:53,796
But your app can have an even

192
00:06:53,796 --> 0:06:55,786
more streamlined and intentional

193
00:06:55,786 --> 0:06:58,526
experience, and with iOS 13,

194
00:06:58,996 --> 0:07:00,646
it's easier to do this than ever

195
00:06:58,996 --> 0:07:00,646
it's easier to do this than ever

196
00:07:00,646 --> 0:07:01,106
before.

197
00:07:02,156 --> 0:07:03,956
The same sign-in experience I

context of Sign In with Apple,

200
00:07:07,646 --> 0:07:09,226
is available to all apps that

201
00:07:09,226 --> 0:07:10,186
use passwords.

00:07:10,596 --> 0:07:11,886
And it's available through the

00:07:13,086 --> 0:07:13,526
framework.

00:07:14,776 --> 0:07:16,916
The same API and functionality

206
00:07:17,466 --> 0:07:19,526
is also available on macOS

00:07:19,526 --> 0:07:20,016
Catalina.

[ Applause ]

209
00:07:29,676 --> 0:07:31,306
Let's talk about how to add this

210
00:07:31,306 --> 0:07:33,286
functionality to your apps.

211
00:07:34,336 --> 0:07:36,376
The first step is to write some

212
00:07:36,376 --> 0:07:37,586
code using the

213
00:07:37,586 --> 0:07:38,756
AuthenticationServices

214
00:07:38,756 --> 0:07:39,156
framework.

215
00:07:39,606 --> 0:07:41,786
You'll create an

216
00:07:41,786 --> 0:07:44,296
AuthorizationController using a

217
00:07:44,296 --> 0:07:45,406
password request.

218
00:07:46,416 --> 0:07:48,006
The AuthorizationController is

219
00:07:48,006 --> 0:07:49,486
the same object that you'll use

220
00:07:49,486 --> 0:07:50,526
for Sign In with Apple.

221
00:07:51,016 --> 0:07:52,466
But here we're just using a

222
00:07:52,466 --> 0:07:54,186
different kind of request.

223
00:07:55,456 --> 0:07:58,286
Then you'll set up a delegate as

224
00:07:58,286 --> 0:07:59,886
well as an object that will help

225
00:07:59,886 --> 0:08:01,366
coordinate presentation of the

226
00:07:59,886 --> 0:08:01,366
coordinate presentation of the

227
00:08:01,366 --> 0:08:01,976
interface.

228
00:08:02,526 --> 0:08:04,796
And then it'll tell the

229
00:08:04,796 --> 0:08:05,896
controller to perform the

230
00:08:06,576 --> 0:08:06,826
request.

231
00:08:08,296 --> 0:08:10,166
When the user has selected the

232
00:08:10,166 --> 0:08:11,516
account that they want to use,

233
00:08:12,586 --> 0:08:15,026
the API will call the delegate,

234
00:08:15,476 --> 0:08:16,986
and you can take it from there

235
00:08:16,986 --> 0:08:18,536
to complete the sign-in.

236
00:08:19,576 --> 0:08:21,716
If didCompleteWithError is

237
00:08:21,716 --> 0:08:23,626
immediately called for you, it

238
00:08:23,626 --> 0:08:24,846
might mean that your user

239
00:08:24,846 --> 0:08:26,406
doesn't have any passwords saved

240
00:08:26,406 --> 0:08:28,016
in their iCloud Keychain for

241
00:08:28,016 --> 0:08:28,926
your app and website.

242
00:08:28,926 --> 0:08:31,256
And then you should just

243
00:08:31,256 --> 0:08:32,446
fallback to showing your normal

244
00:08:32,446 --> 0:08:33,166
sign-in screen.

245
00:08:33,356 --> 0:08:34,395
The user can take it from there.

246
00:08:35,846 --> 0:08:37,106
But if you're sure that you have

247
00:08:37,106 --> 0:08:38,976
credentials on a test device and

248
00:08:38,976 --> 0:08:40,366
you're seeing the error handler

249
00:08:40,366 --> 0:08:42,196
get called, you're going to want

250
00:08:42,196 --> 0:08:43,275
to back to checking your

251
00:08:43,275 --> 0:08:44,326
associated domains.

252
00:08:45,506 --> 0:08:46,746
If you've never tied your app

253
00:08:46,746 --> 0:08:48,056
and website together before

254
00:08:48,056 --> 0:08:49,366
through associated domains,

video that's in the WWDC app.

265
00:09:07,776 --> 0:09:10,276
Something about this API that is

266
00:09:10,276 --> 0:09:12,586
really awesome is that you can

267
00:09:12,586 --> 0:09:14,076
request multiple types of

268
00:09:14,076 --> 0:09:16,036
accounts at the same time using

269
00:09:16,036 --> 0:09:17,256
the AuthorizationController.

270
00:09:18,346 --> 0:09:20,206
And this is super handy if you

271
00:09:20,206 --> 0:09:22,036
want to check for both a

If you do this, you're going to

want to make sure that you

277
00:09:30,196 --> 0:09:32,166
handle both types of credentials

278
00:09:32,796 --> 0:09:34,356
in the CompleteWithAuthorization

279
00:09:34,356 --> 0:09:35,646
delegate method.

280
00:09:37,506 --> 0:09:39,636
And that's how easy it is to use

281
00:09:39,636 --> 0:09:41,586
the new Authentication services

282
00:09:41,586 --> 0:09:44,286
APIs to make the process of

getting signed into your apps

284
00:09:46,066 --> 0:09:47,516
even more streamlined than

285
00:09:47,516 --> 0:09:48,846
password AutoFill was able to.

286
00:09:54,336 --> 0:09:56,686
As long as we have passwords,

287
00:09:57,956 --> 0:09:59,156
there needs to be a healthy way

288
00:09:59,156 --> 0:10:01,806
to use them, a safe way to use

289
00:09:59,156 --> 0:10:01,806
to use them, a safe way to use

00:10:01,806 --> 0:10:01,976
them.

291
00:10:02,906 --> 0:10:04,726
And that's why iPhone has

292
00:10:04,886 --> 0:10:06,746
Automatic Strong Passwords,

293
00:10:07,406 --> 0:10:09,466
which encourages users to use a

294
00:10:09,466 --> 0:10:11,806
strong, unique password for

295
00:10:11,806 --> 0:10:12,816
every single one of their

296
00:10:12,816 --> 0:10:15,056
accounts, which greatly improves

297
00:10:15,056 --> 0:10:17,436
their security while also being

298
00:10:17,436 --> 0:10:18,746
easier to do than making the

299
00:10:18,746 --> 0:10:20,316
mistake of trying to create a

300
00:10:20,316 --> 0:10:21,206
password by hand.

301
00:10:22,466 --> 0:10:23,746
But what if one of your users

302
00:10:23,856 --> 0:10:25,206
already has a password that's

303
00:10:25,206 --> 0:10:25,716
kind of weak?

304
00:10:26,786 --> 0:10:30,096
Now, in Safari 13 and iOS 13,

305
00:10:30,796 --> 0:10:32,796
when a user signs into a website

306
00:10:33,136 --> 0:10:34,536
and Safari notices that the

307
00:10:34,536 --> 0:10:35,966
password they just used was

308
00:10:35,966 --> 0:10:38,536

00:10:38,536 --> 0:10:40,706
user to go and visit the website

310
00:10:40,766 --> 0:10:41,806
to change the password.

311
00:10:42,546 --> 0:10:43,726
And this is at the moment of

312
00:10:43,726 --> 0:10:45,246

313
00:10:45,246 --> 0:10:46,696
thinking about what the account

314
00:10:46,696 --> 0:10:47,266
means to them.

315
00:10:47,836 --> 0:10:50,346

sign-in even faster.

375
00:12:51,566 --> 0:12:54,836
Sometimes the user will already

376

do is agree to signing into your

394
00:13:31,936 --> 0:13:33,806
your users will have their

395
00:13:33,806 --> 0:13:35,696
browser's password manager or

396
00:13:35,696 --> 0:13:37,036
password manager extension

397
00:13:37,036 --> 0:13:38,476
available to them in order to

398
00:13:38,476 --> 0:13:40,266
help get them signed in.

399
00:13:42,416 --> 0:13:43,816
If you're using the

400
00:13:43,816 --> 0:13:46,156
AuthenticationSession API, it

401
00:13:46,156 --> 0:13:47,456
has a few new features for you

402
00:13:47,456 --> 0:13:48,216
to use this year.

403
00:13:48,326 --> 0:13:51,546
And the first is a more private

404
00:13:51,546 --> 0:13:53,136
kind of sign-in.

405
00:13:54,576 --> 0:13:55,296
Because the

406
00:13:55,296 --> 0:13:57,216
AuthenticationSession shares

407
00:13:57,216 --> 0:13:58,726
website data with Safari,

408
00:13:59,686 --> 0:14:01,586
ASWebAuthenticationSession

409
00:13:59,686 --> 0:14:01,586
ASWebAuthenticationSession

410
00:14:01,676 --> 0:14:03,686
enables a single sign-on

411
00:14:03,686 --> 0:14:04,366
experience.

412
00:14:05,496 --> 0:14:08,116
New to iOS 13, your app can

413
00:14:08,116 --> 0:14:10,436
choose to deliver a more private

414
00:14:10,436 --> 0:14:12,716
experience, an experience that

415
00:14:12,716 --> 0:14:14,896
won't leave users logged into

416
00:14:14,896 --> 0:14:16,446
the identity provider in their

417
00:14:16,446 --> 0:14:18,306
web browser after they've signed

418
00:14:18,306 --> 0:14:19,466
into your app.

419
00:14:20,456 --> 0:14:22,036
If your app asks for this

420
00:14:22,036 --> 0:14:24,546
experience, users won't see this

421
00:14:24,546 --> 0:14:25,026
dialog.

422
00:14:25,886 --> 0:14:27,726
Instead, they'll be taken

423
00:14:27,726 --> 0:14:28,966
directly to the identity

424
00:14:28,966 --> 0:14:30,826
provider in order to get signed

425
00:14:31,416 --> 0:14:31,496
in.

426
00:14:33,576 --> 0:14:35,266
To do this, set the

427
00:14:35,266 --> 0:14:36,616
prefersEphemeral

428
00:14:36,616 --> 0:14:38,836
WebBrowserSession property on

429
00:14:38,836 --> 0:14:40,626
the session to true before

430
00:14:40,626 --> 0:14:41,426
starting the session.

431
00:14:42,696 --> 0:14:44,376
By doing this, you give your

432
00:14:44,436 --> 0:14:47,396
users more privacy and avoid

433
00:14:47,396 --> 0:14:49,486
that confirmation dialog, which

434
00:14:49,486 --> 0:14:50,796
overall might be a better

435
00:14:50,796 --> 0:14:52,426
experience for your app.

436
00:14:54,296 --> 0:14:56,806
Next, supporting multiple

437
00:14:56,806 --> 0:14:57,266
windows.

438
00:14:58,706 --> 0:15:00,126
In iOS 12, the

439
00:14:58,706 --> 0:15:00,126
In iOS 12, the

440
00:15:00,126 --> 0:15:02,586
AuthenticationSession API didn't

441
00:15:02,586 --> 0:15:05,146
need any information about view

442
00:15:05,146 --> 0:15:07,186
or windows from you in order to

443
00:15:07,186 --> 0:15:08,236
display its interface.

444
00:15:09,236 --> 0:15:11,326
This is because the API was iOS

445
00:15:11,326 --> 0:15:14,186
only, and almost all apps drew

446
00:15:14,186 --> 0:15:15,236
into a single window.

447
00:15:16,186 --> 0:15:19,136
But now with iPadOS and macOS

448
00:15:19,136 --> 0:15:20,686
support, you're going to have to

449
00:15:20,686 --> 0:15:22,076
help us out a little bit to

450
00:15:22,076 --> 0:15:23,106
figure out where to draw the

451
00:15:23,106 --> 0:15:23,686
interface.

452
00:15:25,056 --> 0:15:28,726
First, you'll give the session a

453
00:15:28,726 --> 0:15:30,746
presentationContextProvider, and

454
00:15:31,496 --> 0:15:33,466
that presentationContextProvider

455
00:15:33,796 --> 0:15:35,606
will provide a window via the

456
00:15:35,606 --> 0:15:36,896
PresentationAnchor method.

457
00:15:37,786 --> 0:15:39,316
This is a really easy change and

458
00:15:39,316 --> 0:15:40,946
one that you're definitely going

459
00:15:40,946 --> 0:15:43,926
to want to make.

460
00:15:43,926 --> 0:15:45,026
One more thing about OAuth.

461
00:15:46,096 --> 0:15:48,576
ASWebAuthenticationSession has a

462
00:15:48,576 --> 0:15:50,936
deprecated predecessor called

463
00:15:51,006 --> 0:15:52,226
SFAuthenticationSession.

464
00:15:52,866 --> 0:15:54,116
It's from the Safari Services

465
00:15:54,116 --> 0:15:54,526
framework.

466
00:15:55,536 --> 0:15:57,046
If you haven't already, you're

467
00:15:57,046 --> 0:15:58,076
going to want to take a moment

468
00:15:58,076 --> 0:15:58,916
to switch over.

469
00:16:00,066 --> 0:16:02,216
ASWebAuthenticationSession has

470
00:16:02,216 --> 0:16:03,256
the new features that we just

471
00:16:03,256 --> 0:16:05,556
talked about, and it's available

472
00:16:05,556 --> 0:16:06,856
on the Mac.

473
00:16:06,856 --> 0:16:07,786
It's, basically, the

474
00:16:07,786 --> 0:16:09,636
non-deprecated drop-in

475
00:16:09,636 --> 0:16:11,026
replacement for the old API.

476
00:16:11,756 --> 0:16:15,936
And that's it for OAuth.

477
00:16:20,836 --> 0:16:23,776
This year, macOS supports USB

478
00:16:23,936 --> 0:16:26,906
security keys in Safari through

479
00:16:26,906 --> 0:16:28,336
the WebAuthentication standard.

480
00:16:29,156 --> 0:16:31,246
I am really happy about this

481
00:16:31,246 --> 0:16:33,056
support, especially because I

482
00:16:33,056 --> 0:16:34,096
know that a number of you have

483
00:16:34,096 --> 0:16:35,586
been asking for it.

484
00:16:36,736 --> 0:16:39,266
Depending on who or what you're

485
00:16:39,266 --> 0:16:41,126
protecting and the threat models

486
00:16:41,126 --> 0:16:42,986
that you're concerned about, you

487
00:16:42,986 --> 0:16:45,066
might consider tying user

488
00:16:45,066 --> 0:16:47,126
authentication to the physical

489
00:16:47,126 --> 0:16:48,046
presence of some kind of

490
00:16:48,046 --> 0:16:49,566
hardware device.

491
00:16:50,696 --> 0:16:54,346
Safari 13 supports USB-based

492
00:16:54,796 --> 0:16:57,246
FIDO2-compliant devices with the

493
00:16:57,246 --> 0:16:58,436
WebAuthentication standard.

494
00:16:59,566 --> 0:17:01,656
It's available as an

495
00:16:59,566 --> 0:17:01,656
It's available as an

496
00:17:02,426 --> 0:17:05,185
experimental feature in Seed 1

497
00:17:05,185 --> 0:17:07,626
of macOS Catalina, and it'll be

498
00:17:07,626 --> 0:17:09,236
on by default in Seed 2.

499
00:17:10,175 --> 0:17:11,786
You can also try it out right

500
00:17:11,786 --> 0:17:13,465
now if you download Safari

501
00:17:13,465 --> 0:17:14,356
Technology Preview.

502
00:17:14,955 --> 0:17:17,816
If you're interested in

503
00:17:17,816 --> 0:17:19,976
supporting USB security keys,

504
00:17:20,506 --> 0:17:22,445
it's really important to offer a

505
00:17:22,445 --> 0:17:24,236
great account recovery story,

506
00:17:25,435 --> 0:17:26,935
just in case your user's key

507
00:17:27,205 --> 0:17:29,816
gets lost, stolen, or broken.

508
00:17:31,276 --> 0:17:33,196
And designing account recovery

509
00:17:33,336 --> 0:17:35,316
systems when a hardware token is

510
00:17:35,316 --> 0:17:37,996
involved is really important,

511
00:17:37,996 --> 0:17:38,706
but it's not always

512
00:17:38,706 --> 0:17:39,336
straightforward.

513
00:17:40,486 --> 0:17:42,286
So unless you are already in

514
00:17:42,286 --> 0:17:44,246
this business or were seriously

515
00:17:44,246 --> 0:17:46,106
considering getting into it,

516
00:17:46,856 --> 0:17:48,546
it's more likely that one or

517
00:17:48,546 --> 0:17:50,076
more of the other areas that I

518
00:17:50,076 --> 0:17:51,816
cover today will be more

519
00:17:51,816 --> 0:17:53,956
relevant for your users, your

520
00:17:53,956 --> 0:17:54,976
apps, and your websites.

521
00:18:00,266 --> 0:18:01,866
If you develop an app with user

522
00:18:01,866 --> 0:18:04,386
accounts, I have three takeaways

523
00:18:04,426 --> 0:18:05,286
from what we've talked about

524
00:18:05,286 --> 0:18:05,506
today.

525
00:18:06,936 --> 0:18:09,326
First, strongly consider

526
00:18:09,326 --> 0:18:11,036
adopting Sign In with Apple.

527
00:18:12,196 --> 0:18:13,946
For your users, the best

528
00:18:13,946 --> 0:18:15,736
password is no password,

529
00:18:16,306 --> 0:18:17,896
especially when it's backed by

530
00:18:17,896 --> 0:18:19,666
two-factor authentication and

531
00:18:19,666 --> 0:18:21,000
great biometrics.

532
00:18:22,236 --> 0:18:25,126
Two, make signing into your app

533
00:18:25,476 --> 0:18:28,086
a one-tap experience using the

534
00:18:28,086 --> 0:18:29,676
Authentication Services

535
00:18:29,766 --> 0:18:30,286
framework.

536
00:18:31,056 --> 0:18:32,406
Users don't even need to see a

537
00:18:32,406 --> 0:18:34,266
keyboard anymore to get signed

538
00:18:34,706 --> 0:18:34,796
in.

539
00:18:35,476 --> 0:18:37,446
And finally, implement the

540
00:18:37,446 --> 0:18:39,036
well-known URL for changing

541
00:18:39,036 --> 0:18:39,686
passwords.

542
00:18:40,456 --> 0:18:42,076
It's really easy to do, takes

543
00:18:42,076 --> 0:18:44,056
just a moment, and it makes a

544
00:18:44,056 --> 0:18:46,146
huge difference when Safari is

545
00:18:46,146 --> 0:18:47,586
going to try to help your users

546
00:18:47,756 --> 0:18:48,906
upgrade their passwords.

547
00:18:51,076 --> 0:18:52,686
You'll find more information

548
00:18:52,686 --> 0:18:54,106
about what I covered today and

549
00:18:54,196 --> 0:18:57,136
more in the WWDC app or on the

550
00:18:57,136 --> 0:18:57,356
web.

551
00:18:58,406 --> 0:18:59,796
And that is it for me.

552
00:18:59,956 --> 0:19:01,066
Thank you all so much.

553
00:18:59,956 --> 0:19:01,066
Thank you all so much.

554
00:19:01,376 --> 0:19:02,556
I really hope you've been having

555
00:19:02,556 --> 0:19:04,186
a wonderful WWDC.
