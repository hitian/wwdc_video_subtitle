00:00:13,276 --> 0:00:15,346
&gt;&gt; Hello. I'm Hoyt, from the

4
00:00:15,346 --> 0:00:16,816
Turi team at Apple, and I'm here

5
00:00:16,816 --> 0:00:18,376
to tell you about the Create ML

6
00:00:18,506 --> 0:00:19,236
Recommender.

7
00:00:20,046 --> 0:00:21,486
Create ML Recommenders are a

8
00:00:21,486 --> 0:00:23,366
fantastic way to add

9
00:00:23,366 --> 0:00:25,556
personalization and intelligence

10
00:00:25,556 --> 0:00:27,416
into the user experience of your

11
00:00:27,416 --> 0:00:27,666
app.

12
00:00:28,896 --> 0:00:30,546
Suppose I have a hiking journal

13
00:00:31,016 --> 0:00:32,656
where I can log different hikes

14
00:00:32,656 --> 0:00:34,506
I've taken and how much I like

15
00:00:34,686 --> 0:00:35,886
or dislike each of them.

16
00:00:36,816 --> 0:00:38,656
Wouldn't it be great if this

17
00:00:38,806 --> 0:00:41,186
also recommended new trails for

18
00:00:41,186 --> 0:00:42,756
me to try based on the

19
00:00:42,756 --> 0:00:44,876
preferences I already expressed?

20
00:00:46,586 --> 0:00:48,756
Or suppose I have a math quiz

21
00:00:48,756 --> 0:00:51,946
app, where the user has to solve

22
00:00:51,946 --> 0:00:53,446
a number of math problems in a

23
00:00:53,446 --> 0:00:54,366
timed session.

24
00:00:55,226 --> 0:00:56,706
It would make sense here to

25
00:00:56,706 --> 0:00:58,396
choose the next problem to ask

26
00:00:58,826 --> 0:01:00,256
based on which of the previously

27
00:00:58,826 --> 0:01:00,256
based on which of the previously

28
00:01:00,256 --> 0:01:02,016
problems the user got correct or

29
00:01:02,016 --> 0:01:02,426
incorrect.

30
00:01:03,606 --> 0:01:05,495
Or let's take a look at a

31
00:01:05,566 --> 0:01:07,216
shopping list where I can list

32
00:01:07,216 --> 0:01:08,316
out the ingredients I need to

33
00:01:08,316 --> 0:01:09,656
buy the next time I go to the

34
00:01:09,656 --> 0:01:10,386
grocery store.

35
00:01:11,356 --> 0:01:13,586
Now, this is really simple here.

36
00:01:14,136 --> 0:01:16,546
But if it suggested ingredients

37
00:01:16,546 --> 0:01:18,156
that I may have forgotten, it

38
00:01:18,156 --> 0:01:19,906
makes the experience more

39
00:01:19,906 --> 0:01:21,296
engaging and interesting.

40
00:01:23,026 --> 0:01:25,286
My goal today is to enable you

41
00:01:25,286 --> 0:01:26,916
to create these kind of user

42
00:01:26,916 --> 0:01:28,966
experiences in your app through

43
00:01:28,966 --> 0:01:30,536
the Create ML recommender.

44
00:01:31,926 --> 0:01:33,276
Let's dive into how we're going

45
00:01:33,276 --> 0:01:35,466
to do this and let's start with

46
00:01:35,466 --> 0:01:35,926
the data.

47
00:01:38,456 --> 0:01:40,906
Recommenders work by looking for

48
00:01:40,906 --> 0:01:43,236
patterns in groups of items.

49
00:01:44,026 --> 0:01:45,206
Back to the shopping list.

50
00:01:45,206 --> 0:01:46,996
When I'm going to the grocery

51
00:01:46,996 --> 0:01:49,556
store, it's likely I have a few

52
00:01:49,556 --> 0:01:50,576
recipes in mind.

53
00:01:50,896 --> 0:01:52,016
I want to buy the ingredients

54
00:01:52,016 --> 0:01:53,006
for them and make something

55
00:01:53,006 --> 0:01:53,616
delicious.

56
00:01:53,906 --> 0:01:56,406
And, well what are recipes?

57
00:01:56,776 --> 0:01:58,756
They are groups of ingredients.

58
00:01:59,096 --> 0:02:00,776
And it turns out this is a

59
00:01:59,096 --> 0:02:00,776
And it turns out this is a

60
00:02:00,776 --> 0:02:03,346
perfect example of the kind of

61
00:02:03,346 --> 0:02:04,976
data you can use for

62
00:02:04,976 --> 0:02:05,646
Recommender.

63
00:02:06,506 --> 0:02:08,645
In fact, all you need to do here

64
00:02:09,066 --> 0:02:11,036
is to take these recipes and

65
00:02:11,036 --> 0:02:13,636
turn them into a table with a

66
00:02:13,636 --> 0:02:16,826
group column and an item column.

67
00:02:17,566 --> 0:02:19,456
Each row here says that a

68
00:02:19,456 --> 0:02:21,006
particular item belongs to a

69
00:02:21,006 --> 0:02:21,976
particular group.

70
00:02:23,106 --> 0:02:25,616
Now, here the groups are recipes

71
00:02:25,616 --> 0:02:27,146
and the items are ingredients.

72
00:02:27,506 --> 0:02:28,566
But this can be much more

73
00:02:28,566 --> 0:02:29,006
general.

74
00:02:29,556 --> 0:02:31,316
Let's go to the math quiz app.

75
00:02:31,846 --> 0:02:33,406
Here, the group can be the

76
00:02:33,406 --> 0:02:35,026
particular session that a

77
00:02:35,026 --> 0:02:36,736
problem was asked in.

78
00:02:36,806 --> 0:02:38,026
The item is the problem.

79
00:02:38,256 --> 0:02:40,926
And, well, I need to introduce

80
00:02:40,926 --> 0:02:41,966
one more concept here.

81
00:02:42,616 --> 0:02:43,896
We need to be able to give the

82
00:02:43,896 --> 0:02:44,966
model feedback.

83
00:02:45,486 --> 0:02:46,706
We need to tell it which

84
00:02:46,746 --> 0:02:48,856
problems the user got correct or

85
00:02:48,856 --> 0:02:49,516
incorrect.

86
00:02:49,936 --> 0:02:51,986
And so the Recommender also

87
00:02:51,986 --> 0:02:53,646
works with a rating column.

88
00:02:54,436 --> 0:02:56,136
A rating is a measure of how

89
00:02:56,136 --> 0:02:57,666
good or how desirable a

90
00:02:57,666 --> 0:02:59,126
particular interaction is.

91
00:02:59,666 --> 0:03:01,976
Here, we could assign a 1 if the

92
00:02:59,666 --> 0:03:01,976
Here, we could assign a 1 if the

93
00:03:01,976 --> 0:03:03,946
user got the problem correct, or

94
00:03:03,946 --> 0:03:05,166
a 0 if they got it wrong.

95
00:03:06,656 --> 0:03:09,356
Now, with the hiking app, the

96
00:03:09,866 --> 0:03:13,396
data there has the user, has the

97
00:03:13,396 --> 0:03:15,826
group being the user, the trail

98
00:03:16,076 --> 0:03:17,846
being the item, and a rating

99
00:03:17,846 --> 0:03:19,926
being an explicit feedback from

100
00:03:19,926 --> 0:03:21,166
the user about how much they

101
00:03:21,166 --> 0:03:22,976
liked or disliked that

102
00:03:22,976 --> 0:03:24,496
particular trail.

103
00:03:27,106 --> 0:03:29,746
Now, in your app, you would

104
00:03:29,746 --> 0:03:31,276
query it with the same kind of

105
00:03:31,276 --> 0:03:31,706
data.

106
00:03:32,286 --> 0:03:33,616
You would locally track these

107
00:03:33,616 --> 0:03:35,486
interactions and you would feed

108
00:03:35,486 --> 0:03:38,946
in a set of items or item rating

109
00:03:38,946 --> 0:03:40,366
pairs to your model.

110
00:03:40,846 --> 0:03:42,786
Your model would then recommend

111
00:03:43,036 --> 0:03:44,856
new items based on the

112
00:03:44,856 --> 0:03:46,696
preferences and patterns

113
00:03:46,696 --> 0:03:49,046
expressed in your input data.

114
00:03:50,196 --> 0:03:51,536
Let's see this particular one in

115
00:03:51,536 --> 0:03:51,976
action.

116
00:03:52,806 --> 0:03:55,156
So, I have here a simple hiking

117
00:03:55,156 --> 0:03:55,526
journal.

118
00:03:56,276 --> 0:03:57,886
I don't have any hikes logged

119
00:03:57,886 --> 0:03:59,696
yet and so it's actually

120
00:03:59,696 --> 0:04:01,526
recommending popular items,

121
00:03:59,696 --> 0:04:01,526
recommending popular items,

122
00:04:01,526 --> 0:04:02,996
things that get consistently

123
00:04:02,996 --> 0:04:03,646
high ratings.

124
00:04:04,226 --> 0:04:05,246
Let's go see if there's any

125
00:04:05,246 --> 0:04:06,266
interesting ones in here.

126
00:04:07,016 --> 0:04:09,366
Well, I'm adventurous, let's try

127
00:04:09,366 --> 0:04:09,786
this one.

128
00:04:10,136 --> 0:04:10,866
Well, okay.

129
00:04:11,196 --> 0:04:13,166
Actually too hot, too dry.

130
00:04:13,166 --> 0:04:14,446
Didn't really like it.

131
00:04:14,446 --> 0:04:17,055
So, I'm going to say it's not

132
00:04:17,086 --> 0:04:17,446
for me.

133
00:04:18,296 --> 0:04:21,046
Now, what we see here is that

134
00:04:21,046 --> 0:04:23,326
this hiking journal has now

135
00:04:23,326 --> 0:04:25,996
updated the hikes based on the

136
00:04:25,996 --> 0:04:27,536
preferences I've expressed

137
00:04:27,936 --> 0:04:28,666
already.

138
00:04:30,146 --> 0:04:31,576
It's recommending different

139
00:04:31,576 --> 0:04:32,176
landscapes.

140
00:04:32,176 --> 0:04:33,786
Ah. This one looks really nice.

141
00:04:34,026 --> 0:04:35,206
I grew up in Colorado.

142
00:04:35,346 --> 0:04:36,816
I love aspens, I love tall

143
00:04:36,816 --> 0:04:37,306
mountains.

144
00:04:37,306 --> 0:04:37,926
Let's try it.

145
00:04:37,926 --> 0:04:39,796
Okay. It was fantastic.

146
00:04:40,736 --> 0:04:43,916
Loved it. And here the model is

147
00:04:43,916 --> 0:04:44,966
learning more about my

148
00:04:44,966 --> 0:04:45,926
preferences now.

149
00:04:46,236 --> 0:04:47,466
It knows I like mountains,

150
00:04:47,746 --> 0:04:49,806
rocks, and colorful foliage.

151
00:04:50,596 --> 0:04:52,406
So, let's try another one.

152
00:04:53,346 --> 0:04:53,906
All right.

153
00:04:54,606 --> 0:04:55,116
There we go.

154
00:04:57,356 --> 0:04:59,506
Now I'm exhausted.

155
00:04:59,896 --> 0:05:00,886
Three hikes in one day.

156
00:04:59,896 --> 0:05:00,886
Three hikes in one day.

157
00:05:01,066 --> 0:05:01,856
That's quite a bit [laughter].

158
00:05:03,356 --> 0:05:05,446
Let's go back to the slides

159
00:05:05,446 --> 0:05:05,676
here.

160

[ Applause ]

161
00:05:12,276 --> 0:05:13,786
Now, I already showed you an

162
00:05:13,786 --> 0:05:15,716
example of the type of data used

163
00:05:15,946 --> 0:05:17,676
to train this particular model.

164
00:05:18,896 --> 0:05:21,216
Now I would like to dive into

165
00:05:21,216 --> 0:05:23,536
how the Create ML Recommender

166
00:05:23,916 --> 0:05:25,666
extracts the patterns from this

167
00:05:25,696 --> 0:05:28,526
data and builds a model that you

168
00:05:28,526 --> 0:05:30,326
can use in your app.

169
00:05:30,616 --> 0:05:32,496
The Create ML Recommender works

170
00:05:32,536 --> 0:05:34,086
by learning relationships

171
00:05:34,406 --> 0:05:35,926
between the items.

172
00:05:36,586 --> 0:05:38,356
What items tend to go with what

173
00:05:38,356 --> 0:05:39,056
other items?

174
00:05:39,746 --> 0:05:41,236
Let's suppose we have three

175
00:05:41,236 --> 0:05:41,806
hikes here.

176
00:05:41,806 --> 0:05:44,186
Two of these are up tall, steep,

177
00:05:44,186 --> 0:05:46,066
mountain peaks, possibly the

178
00:05:46,066 --> 0:05:46,856
kind I would like.

179
00:05:47,536 --> 0:05:49,526
And one of these is a nice

180
00:05:49,526 --> 0:05:51,346
stroll by a sandy beach.

181
00:05:52,586 --> 0:05:54,676
Now, that information is not

182
00:05:54,676 --> 0:05:56,216
actually present in the model.

183
00:05:56,216 --> 0:05:58,786
All we have are hikers, trails,

184
00:05:58,786 --> 0:05:59,666
and ratings.

185
00:06:00,516 --> 0:06:02,576
However, if you like climbing

186
00:06:02,576 --> 0:06:04,576
these tall mountain peaks, it's

187
00:06:04,576 --> 0:06:05,676
likely you would give both of

188
00:06:05,676 --> 0:06:06,926
these similar ratings.

189
00:06:06,926 --> 0:06:08,216
And so what we would see in the

190
00:06:08,216 --> 0:06:10,106
data is that the same hiker

191
00:06:10,106 --> 0:06:11,576
would give each of these hikes

192
00:06:11,716 --> 0:06:12,756
similar ratings.

193
00:06:13,506 --> 0:06:16,016
Likewise, because you go out and

194
00:06:16,016 --> 0:06:17,376
enjoy a nice stroll by the

195
00:06:17,376 --> 0:06:18,716
beach, it doesn't necessarily

196
00:06:18,716 --> 0:06:20,116
mean you want to climb a tall,

197
00:06:20,116 --> 0:06:21,236
cold, windy mountain.

198
00:06:21,626 --> 0:06:23,226
And, or vice versa.

199
00:06:23,556 --> 0:06:25,746
And so you may give these two

200
00:06:25,746 --> 0:06:27,346
trails different ratings.

201
00:06:28,646 --> 0:06:30,756
The Create ML Recommender would

202
00:06:30,756 --> 0:06:32,476
find these patterns in the data

203
00:06:32,956 --> 0:06:34,946
and learn that these first two

204
00:06:34,946 --> 0:06:36,406
hikes are similar to each other.

205
00:06:36,576 --> 0:06:37,646
They tend to go together.

206
00:06:38,076 --> 0:06:39,706
And the third one is different.

207
00:06:40,526 --> 0:06:42,316
Now, when you throw all the

208
00:06:42,316 --> 0:06:43,966
items into the mix, the

209
00:06:43,966 --> 0:06:45,766
Recommender builds a graph of

210
00:06:45,836 --> 0:06:47,296
which items tend to go with

211
00:06:47,336 --> 0:06:48,236
which other items.

212
00:06:48,616 --> 0:06:49,676
How they're all related.

213
00:06:49,676 --> 0:06:51,416
And it's this graph that gets

214
00:06:51,416 --> 0:06:53,026
packaged into your model.

215
00:06:53,876 --> 0:06:55,386
All of the user data and the

216
00:06:55,386 --> 0:06:56,536
group data present in your

217
00:06:56,536 --> 0:06:58,916
training data is not explicitly

218
00:06:58,916 --> 0:07:02,296
present in the final model.

219
00:06:58,916 --> 0:07:02,296
present in the final model.

220
00:07:02,296 --> 0:07:06,786
Now, to do this in your app, the

221
00:07:06,786 --> 0:07:08,416
easiest way to build this model

222
00:07:08,416 --> 0:07:09,546
is through the Recommender

223
00:07:09,546 --> 0:07:11,596
template in the Create ML app.

224
00:07:12,806 --> 0:07:14,436
That, like all of the other

225
00:07:14,436 --> 0:07:15,796
templates, guides you through

226
00:07:15,796 --> 0:07:18,486
the process of loading your

227
00:07:19,076 --> 0:07:20,386
data, building your model,

228
00:07:21,186 --> 0:07:22,536
evaluating your model's

229
00:07:22,536 --> 0:07:24,436
performance, and exporting your

230
00:07:24,436 --> 0:07:27,036
model to Core ML.

231
00:07:27,716 --> 0:07:29,486
Now, if you want to do it

232
00:07:29,486 --> 0:07:31,546
programmatically, this is also

233
00:07:31,546 --> 0:07:33,456
possible through the Create ML

234
00:07:33,556 --> 0:07:34,016
framework.

235
00:07:34,416 --> 0:07:35,846
And here the process is the

236
00:07:35,846 --> 0:07:36,306
same.

237
00:07:37,516 --> 0:07:39,276
First we load our training data

238
00:07:39,276 --> 0:07:41,406
from a CSV file or a JSON file.

239
00:07:42,126 --> 0:07:45,126
We then specify what the group

240
00:07:45,126 --> 0:07:47,216
or user column, what's the item

241
00:07:47,216 --> 0:07:49,196
column, and optionally, which is

242
00:07:49,196 --> 0:07:50,126
the rating column.

243
00:07:51,596 --> 0:07:53,476
If we have data that's not

244
00:07:53,476 --> 0:07:55,436
present in the training data, we

245
00:07:55,436 --> 0:07:57,926
can evaluate how well our model,

246
00:07:57,926 --> 0:07:59,646
how accurately our model can

247
00:07:59,646 --> 0:08:01,886
anticipate those new data by

248
00:07:59,646 --> 0:08:01,886
anticipate those new data by

249
00:08:02,026 --> 0:08:03,996
using the model evaluate method.

250
00:08:04,346 --> 0:08:06,016
And finally, we can write this

251
00:08:06,016 --> 0:08:07,216
model out to Core ML.

252
00:08:07,766 --> 0:08:10,016
Now, in your app, you would

253
00:08:10,016 --> 0:08:11,936
locally track the interactions.

254
00:08:12,416 --> 0:08:14,786
If your model uses ratings, you

255
00:08:14,786 --> 0:08:16,186
would track a dictionary of

256
00:08:16,186 --> 0:08:17,376
items to ratings.

257
00:08:17,896 --> 0:08:19,936
Otherwise, you would simply use

258
00:08:19,936 --> 0:08:20,926
a list of items.

259
00:08:22,116 --> 0:08:23,226
Then, you would construct the

260
00:08:23,226 --> 0:08:24,596
input to your model by also

261
00:08:24,596 --> 0:08:26,756
specifying how many items you

262
00:08:26,756 --> 0:08:27,766
wanted to recommend.

263
00:08:28,266 --> 0:08:30,206
And finally, your model will

264
00:08:30,316 --> 0:08:31,966
return a ranked list of

265
00:08:32,015 --> 0:08:33,946
suggested items based on the

266
00:08:33,946 --> 0:08:36,606
input preferences it believes

267
00:08:36,796 --> 0:08:39,966
most go with your input set.

268
00:08:40,826 --> 0:08:42,635
Let me wrap this up with a few

269
00:08:42,635 --> 0:08:44,035
final considerations here.

270
00:08:45,876 --> 0:08:49,526
First, these models are very

271
00:08:49,526 --> 0:08:50,186
flexible.

272
00:08:50,776 --> 0:08:52,126
They can be used in many

273
00:08:52,126 --> 0:08:53,746
scenarios that don't fall into

274
00:08:53,746 --> 0:08:55,726
the traditional user, item,

275
00:08:56,066 --> 0:08:58,366
rating system of recommenders.

276
00:08:58,836 --> 0:09:00,496
We, I gave you several examples

277
00:08:58,836 --> 0:09:00,496
We, I gave you several examples

278
00:09:00,496 --> 0:09:02,576
here but I'm excited to see how

279
00:09:02,576 --> 0:09:04,606
you as creative app developers

280
00:09:04,736 --> 0:09:06,026
can incorporate this into the

281
00:09:06,026 --> 0:09:07,726
user experiences of your app.

282
00:09:08,856 --> 0:09:12,306
Second, these models shift with

283
00:09:12,306 --> 0:09:12,766
your app.

284
00:09:12,986 --> 0:09:14,426
That means they're on the device

285
00:09:14,426 --> 0:09:15,676
and they work offline and

286
00:09:15,676 --> 0:09:16,416
they're fast.

287
00:09:17,006 --> 0:09:18,656
It's perfect for just adding

288
00:09:18,656 --> 0:09:20,396
that touch of personalization

289
00:09:20,836 --> 0:09:22,356
into your user experience.

290
00:09:23,076 --> 0:09:25,736
Finally, because they are with

291
00:09:25,776 --> 0:09:27,296
your app and work offline, that

292
00:09:27,296 --> 0:09:28,616
means they're also privacy

293
00:09:28,616 --> 0:09:29,246
preserving.

294
00:09:30,266 --> 0:09:31,586
That way you can guarantee to

295
00:09:31,586 --> 0:09:33,626
your users that their data is

296
00:09:33,626 --> 0:09:35,916
secure, even though the app

297
00:09:35,916 --> 0:09:37,506
adapts and responds to their

298
00:09:37,506 --> 0:09:38,246
preferences.

299
00:09:39,046 --> 0:09:41,186
Finally, to wrap up this entire

300
00:09:41,186 --> 0:09:43,266
session, you heard about some

301
00:09:43,266 --> 0:09:44,976
amazing new advances in text

302
00:09:44,976 --> 0:09:46,726
classification that allow us to

303
00:09:46,726 --> 0:09:48,316
take advantage of the semantic

304
00:09:48,366 --> 0:09:50,786
meaning of the text, even with

305
00:09:50,786 --> 0:09:52,076
the limited amount of input

306
00:09:52,076 --> 0:09:52,416
data.

307
00:09:53,826 --> 0:09:54,996
You also heard about the new

308
00:09:54,996 --> 0:09:57,066
activity classification, which

309
00:09:57,066 --> 0:09:58,536
allows you to understand and

310
00:09:58,536 --> 0:10:00,146
assign meaning to the motion and

311
00:09:58,536 --> 0:10:00,146
assign meaning to the motion and

312
00:10:00,146 --> 0:10:01,336
activities of your user.

313
00:10:02,286 --> 0:10:04,116
And finally, I just introduced

314
00:10:04,116 --> 0:10:06,256
the recommender which allows you

315
00:10:06,256 --> 0:10:08,426
to personalize the user

316
00:10:08,426 --> 0:10:09,656
experience of your app into the

317
00:10:09,656 --> 0:10:11,126
many, many different ways.

318
00:10:12,076 --> 0:10:14,366

319
00:10:14,366 --> 0:10:15,726
these things, please visit the
