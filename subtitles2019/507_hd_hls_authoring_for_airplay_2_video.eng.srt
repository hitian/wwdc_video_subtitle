00:00:06,276 --> 0:00:08,116
&gt;&gt; Hi, my name is Eryk Vershen.

3
00:00:08,316 --> 0:00:09,826
I'm an engineer on the HLS

4
00:00:09,826 --> 0:00:10,676
Streaming Team.

5
00:00:11,336 --> 0:00:12,906
Let's get started talking about

6
00:00:12,906 --> 0:00:14,656
HLS Authoring for AirPlay 2

7
00:00:14,656 --> 0:00:15,186
Video.

8
00:00:17,106 --> 0:00:19,016
Ever since we introduced AirPlay

9
00:00:19,016 --> 0:00:21,136
on iOS users have enjoyed

10
00:00:21,136 --> 0:00:22,996
AirPlaying video to their Apple

11
00:00:22,996 --> 0:00:26,216
TVs and starting this year we're

12
00:00:26,216 --> 0:00:27,546
expanding that support

13
00:00:27,546 --> 0:00:29,926
dramatically with AirPlay built

14
00:00:29,926 --> 0:00:31,456
directly into TVs.

15
00:00:32,896 --> 0:00:35,906
Apple TV and AirPlay capable TVs

16
00:00:36,256 --> 0:00:37,736
both provide the highest quality

17
00:00:37,736 --> 0:00:39,196
video playback experience.

18
00:00:40,326 --> 0:00:41,496
You may remember that we have

19
00:00:41,496 --> 0:00:43,406
some specific requirements for

20
00:00:43,406 --> 0:00:45,476
content delivered to tvOS and

21
00:00:45,476 --> 0:00:46,246
Apple TV.

22
00:00:46,826 --> 0:00:48,956
These AirPlay capable TVs are a

23
00:00:48,956 --> 0:00:50,676
new class of devices so they

24
00:00:50,676 --> 0:00:52,096
have their own requirements.

25
00:00:53,636 --> 0:00:55,076
We have a simple agenda.

26
00:00:55,076 --> 0:00:56,886
I'll cover the new requirements

27
00:00:56,936 --> 0:00:58,596
and then I'll talk about changes

28
00:00:58,596 --> 0:01:00,296
we made to the validation tools

29
00:00:58,596 --> 0:01:00,296
we made to the validation tools

30
00:01:00,296 --> 0:01:01,816
to help you check for issues.

31
00:01:04,316 --> 0:01:06,606
We released a new version of the

32
00:01:06,606 --> 0:01:08,206
HLS authoring specification

33
00:01:08,206 --> 0:01:09,676
recently that talks about the

34
00:01:09,676 --> 0:01:11,376
additional requirements for

35
00:01:11,376 --> 0:01:12,076
AirPlay 2.

36
00:01:14,356 --> 0:01:15,996
Here is a condensed list.

37
00:01:16,116 --> 0:01:18,136
Don't worry about absorbing this

38
00:01:18,136 --> 0:01:18,856
list right now.

39
00:01:18,856 --> 0:01:20,366
I'll devote a whole slide to

40
00:01:20,366 --> 0:01:21,266
each line item.

41
00:01:21,846 --> 0:01:25,346
Let's look at the details.

42
00:01:25,346 --> 0:01:26,536
You need to synchronize the

43
00:01:26,536 --> 0:01:27,576
different variants.

44
00:01:27,866 --> 0:01:29,346
This makes switching easier.

45
00:01:30,146 --> 0:01:31,626
If these color bars represent

46
00:01:31,626 --> 0:01:32,576
different variants on a

47
00:01:32,576 --> 0:01:35,806
timeline, what we want to do is

48
00:01:35,806 --> 0:01:37,756
make them all line up nicely.

49
00:01:38,086 --> 0:01:39,856
We are recommending that you use

50
00:01:39,856 --> 0:01:41,526
at least millisecond precision

51
00:01:42,426 --> 0:01:44,186
and as always your video

52
00:01:44,186 --> 0:01:46,206
segments should start with IDR

53
00:01:46,206 --> 0:01:46,856
frames.

54
00:01:48,296 --> 0:01:49,756
You also want to avoid most

55
00:01:49,756 --> 0:01:51,246
changes of discontinuities.

56
00:01:51,426 --> 0:01:53,396
For example, do not switch

57
00:01:53,396 --> 0:01:56,296
between HEVC and H.264 or

58
00:01:56,296 --> 0:01:58,196
between AAC and Dolby Digital.

59
00:01:59,156 --> 0:02:01,146
These TVs aren't able to switch

60
00:01:59,156 --> 0:02:01,146
These TVs aren't able to switch

61
00:02:01,146 --> 0:02:03,076
as seamlessly as iOS or Apple

62
00:02:03,076 --> 0:02:03,576
TV.

63
00:02:04,786 --> 0:02:06,116
You can change your frame rate

64
00:02:06,116 --> 0:02:07,286
but not arbitrarily.

65
00:02:07,556 --> 0:02:09,306
No switching between 25 frame

66
00:02:09,306 --> 0:02:10,515
per second and 30.

67
00:02:13,606 --> 0:02:15,146
You also want each codec to

68
00:02:15,146 --> 0:02:16,596
provide a good set of variance

69
00:02:16,596 --> 0:02:17,416
on its own.

70
00:02:18,076 --> 0:02:19,646
These TVs will stick with the

71
00:02:19,646 --> 0:02:20,696
codec they start with.

72
00:02:21,156 --> 0:02:23,116
So, in particular, don't try to

73
00:02:23,116 --> 0:02:25,166
use H.264 just for low

74
00:02:25,166 --> 0:02:27,276
resolution video and HEVC for

75
00:02:27,276 --> 0:02:28,486
high-resolution video.

76
00:02:29,026 --> 0:02:30,766
That works on other devices but

77
00:02:30,766 --> 0:02:31,406
not here.

78
00:02:32,526 --> 0:02:33,766
You should, of course, be using

79
00:02:33,766 --> 0:02:34,946
I-frame variance.

80
00:02:34,946 --> 0:02:36,716
They make fast-forward, rewind

81
00:02:36,716 --> 0:02:38,066
and seeking more effective.

82
00:02:38,686 --> 0:02:40,186
Because these devices don't want

83
00:02:40,186 --> 0:02:41,706
to switch codecs you need to

84
00:02:41,706 --> 0:02:43,416
have a set of I-frame variance

85
00:02:43,416 --> 0:02:44,946
matching the codec of the normal

86
00:02:44,946 --> 0:02:45,436
video.

87
00:02:48,276 --> 0:02:49,676
The encryption requirements

88
00:02:49,676 --> 0:02:51,226
listed here aren't really

89
00:02:51,226 --> 0:02:53,216
specific to AirPlay 2, but we

90
00:02:53,216 --> 0:02:54,266
wanted to call them out.

91
00:02:55,466 --> 0:02:57,066
The common encryption standard

92
00:02:57,066 --> 0:02:58,906
recommends 10% partial

93
00:02:58,906 --> 0:02:59,446
encryption.

94
00:02:59,996 --> 0:03:01,676
With FairPlay we are requiring

95
00:02:59,996 --> 0:03:01,676
With FairPlay we are requiring

96
00:03:01,676 --> 0:03:03,456
it; other patterns will not

97
00:03:03,456 --> 0:03:03,866
work.

98
00:03:04,916 --> 0:03:06,446
For sample encryption there are

99
00:03:06,446 --> 0:03:07,506
two ways to market.

100
00:03:08,066 --> 0:03:10,836
The CMAF way with an senc box

101
00:03:11,076 --> 0:03:12,586
and the ISO base media file

102
00:03:12,586 --> 0:03:14,926
format way with a pair of saio

103
00:03:14,926 --> 0:03:16,726
and saiz boxes.

104
00:03:17,056 --> 0:03:18,706
We prefer the second form, but

105
00:03:18,706 --> 0:03:19,746
you can provide both.

106
00:03:21,726 --> 0:03:23,156
Lastly, some miscellaneous

107
00:03:23,156 --> 0:03:23,866
requirements.

108
00:03:24,376 --> 0:03:25,846
If you want to provide HDR

109
00:03:25,846 --> 0:03:27,456
content, your best bet is to

110
00:03:27,456 --> 0:03:29,206
provide multiple formats.

111
00:03:29,206 --> 0:03:30,956
For example, Dolby Vision and

112
00:03:30,956 --> 0:03:33,536
HDR 10 as TVs may support only

113
00:03:33,536 --> 0:03:37,256
one of the formats, use WebVTT

114
00:03:37,256 --> 0:03:40,096
for subtitles and we are now

115
00:03:40,096 --> 0:03:41,916
recommending MIME types for all

116
00:03:41,916 --> 0:03:42,606
your content.

117
00:03:42,766 --> 0:03:44,426
Let's go into little more detail

118
00:03:44,426 --> 0:03:45,006
about that.

119
00:03:46,166 --> 0:03:48,196
We've had a MIME type for HLS

120
00:03:48,196 --> 0:03:49,556
playlist for a long time.

121
00:03:50,116 --> 0:03:51,656
The MIME types we are suggesting

122
00:03:51,656 --> 0:03:53,296
for video and audio are what you

123
00:03:53,296 --> 0:03:54,076
might expect.

124
00:03:55,126 --> 0:03:56,756
Notice we are using text/plain

125
00:03:56,756 --> 0:03:58,626
for WebVTT even though the

126
00:03:58,626 --> 0:04:01,576
WebVTT spec says text/VTT.

127
00:03:58,626 --> 0:04:01,576
WebVTT spec says text/VTT.

128
00:04:01,576 --> 0:04:04,846
However, the text VTT type was

129
00:04:04,846 --> 0:04:06,796
not registered with the IANA and

130
00:04:06,966 --> 0:04:08,796
will be rejected by some

131
00:04:08,796 --> 0:04:09,366
clients.

132
00:04:09,586 --> 0:04:11,886
So use text/plain instead.

133
00:04:14,136 --> 0:04:15,386
Here's a list of some of the

134
00:04:15,386 --> 0:04:16,896
less common MIME types.

135
00:04:17,196 --> 0:04:18,875
Now the last 2 on this list are

136
00:04:18,875 --> 0:04:20,446
not applicable to AirPlay 2

137
00:04:20,446 --> 0:04:21,116
content.

138
00:04:21,326 --> 0:04:22,476
I've listed them because we are

139
00:04:22,476 --> 0:04:24,026
recommending MIME types for all

140
00:04:24,026 --> 0:04:25,866
content not just AirPlay 2.

141
00:04:26,366 --> 0:04:30,146
Let's turn to how you can check

142
00:04:30,146 --> 0:04:30,906
your streams.

143
00:04:33,676 --> 0:04:34,776
Remember that there are two

144
00:04:34,776 --> 0:04:36,936
tools for HLS validation.

145
00:04:37,566 --> 0:04:39,036
These tools are complementary.

146
00:04:39,416 --> 0:04:41,796
Mediastreamvalidator is checking

147
00:04:41,796 --> 0:04:44,296
against the HLS specification.

148
00:04:44,296 --> 0:04:45,786
HLSreport on the other hand is

149
00:04:45,786 --> 0:04:47,136
checking against the authoring

150
00:04:47,136 --> 0:04:47,986
specification.

151
00:04:48,586 --> 0:04:50,296
You should always be using both

152
00:04:50,296 --> 0:04:50,856
tools.

153
00:04:51,186 --> 0:04:52,596
I suggest you make a script that

154
00:04:52,596 --> 0:04:53,656
runs them as a pair.

155
00:04:55,356 --> 0:04:56,916
We've made an important change

156
00:04:56,916 --> 0:04:58,016
to HLSreport.

157
00:04:58,596 --> 0:05:00,086
Formerly you had to run it

158
00:04:58,596 --> 0:05:00,086
Formerly you had to run it

159
00:05:00,086 --> 0:05:02,206
multiple times with the dash os

160
00:05:02,206 --> 0:05:03,556
option if you wanted to check

161
00:05:03,556 --> 0:05:05,836
the rules for iOS and TVOS.

162
00:05:06,706 --> 0:05:08,676
Now it checks all rule sets by

163
00:05:08,676 --> 0:05:10,456
default including the rules for

164
00:05:10,456 --> 0:05:11,216
AirPlay 2.

165
00:05:12,446 --> 0:05:14,346
The rule set option is there to

166
00:05:14,346 --> 0:05:15,726
modify the sets you check but

167
00:05:15,726 --> 0:05:17,206
most of you won't need to use

168
00:05:17,206 --> 0:05:17,366
it.

169
00:05:17,366 --> 0:05:19,586
And while the OS option does

170
00:05:19,586 --> 0:05:21,156
still work, you should stop

171
00:05:21,156 --> 0:05:21,706
using it.

172
00:05:23,656 --> 0:05:25,376
Let's look at how the output

173
00:05:25,376 --> 0:05:27,116
from HLSreport has changed.

174
00:05:27,116 --> 0:05:30,326
Notice that the title line now

175
00:05:30,326 --> 0:05:32,056
shows all the rule sets that

176
00:05:32,056 --> 0:05:32,656
were checked.

177
00:05:34,856 --> 0:05:37,126
The rules portion is now grouped

178
00:05:37,126 --> 0:05:38,886
into sections for each rule set.

179
00:05:39,656 --> 0:05:40,736
Here we have the general

180
00:05:40,736 --> 0:05:41,456
requirements.

181
00:05:42,026 --> 0:05:43,696
There can be Must Fix and Should

182
00:05:43,696 --> 0:05:45,766
Fix subsections for each rule

183
00:05:45,766 --> 0:05:46,116
set.

184
00:05:48,006 --> 0:05:49,576
Now farther down in the output

185
00:05:49,576 --> 0:05:51,366
we have the iOS requirements.

186
00:05:51,526 --> 0:05:54,096
I want you to notice that rule

187
00:05:54,096 --> 0:05:56,136
10 above here the last general

188
00:05:56,136 --> 0:05:58,166
rule is marked as Should Fix.

189
00:05:58,886 --> 0:06:01,666
Whereas here in the AirPlay 2

190
00:05:58,886 --> 0:06:01,666
Whereas here in the AirPlay 2

191
00:06:01,666 --> 0:06:03,566
section the same rule is a Must

192
00:06:03,566 --> 0:06:03,926
Fix.

193
00:06:04,536 --> 0:06:07,966
If there are no rule violations

194
00:06:07,966 --> 0:06:09,516
for a section or subsection,

195
00:06:09,676 --> 0:06:10,956
then that section or subsection

196
00:06:10,956 --> 0:06:11,586
is dropped.

197
00:06:12,156 --> 0:06:13,876
For example, this stream has no

198
00:06:13,876 --> 0:06:15,566
Should F ixes for AirPlay 2.

199
00:06:17,716 --> 0:06:19,656
The main points to take away are

200
00:06:19,846 --> 0:06:21,496
we added new requirements for

201
00:06:21,496 --> 0:06:22,726
AirPlay 2 devices.

202
00:06:23,476 --> 0:06:25,456
Remember to use HLSreport so you

203
00:06:25,456 --> 0:06:26,616
check against the authoring

204
00:06:26,616 --> 0:06:27,466
specification.

205
00:06:27,956 --> 0:06:30,496
And HLSreport now checks all

206
00:06:30,496 --> 0:06:31,906
rule sets by default.

207
00:06:33,796 --> 0:06:36,006
This is session 507 so you know

208
00:06:36,006 --> 0:06:37,276
where to go for more info.

209
00:06:37,776 --> 0:06:39,066
We'll have links there to the

210
00:06:39,066 --> 0:06:40,446
authoring specification to the

211
00:06:40,446 --> 0:06:42,086
tools and to other information

212
00:06:42,086 --> 0:06:43,126
about HLS.

213
00:06:44,196 --> 0:06:45,316
Thanks for your attention.

214
00:06:45,316 --> 0:06:46,456
Have a great rest of the

215
00:06:46,456 --> 0:06:46,946
conference.
