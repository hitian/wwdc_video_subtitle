00:00:13,126 --> 0:00:13,556
&gt;&gt; Good day.

4
00:00:13,936 --> 0:00:18,066
Welcome. Over the past year, my

5
00:00:18,066 --> 0:00:20,246
team and I have been reimagining

6
00:00:20,406 --> 0:00:22,826
the Apple TV experience.

7
00:00:23,846 --> 0:00:25,986
We've been testing ideas and

8
00:00:26,136 --> 0:00:28,456
exploring ways to bring the fun

9
00:00:28,866 --> 0:00:30,336
back into browsing.

10
00:00:32,176 --> 0:00:33,916
Today, we're going to share with

11
00:00:33,916 --> 0:00:36,496
you our approach to mastering

12
00:00:36,496 --> 0:00:38,606
the living room and connecting

13
00:00:38,606 --> 0:00:41,666
people more thoughtfully to the

14
00:00:41,666 --> 0:00:42,686
content they love.

15
00:00:45,336 --> 0:00:47,336
My name is Tommy Payne.

16
00:00:47,966 --> 0:00:48,866
My friends call me T.

17
00:00:48,866 --> 0:00:50,996
Payne, and I'm a designer here

18
00:00:50,996 --> 0:00:51,436
at Apple.

19
00:00:53,066 --> 0:00:55,196
Growing up in Australia, the

20
00:00:55,196 --> 0:00:57,496
rest of the world felt very far

21
00:00:57,496 --> 0:00:59,496
away, and I was searching for

22
00:00:59,496 --> 0:01:00,446
ways to connect.

23
00:00:59,496 --> 0:01:00,446
ways to connect.

24
00:01:00,446 --> 0:01:02,426
I was interested and curious

25
00:01:02,426 --> 0:01:03,686
about other cultures, other

26
00:01:03,686 --> 0:01:05,346
people, different areas and

27
00:01:05,346 --> 0:01:06,136
environments.

28
00:01:07,176 --> 0:01:12,456
So I looked to TV and movies to

29
00:01:12,696 --> 0:01:14,006
bridge that connection.

30
00:01:15,116 --> 0:01:16,406
And I would come home from

31
00:01:16,406 --> 0:01:18,736
school, plunk down on the couch,

32
00:01:18,896 --> 0:01:19,906
and turn on the tele.

33
00:01:20,786 --> 0:01:22,056
And I would start to channel

34
00:01:22,146 --> 0:01:25,936
surf, flicking up and down until

35
00:01:25,936 --> 0:01:27,496
something caught my attention.

36
00:01:27,896 --> 0:01:29,306
And when it did, I was

37
00:01:29,366 --> 0:01:30,186
captivated.

38
00:01:30,186 --> 0:01:31,866
I was engrossed.

39
00:01:31,866 --> 0:01:34,066
I was drawn into that story.

40
00:01:36,576 --> 0:01:40,866
Picture in your mind a film or

41
00:01:40,866 --> 0:01:42,896
TV show that you connected with.

42
00:01:44,126 --> 0:01:46,336
Think about how it made you feel

43
00:01:46,886 --> 0:01:50,496
and how time and space melted

44
00:01:50,496 --> 0:01:53,566
away when it's just you living

45
00:01:54,626 --> 0:01:55,656
that drama.

46
00:01:56,096 --> 0:01:58,676
Now, hold on to that feeling as

47
00:01:58,676 --> 0:01:59,346
we continue.

48
00:01:59,596 --> 0:02:01,186
I'm not going to be talking

49
00:01:59,596 --> 0:02:01,186
I'm not going to be talking

50
00:02:01,186 --> 0:02:02,616
about code, but my friends will

51
00:02:02,616 --> 0:02:03,066
get to that.

52
00:02:03,386 --> 0:02:06,176
I'm going to talk about the joy

53
00:02:06,996 --> 0:02:07,896
of discovery.

54
00:02:09,186 --> 0:02:11,926
How do we get people into what

55
00:02:11,926 --> 0:02:14,446
they want to watch quicker and

56
00:02:14,446 --> 0:02:16,546
remove barriers to entry?

57
00:02:18,116 --> 0:02:20,566
The current state of TV, well,

58
00:02:20,956 --> 0:02:22,316
it's kind of tedious.

59
00:02:22,946 --> 0:02:24,436
You're presented with rows and

60
00:02:24,436 --> 0:02:26,286
rows and rows of content to

61
00:02:26,286 --> 0:02:27,366
scroll through.

62
00:02:28,246 --> 0:02:31,186
Who here has spent five minutes,

63
00:02:32,106 --> 0:02:34,556
10 minutes, 20 minutes just

64
00:02:34,756 --> 0:02:36,476
searching for something to

65
00:02:36,476 --> 0:02:36,936
watch?

66
00:02:37,516 --> 0:02:40,076
It's a common and frustrating

67
00:02:40,076 --> 0:02:40,566
experience.

68
00:02:40,566 --> 0:02:45,276
And in that, we've become

69
00:02:45,276 --> 0:02:47,786
paralyzed by choice and robbed

70
00:02:47,786 --> 0:02:48,716
by indecision.

71
00:02:51,156 --> 0:02:53,626
So, that's the problem.

72
00:02:54,736 --> 0:02:55,966
Now, let's talk about the

73
00:02:55,966 --> 0:02:56,486
solution.

74
00:02:58,876 --> 0:03:01,816
Apple TV has purposefully

75
00:02:58,876 --> 0:03:01,816
Apple TV has purposefully

76
00:03:02,056 --> 0:03:04,896
migrated its designs towards a

77
00:03:04,966 --> 0:03:07,666
content first experience.

78
00:03:08,346 --> 0:03:10,006
And all that really means is

79
00:03:10,146 --> 0:03:11,266
something's on, something's

80
00:03:11,336 --> 0:03:11,956
playing.

81
00:03:12,066 --> 0:03:13,266
When you launch into the

82
00:03:13,266 --> 0:03:15,546
application, it's alive.

83
00:03:16,526 --> 0:03:20,156
So, I'm going to break down for

84
00:03:20,156 --> 0:03:22,576
you how to achieve a content

85
00:03:22,576 --> 0:03:24,646
first experience with some best

86
00:03:24,646 --> 0:03:26,426
practices, and I'm going to use

87
00:03:26,426 --> 0:03:28,346
examples from the redesign of

88
00:03:28,386 --> 0:03:30,616
Top Shelf and a couple from our

89
00:03:30,616 --> 0:03:31,906
own TV app.

90
00:03:35,756 --> 0:03:37,986
First of all, we want to remove

91
00:03:38,136 --> 0:03:40,426
barriers to entry, get rid of

92
00:03:40,426 --> 0:03:42,746
any hurdles between the content

93
00:03:42,896 --> 0:03:43,456
and the viewer.

94
00:03:44,396 --> 0:03:47,066
This principle is why Top Shelf

95
00:03:47,376 --> 0:03:49,376
has become interactive and

96
00:03:49,836 --> 0:03:50,826
immersive.

97
00:03:51,906 --> 0:03:52,876
Let's take a look.

98
00:04:13,086 --> 0:04:15,506
So we launch into Apple TV and

99
00:04:15,506 --> 0:04:17,255
we hold on a poster image for

100
00:04:17,255 --> 0:04:18,656
five seconds.

101
00:04:18,966 --> 0:04:21,946
After which, a trailer comes in.

102
00:04:21,946 --> 0:04:25,796
And it's important to note here

103
00:04:25,796 --> 0:04:27,666
that that trailer, we don't

104
00:04:27,666 --> 0:04:29,396
force sound on the viewer in

105
00:04:29,396 --> 0:04:30,366
this instance.

106
00:04:30,366 --> 0:04:32,816
Too much sound and video when

107
00:04:32,816 --> 0:04:34,186
you first launch into something,

108
00:04:34,186 --> 0:04:35,656
it can be destructive.

109
00:04:36,586 --> 0:04:39,156
However, we do allow people to

110
00:04:39,156 --> 0:04:40,756
invoke the audio later on in the

111
00:04:40,756 --> 0:04:41,306
experience.

112
00:04:42,076 --> 0:04:45,836
So, the content is taking up all

113
00:04:45,836 --> 0:04:46,396
the pixels.

114
00:04:46,876 --> 0:04:48,406
It's filling the screen.

115
00:04:48,856 --> 0:04:53,996
Next, we want to ensure that

116
00:04:54,376 --> 0:04:55,686
because people are now watching

117
00:04:55,686 --> 0:04:57,266
something that they can easily

118
00:04:57,296 --> 0:04:57,886
interact.

119
00:04:59,116 --> 0:05:01,296
Every swipe or click on the

120
00:04:59,116 --> 0:05:01,296
Every swipe or click on the

121
00:05:01,296 --> 0:05:03,156
remote, it adds to somebody's

122
00:05:03,156 --> 0:05:04,026
cognitive load.

123
00:05:04,546 --> 0:05:06,436
So we want to reduce the number

124
00:05:06,436 --> 0:05:08,176
of steps it takes for them to

125
00:05:08,176 --> 0:05:09,906
achieve their task.

126
00:05:11,256 --> 0:05:15,506
In Top Shelf, we use a visual

127
00:05:15,506 --> 0:05:17,846
hint in the upper part of the

128
00:05:17,846 --> 0:05:20,456
screen, and this tells people

129
00:05:20,526 --> 0:05:22,406
swipe up to enter into full

130
00:05:22,406 --> 0:05:22,996
screen mode.

131
00:05:23,606 --> 0:05:24,896
Let's take a look at that in

132
00:05:24,896 --> 0:05:25,376
action.

133
00:05:26,236 --> 0:05:27,976
The user will place their thumb

134
00:05:27,976 --> 0:05:30,326
on the remote and swipe up, at

135
00:05:30,746 --> 0:05:33,876
which point the dock flies away

136
00:05:34,236 --> 0:05:36,146
and you're left with just the

137
00:05:36,146 --> 0:05:38,616
trailer playing in all its glory

138
00:05:38,766 --> 0:05:39,916
filling the screen.

139
00:05:41,096 --> 0:05:43,226
So you're still actually in a

140
00:05:43,226 --> 0:05:45,766
browse mode but it feels like

141
00:05:45,766 --> 0:05:47,076
playback, it feels like you're

142
00:05:47,076 --> 0:05:48,716
inside the movie which is really

143
00:05:48,716 --> 0:05:49,036
cool.

144
00:05:50,506 --> 0:05:53,096
Anywhere that we can streamline

145
00:05:53,096 --> 0:05:55,506
interactions, that's a good

146
00:05:55,506 --> 0:05:56,686
thing for our viewers.

147
00:05:57,006 --> 0:05:58,406
So we've borrowed this

148
00:05:58,406 --> 0:06:00,376
interaction from inside of TV

149
00:05:58,406 --> 0:06:00,376
interaction from inside of TV

150
00:06:00,586 --> 0:06:02,536
app where we use it to invoke

151
00:06:02,536 --> 0:06:04,446
and hide menus in the playback

152
00:06:04,446 --> 0:06:05,086
experience.

153
00:06:05,356 --> 0:06:07,636
So by leveraging that knowledge

154
00:06:07,776 --> 0:06:09,036
that already exists in the

155
00:06:09,036 --> 0:06:11,176
viewer's mind, we're making it

156
00:06:11,176 --> 0:06:12,296
easier because they don't have

157
00:06:12,296 --> 0:06:13,906
to learn something from scratch

158
00:06:14,236 --> 0:06:15,726
in this new context.

159
00:06:16,376 --> 0:06:19,276
So now that people are

160
00:06:19,276 --> 0:06:21,746
interacting, you want the app

161
00:06:22,656 --> 0:06:24,626
and the experience to feel

162
00:06:24,626 --> 0:06:25,246
responsive.

163
00:06:25,606 --> 0:06:27,686
Speed and pacing are essential

164
00:06:27,686 --> 0:06:29,836
ingredients for minimizing

165
00:06:29,836 --> 0:06:31,226
cognitive load.

166
00:06:31,566 --> 0:06:33,636
Try and remove latency and lag

167
00:06:33,766 --> 0:06:35,056
anywhere you can in your app.

168
00:06:35,396 --> 0:06:37,636
That way, it will feel dynamic,

169
00:06:37,636 --> 0:06:38,996
it will feel fluid.

170
00:06:41,896 --> 0:06:43,736
We also want to avoid

171
00:06:43,736 --> 0:06:45,576
overstimulating people.

172
00:06:46,186 --> 0:06:49,356
Closet, chaotic, and distracting

173
00:06:49,356 --> 0:06:51,186
interfaces, well, they derail

174
00:06:51,186 --> 0:06:53,616
somebody from their task.

175
00:06:53,876 --> 0:06:55,546
Imagine if you will you're

176
00:06:55,546 --> 0:06:59,416
standing in a room and 11 people

177
00:06:59,416 --> 0:07:01,296
are talking to you loudly all at

178
00:06:59,416 --> 0:07:01,296
are talking to you loudly all at

179
00:07:01,296 --> 0:07:01,596
once.

180
00:07:03,146 --> 0:07:04,516
You can't hear what any one

181
00:07:04,516 --> 0:07:05,486
person is saying.

182
00:07:10,656 --> 0:07:15,106
If TV app interfaces do this as

183
00:07:15,106 --> 0:07:17,886
well, people can't focus.

184
00:07:18,836 --> 0:07:20,956
By using too many animations,

185
00:07:20,956 --> 0:07:22,806
icons, images and text styles,

186
00:07:24,006 --> 0:07:25,526
it competes for somebody's

187
00:07:25,526 --> 0:07:26,046
attention.

188
00:07:26,976 --> 0:07:28,736
And we don't want somebody be--

189
00:07:28,786 --> 0:07:30,286
to be in that competitive

190
00:07:30,286 --> 0:07:30,886
mindset.

191
00:07:31,126 --> 0:07:33,466
We want them to be focused and

192
00:07:34,446 --> 0:07:34,666
relaxed.

193
00:07:38,496 --> 0:07:39,916
Now, that we've made them in

194
00:07:39,916 --> 0:07:41,826
this kind of relaxed state, we

195
00:07:41,826 --> 0:07:44,036
can think about diversifying the

196
00:07:44,036 --> 0:07:46,466
types of content in our UI.

197
00:07:47,046 --> 0:07:48,586
And just means playing with

198
00:07:48,586 --> 0:07:50,196
shapes and aspect ratios,

199
00:07:50,476 --> 0:07:51,716
breaking the grid from time to

200
00:07:51,716 --> 0:07:52,066
time.

201
00:07:53,186 --> 0:07:55,436
In our own TV app, we've done

202
00:07:55,436 --> 0:07:57,766
this by interspersing a

203
00:07:57,966 --> 0:08:00,126
different kind of module in

204
00:07:57,966 --> 0:08:00,126
different kind of module in

205
00:08:00,126 --> 0:08:02,446
amongst the standard 16 by 9

206
00:08:03,256 --> 0:08:03,676
rows.

207
00:08:03,676 --> 0:08:04,706
Now, this allows us to do a

208
00:08:04,706 --> 0:08:05,386
couple of things.

209
00:08:06,146 --> 0:08:08,356
First, it gives us, the

210
00:08:08,356 --> 0:08:10,846
provider, a place to highlight

211
00:08:10,846 --> 0:08:12,336
something that's of great

212
00:08:12,336 --> 0:08:14,466
importance, something that is

213
00:08:14,466 --> 0:08:16,506
really meaningful that we want

214
00:08:16,506 --> 0:08:17,226
you to notice.

215
00:08:17,786 --> 0:08:20,806
And for the viewer, it allows

216
00:08:20,806 --> 0:08:23,556
their eye a moment of pause.

217
00:08:24,366 --> 0:08:25,776
As they're scanning through

218
00:08:25,776 --> 0:08:28,046
these dense grids, creating

219
00:08:28,046 --> 0:08:30,206
something like this gives them a

220
00:08:30,246 --> 0:08:31,586
time to breathe.

221
00:08:31,696 --> 0:08:37,806
We want to reduce the canvas to

222
00:08:37,806 --> 0:08:40,166
simple noncompeting elements.

223
00:08:41,066 --> 0:08:42,576
And this means we create a

224
00:08:42,576 --> 0:08:43,256
hierarchy.

225
00:08:45,176 --> 0:08:47,626
In the Top Shelf design, the

226
00:08:47,626 --> 0:08:49,866
content is of highest priority,

227
00:08:50,136 --> 0:08:51,766
so it fills the screen.

228
00:08:52,206 --> 0:08:54,556
Then we have the app dock and a

229
00:08:54,556 --> 0:08:56,116
picking row below that in the

230
00:08:56,116 --> 0:08:57,666
lower third, and they're of

231
00:08:57,726 --> 0:08:59,246
slightly less importance.

232
00:08:59,246 --> 0:09:01,376
And by prioritizing elements,

233
00:08:59,246 --> 0:09:01,376
And by prioritizing elements,

234
00:09:02,396 --> 0:09:04,616
you help people to navigate.

235
00:09:05,956 --> 0:09:08,686
You help people by leading them

236
00:09:08,806 --> 0:09:10,286
through the experience.

237
00:09:14,426 --> 0:09:16,916
Now, meta-data, it's useful but

238
00:09:17,156 --> 0:09:19,836
secondary in the content first

239
00:09:19,976 --> 0:09:21,706
experience of Top Shelf.

240
00:09:22,156 --> 0:09:23,886
Because initially we want to get

241
00:09:23,886 --> 0:09:25,576
people excited about what

242
00:09:25,576 --> 0:09:27,526
they're watching, and then we

243
00:09:27,526 --> 0:09:30,626
signal that there's more info

244
00:09:30,626 --> 0:09:31,406
available.

245
00:09:32,626 --> 0:09:33,706
Let's take a look.

246
00:09:55,416 --> 0:09:58,376
So the person was inside the

247
00:09:58,376 --> 0:10:00,576
full screen experience of Top

248
00:09:58,376 --> 0:10:00,576
full screen experience of Top

249
00:10:00,576 --> 0:10:02,516
Shelf, and they've rested their

250
00:10:02,516 --> 0:10:04,226
thumb on the remote or clicked

251
00:10:04,676 --> 0:10:07,686
and that invoked the meta-data.

252
00:10:08,046 --> 0:10:09,766
By giving control to the viewer

253
00:10:09,766 --> 0:10:12,336
over the how and when to access

254
00:10:12,336 --> 0:10:14,266
this extra information, the path

255
00:10:14,266 --> 0:10:16,236
to pressing play and watching

256
00:10:16,236 --> 0:10:17,766
the whole film becomes

257
00:10:18,006 --> 0:10:18,616
simplified.

258
00:10:19,156 --> 0:10:22,026
And what's more, meta-data can

259
00:10:22,026 --> 0:10:23,906
help someone change their mind

260
00:10:23,906 --> 0:10:26,236
from being in a browse mode to

261
00:10:26,236 --> 0:10:28,286
perhaps purchase, or from

262
00:10:28,286 --> 0:10:29,906
browsing to subscribe.

263
00:10:32,656 --> 0:10:34,906
Now pagination dots, they

264
00:10:34,906 --> 0:10:36,806
communicate that you're viewing

265
00:10:36,806 --> 0:10:38,896
one item in a set.

266
00:10:39,816 --> 0:10:43,356
They also indicate the duration

267
00:10:43,416 --> 0:10:44,926
of the browsing experience.

268
00:10:46,406 --> 0:10:48,566
In our design, they're kept

269
00:10:48,566 --> 0:10:50,206
small at the lower part of the

270
00:10:50,346 --> 0:10:51,786
screen and they kind of look

271
00:10:51,786 --> 0:10:52,626
like bread crumbs.

272
00:10:53,026 --> 0:10:55,246
And we've used Apple TV system

273
00:10:55,246 --> 0:10:57,546
materials to ensure that they

274
00:10:57,546 --> 0:10:59,506
contrast from any imagery that

275
00:10:59,506 --> 0:11:00,606
they sit on top of.

276
00:10:59,506 --> 0:11:00,606
they sit on top of.

277
00:11:01,156 --> 0:11:02,346
We think they make great

278
00:11:02,346 --> 0:11:04,606
additions to your applications

279
00:11:05,416 --> 0:11:07,416
as well.

280
00:11:08,076 --> 0:11:09,956
Chevrons indicate swipe

281
00:11:09,996 --> 0:11:12,176
directions, up, down, left,

282
00:11:12,176 --> 0:11:14,916
right, but they do something

283
00:11:15,856 --> 0:11:16,176
else.

284
00:11:16,246 --> 0:11:19,346
They hint at content just off

285
00:11:19,536 --> 0:11:20,106
screen.

286
00:11:21,366 --> 0:11:23,696
Together with pagination dots,

287
00:11:24,026 --> 0:11:25,806
they help give somebody a sense

288
00:11:25,846 --> 0:11:28,576
of place and ground them in the

289
00:11:28,576 --> 0:11:28,986
UI.

290
00:11:29,776 --> 0:11:31,676
And these little pieces of UI,

291
00:11:32,006 --> 0:11:34,256
they're important tools, because

292
00:11:34,256 --> 0:11:36,286
they help people avoid having to

293
00:11:36,286 --> 0:11:37,906
trip and stumble asking

294
00:11:37,906 --> 0:11:39,586
questions, like is this

295
00:11:39,586 --> 0:11:41,686
clickable, how do I navigate out

296
00:11:41,686 --> 0:11:43,726
of here, and, can I get back to

297
00:11:44,546 --> 0:11:45,356
this later?

298
00:11:45,596 --> 0:11:47,446
All these kinds of questions

299
00:11:48,006 --> 0:11:49,976
risk ruining somebody's

300
00:11:50,106 --> 0:11:50,696
experience.

301
00:11:51,466 --> 0:11:56,026
So with the redesigned Top

302
00:11:56,026 --> 0:11:58,446
Shelf, we've enhanced the best

303
00:11:59,116 --> 0:12:00,706
parts of browsing.

304
00:11:59,116 --> 0:12:00,706
parts of browsing.

305
00:12:01,736 --> 0:12:04,276
We used edge-to-edge content,

306
00:12:04,276 --> 0:12:05,776
taking up the full real estate

307
00:12:05,776 --> 0:12:07,506
available to us.

308
00:12:07,506 --> 0:12:09,766
We have familiar navigational

309
00:12:09,766 --> 0:12:12,456
queues, helpful meta-data and

310
00:12:12,456 --> 0:12:14,006
simple gestures.

311
00:12:18,036 --> 0:12:19,596
But the best part about it is

312
00:12:19,646 --> 0:12:22,236
that it feels familiar.

313
00:12:23,166 --> 0:12:24,836
It feels like when I was a kid

314
00:12:24,836 --> 0:12:25,846
channel surfing.

315
00:12:26,436 --> 0:12:29,406
I'm able to go back and forth

316
00:12:29,406 --> 0:12:31,776
until something captivates me.

317
00:12:38,106 --> 0:12:40,276
So if you can use a few of these

318
00:12:40,276 --> 0:12:41,916
techniques and principles in

319
00:12:41,916 --> 0:12:44,536
your own designs, it will make

320
00:12:44,536 --> 0:12:46,276
for wonderfully thoughtful

321
00:12:46,276 --> 0:12:47,206
applications.

322
00:12:48,516 --> 0:12:53,036
At Apple, we believe in the

323
00:12:53,146 --> 0:12:56,326
power of content first.

324
00:12:57,496 --> 0:13:00,246
It's what's best for the viewer.

325
00:12:57,496 --> 0:13:00,246
It's what's best for the viewer.

326
00:13:00,376 --> 0:13:03,996
And collectively as we design

327
00:13:03,996 --> 0:13:06,086
this vehicle that delivers great

328
00:13:06,086 --> 0:13:08,616
content, that can have huge

329
00:13:13,276 --> 0:13:13,646
impact.

330
00:13:14,116 --> 0:13:17,966
After all, TV, it has unique

331
00:13:18,176 --> 0:13:18,816
abilities.

332
00:13:19,966 --> 0:13:23,246
It has the ability to alter our

333
00:13:23,246 --> 0:13:23,746
perspective.

334
00:13:23,746 --> 0:13:27,936
It has the ability to transport

335
00:13:27,936 --> 0:13:29,916
us to a different world.

336
00:13:30,966 --> 0:13:34,506
And it has the ability to open

337
00:13:34,506 --> 0:13:36,946
our eyes to big ideas.

338
00:13:37,816 --> 0:13:42,556
And that's the goal, isn't it?

339
00:13:42,786 --> 0:13:45,426
To connect people to stories

340
00:13:45,426 --> 0:13:47,296
that change them.

341
00:13:48,286 --> 0:13:50,576
So our job as developers or

342
00:13:50,576 --> 0:13:52,196
designers, it's not to make

343
00:13:52,196 --> 0:13:53,986
people wait in frustration, no,

344
00:13:53,986 --> 0:13:56,476
it's to throw open the doors,

345
00:13:56,706 --> 0:13:58,956
let them in, and let the content

346
00:13:59,256 --> 0:13:59,986
shine.

347
00:14:01,366 --> 0:14:05,176
Because if we can do that, then

348
00:14:05,176 --> 0:14:07,886
people are more likely to stay

349
00:14:08,726 --> 0:14:11,856
and browse, watch something else

350
00:14:12,266 --> 0:14:14,206
and enjoy it.

351
00:14:15,496 --> 0:14:20,116
And that, that will lead to a

352
00:14:20,116 --> 0:14:23,396
lasting emotional connection to

353
00:14:23,396 --> 0:14:24,606
your product.

354
00:14:26,356 --> 0:14:28,956
Next up, Caleb will talk to you

355
00:14:28,956 --> 0:14:30,936
about how to take advantage of

356
00:14:30,936 --> 0:14:32,726
the content first experience in

357
00:14:32,726 --> 0:14:34,126
your own applications.

358
00:14:34,866 --> 0:14:35,236
Caleb.

359
00:14:36,516 --> 0:14:42,136
[ Applause ]

360
00:14:42,636 --> 0:14:43,166
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Tommy.

361
00:14:43,326 --> 0:14:45,556
My name is Caleb.

362
00:14:45,556 --> 0:14:47,096
I'm a software engineer on the

363
00:14:47,166 --> 0:14:48,026
Apple TV team.

364
00:14:49,186 --> 0:14:50,666
Today, I'm really excited to

365
00:14:50,666 --> 0:14:51,826
share with you some great

366
00:14:51,826 --> 0:14:53,856
enhancements we've made to Top

367
00:14:53,856 --> 0:14:56,026
Shelf in tvOS 13.

368
00:15:00,016 --> 0:15:02,066
Top Shelf is the first thing a

369
00:15:02,066 --> 0:15:03,486
person sees when they wake up an

370
00:15:03,486 --> 0:15:04,086
Apple TV.

371
00:15:04,676 --> 0:15:06,866
It gives them an easy way to

372
00:15:06,866 --> 0:15:08,706
browse content from your apps

373
00:15:09,486 --> 0:15:11,896
and offers a simple interaction

374
00:15:11,896 --> 0:15:13,176
where they can jump directly

375
00:15:13,536 --> 0:15:14,196
into playback.

376
00:15:17,936 --> 0:15:19,806
This year, we wanted to update

377
00:15:19,806 --> 0:15:21,806
Top Shelf to take full advantage

378
00:15:22,116 --> 0:15:24,796
of the biggest screen in your

379
00:15:25,516 --> 0:15:27,316
house, and provide that

380
00:15:27,316 --> 0:15:28,826
captivating browse experience

381
00:15:29,346 --> 0:15:30,336
that Tommy mentioned earlier.

382
00:15:31,676 --> 0:15:33,096
I'm happy to share with you that

383
00:15:33,096 --> 0:15:34,696
this year in tvOS 13, we're

384
00:15:34,696 --> 0:15:37,256
doing that with the Carousel.

385
00:15:37,876 --> 0:15:42,436
The Carousel had two important

386
00:15:42,436 --> 0:15:43,946
features to Top Shelf.

387
00:15:44,866 --> 0:15:46,336
First, it's immersive.

388
00:15:47,176 --> 0:15:48,926
Full screen image and video

389
00:15:48,926 --> 0:15:51,116
content from your apps plays

390
00:15:51,156 --> 0:15:52,276
right on the home screen of

391
00:15:52,276 --> 0:15:52,856
Apple TV.

392
00:15:55,436 --> 0:15:56,796
When you swipe up to enter full

393
00:15:56,796 --> 0:15:58,666
screen mode, our UI gets out of

394
00:15:58,666 --> 0:16:00,756
the way, so you can lean back

395
00:15:58,666 --> 0:16:00,756
the way, so you can lean back

396
00:16:01,226 --> 0:16:02,716
and see what's on.

397
00:16:05,936 --> 0:16:07,116
The Carousel is also

398
00:16:07,116 --> 0:16:07,786
interactive.

399
00:16:08,456 --> 0:16:10,546
Swiping between apps and between

400
00:16:10,546 --> 0:16:12,656
items feels like channel

401
00:16:12,656 --> 0:16:13,166
surfing.

402
00:16:15,076 --> 0:16:17,316
When you select an item, you can

403
00:16:17,376 --> 0:16:18,676
see this rich meta-data you see

404
00:16:18,676 --> 0:16:19,266
here at the bottom of the

405
00:16:19,266 --> 0:16:19,686
screen.

406
00:16:19,686 --> 0:16:22,156
We think this is the great way

407
00:16:22,156 --> 0:16:23,426
for you to showcase the awesome

408
00:16:23,426 --> 0:16:24,806
content you have inside your

409
00:16:24,806 --> 0:16:27,436
apps right on the home screen of

410
00:16:27,436 --> 0:16:28,036
Apple TV.

411
00:16:28,646 --> 0:16:32,736
Now, I know that not all content

412
00:16:32,736 --> 0:16:35,486
is the same and one UI style may

413
00:16:35,486 --> 0:16:36,876
not work equally well for

414
00:16:36,876 --> 0:16:37,366
everyone.

415
00:16:38,486 --> 0:16:40,946
So we have two styles available

416
00:16:40,946 --> 0:16:42,606
for you in our API.

417
00:16:44,066 --> 0:16:47,056
First is the Actions Carousel.

418
00:16:51,176 --> 0:16:53,266
The Actions Carousel focuses

419
00:16:53,266 --> 0:16:54,746
primarily on that full screen

420
00:16:54,746 --> 0:16:56,106
image of video content provided

421
00:16:56,106 --> 0:16:58,136
by your apps, and offers only a

422
00:16:58,136 --> 0:17:00,316
small number of UI elements for

423
00:16:58,136 --> 0:17:00,316
small number of UI elements for

424
00:17:00,316 --> 0:17:01,156
you to customize.

425
00:17:02,306 --> 0:17:04,356
Starting in the top-left corner,

426
00:17:05,076 --> 0:17:07,156
we have the title and context

427
00:17:07,156 --> 0:17:07,455
title.

428
00:17:08,736 --> 0:17:10,435
These tell someone viewing your

429
00:17:10,435 --> 0:17:11,976
Top Shelf content what they're

430
00:17:11,976 --> 0:17:13,906
looking and why you're showing

431
00:17:13,906 --> 0:17:14,356
it to them.

432
00:17:14,935 --> 0:17:17,465
You can think of the context

433
00:17:17,465 --> 0:17:18,636
title like you would a section

434
00:17:18,636 --> 0:17:18,996
header.

435
00:17:19,816 --> 0:17:21,066
It adds a logical grouping

436
00:17:21,306 --> 0:17:23,165
between items in your Top Shelf.

437
00:17:23,876 --> 0:17:28,156
And next we have the Play and

438
00:17:28,156 --> 0:17:29,236
More Info buttons.

439
00:17:30,366 --> 0:17:31,476
These buttons gives someone

440
00:17:31,476 --> 0:17:33,066
viewing your content an explicit

441
00:17:33,066 --> 0:17:35,066
way to jump directly to this

442
00:17:35,066 --> 0:17:38,086
item inside your application and

443
00:17:38,086 --> 0:17:40,346
either start playback right away

444
00:17:40,946 --> 0:17:42,966
or learn more about it.

445
00:17:45,056 --> 0:17:46,626
The second style we have for you

446
00:17:47,106 --> 0:17:48,846
is called the Details Carousel.

447
00:17:49,426 --> 0:17:53,616
And it looks like this.

448
00:17:53,776 --> 0:17:54,796
You'll see some familiar UI

449
00:17:54,796 --> 0:17:57,286
elements, top-left corner, our

450
00:17:57,286 --> 0:17:59,376
title and context title, in the

451
00:17:59,376 --> 0:18:00,606
bottom-left are the Play and

452
00:17:59,376 --> 0:18:00,606
bottom-left are the Play and

453
00:18:00,606 --> 0:18:01,546
More Info buttons.

454
00:18:02,266 --> 0:18:03,856
But our API also allows you to

455
00:18:03,856 --> 0:18:05,486
provide this rich meta-data you

456
00:18:05,486 --> 0:18:06,396
see highlighted here.

457
00:18:07,346 --> 0:18:10,426
Fields like summary, genre,

458
00:18:11,376 --> 0:18:14,626
duration, or even a rich set of

459
00:18:14,626 --> 0:18:16,206
media options to tell someone

460
00:18:16,426 --> 0:18:17,716
what the content will look like

461
00:18:17,716 --> 0:18:18,946
when they play it back on their

462
00:18:19,036 --> 0:18:19,556
TV.

463
00:18:19,556 --> 0:18:23,626
It does support 4K HDR or maybe

464
00:18:23,626 --> 0:18:24,766
more importantly for someone

465
00:18:24,766 --> 0:18:25,796
who's hearing impaired, this

466
00:18:25,796 --> 0:18:27,376
does support close captions or

467
00:18:27,376 --> 0:18:28,396
audio descriptions.

468
00:18:28,806 --> 0:18:32,856
And on the far right, we have a

469
00:18:32,856 --> 0:18:34,346
list of named attributes.

470
00:18:35,366 --> 0:18:36,726
This is key value data that your

471
00:18:36,726 --> 0:18:38,226
application has full control

472
00:18:38,226 --> 0:18:38,626
over.

473
00:18:38,626 --> 0:18:41,396
In this example, we have a list

474
00:18:41,396 --> 0:18:42,936
of featured actors in the

475
00:18:42,936 --> 0:18:44,506
Starring section and the

476
00:18:44,506 --> 0:18:46,296
director of the movie in the

477
00:18:46,296 --> 0:18:47,266
Director section.

478
00:18:48,146 --> 0:18:49,146
And it's really important to

479
00:18:49,146 --> 0:18:50,606
remember that when you populate

480
00:18:50,606 --> 0:18:53,246
these fields, you localize and

481
00:18:53,306 --> 0:18:54,806
pluralize them for the amount of

482
00:18:54,806 --> 0:18:56,146
content you intend to display.

483
00:18:56,786 --> 0:19:00,076
So that's the new Carousel.

484
00:18:56,786 --> 0:19:00,076
So that's the new Carousel.

485
00:19:00,666 --> 0:19:03,616
And when you adopt it, we have

486
00:19:03,616 --> 0:19:05,206
some best practices we like you

487
00:19:05,206 --> 0:19:06,626
to keep in mind.

488
00:19:08,956 --> 0:19:10,726
The Carousel is best used for

489
00:19:10,726 --> 0:19:11,816
content discovery.

490
00:19:12,716 --> 0:19:13,826
Some good examples of that might

491
00:19:13,826 --> 0:19:16,586
be a featured movie, a new

492
00:19:16,586 --> 0:19:18,706
season of a TV show, or

493
00:19:18,706 --> 0:19:20,646
personalized recommendations for

494
00:19:20,646 --> 0:19:21,596
the signed in user.

495
00:19:22,136 --> 0:19:26,606
It should also be updated

496
00:19:26,606 --> 0:19:27,276
regularly.

497
00:19:27,636 --> 0:19:28,956
This is an opportunity for you

498
00:19:28,956 --> 0:19:30,736
to showcase content in the Top

499
00:19:30,736 --> 0:19:33,216
Shelf to draw someone into your

500
00:19:33,216 --> 0:19:33,976
application.

501
00:19:34,236 --> 0:19:36,896
So it needs to be fresh and feel

502
00:19:37,726 --> 0:19:37,906
alive.

503
00:19:40,426 --> 0:19:42,456
And like Tommy said, we don't

504
00:19:42,456 --> 0:19:43,526
want to overwhelm the user with

505
00:19:43,526 --> 0:19:44,276
too much choice.

506
00:19:45,126 --> 0:19:46,706
Too many items in the Top Shelf

507
00:19:46,866 --> 0:19:48,166
just adds noise and clutter.

508
00:19:48,726 --> 0:19:49,716
So we think a good number to

509
00:19:49,716 --> 0:19:50,756
keep in mind is somewhere

510
00:19:50,756 --> 0:19:55,376
between 5 and 10.

511
00:19:55,586 --> 0:19:56,936
Next, images.

512
00:19:58,066 --> 0:19:59,796
Like I said, content in the Top

513
00:19:59,796 --> 0:20:01,616
Shelf Carousel is full screen.

514
00:19:59,796 --> 0:20:01,616
Shelf Carousel is full screen.

515
00:20:02,306 --> 0:20:04,336
So your images should be 1920 by

516
00:20:04,336 --> 0:20:06,126
1080 points and they should draw

517
00:20:06,126 --> 0:20:09,666
in the entire frame of that

518
00:20:10,756 --> 0:20:11,386
content.

519
00:20:11,866 --> 0:20:13,066
And our API allows you to

520
00:20:13,066 --> 0:20:15,156
specify images in both 1x

521
00:20:15,156 --> 0:20:17,856
resolution for 1080p devices and

522
00:20:17,956 --> 0:20:20,146
2x resolution for 4K devices.

523
00:20:20,606 --> 0:20:22,906
This is a great way for you to

524
00:20:22,906 --> 0:20:24,726
help us optimize your content

525
00:20:24,806 --> 0:20:27,096
for the best user experience in

526
00:20:27,096 --> 0:20:27,736
Top Shelf.

527
00:20:28,256 --> 0:20:31,996
And now, safe areas.

528
00:20:33,276 --> 0:20:34,446
The standard application safe

529
00:20:34,446 --> 0:20:36,406
area on tvOS looks like this.

530
00:20:36,476 --> 0:20:39,196
You have 90 points of padding on

531
00:20:39,196 --> 0:20:40,176
the leading and trailing edges

532
00:20:40,176 --> 0:20:42,176
of your screen and 60 points of

533
00:20:42,176 --> 0:20:44,146
padding on the top and bottom

534
00:20:44,146 --> 0:20:44,586
edges.

535
00:20:45,076 --> 0:20:46,586
And remember, it's OK for your

536
00:20:46,586 --> 0:20:48,086
content to go outside that Safe

537
00:20:48,086 --> 0:20:50,456
Area, but based on the device or

538
00:20:50,456 --> 0:20:52,506
TV settings, the user may not be

539
00:20:52,506 --> 0:20:53,986
able to see it or interact with

540
00:20:53,986 --> 0:20:54,166
it.

541
00:20:54,226 --> 0:20:57,396
We have a similar safe area for

542
00:20:57,396 --> 0:20:58,076
the Carousel.

543
00:20:58,076 --> 0:21:00,326
When you put your images in the

544
00:20:58,076 --> 0:21:00,326
When you put your images in the

545
00:21:00,326 --> 0:21:01,726
Carousel, remember that they

546
00:21:01,726 --> 0:21:03,836
might show under system UI like

547
00:21:03,956 --> 0:21:06,426
the chevrons, the details UI in

548
00:21:06,426 --> 0:21:08,606
the bottom or even the app grid.

549
00:21:09,356 --> 0:21:10,556
So, if you have things like

550
00:21:10,556 --> 0:21:12,586
title art in your images, make

551
00:21:12,586 --> 0:21:13,536
sure they don't conflict with

552
00:21:13,536 --> 0:21:14,856
that system UI and make it hard

553
00:21:14,856 --> 0:21:15,826
to see or use.

554
00:21:16,396 --> 0:21:20,826
And last, videos.

555
00:21:21,856 --> 0:21:23,656
Like Tommy showed, you can play

556
00:21:23,656 --> 0:21:25,286
videos, trailers for your

557
00:21:25,286 --> 0:21:27,346
content in Top Shelf Carousel.

558
00:21:28,056 --> 0:21:30,156
Those video should be 1080p high

559
00:21:30,156 --> 0:21:30,816
definition.

560
00:21:31,856 --> 0:21:34,466
And if possible, you should

561
00:21:34,466 --> 0:21:36,776
deliver them to us using HTTP

562
00:21:36,776 --> 0:21:38,666
Live Streaming or HLS.

563
00:21:39,916 --> 0:21:41,296
This is another way for you to

564
00:21:41,296 --> 0:21:43,166
help us optimize your content

565
00:21:43,296 --> 0:21:44,756
for the best user experience in

566
00:21:44,756 --> 0:21:45,276
Top Shelf.

567
00:21:46,056 --> 0:21:47,166
Those videos should be fast to

568
00:21:47,166 --> 0:21:48,866
load and we should be able to

569
00:21:48,866 --> 0:21:50,286
optimize them for the users'

570
00:21:50,286 --> 0:21:51,246
available bandwidth.

571
00:21:54,576 --> 0:21:56,266
And like I mentioned earlier,

572
00:21:56,356 --> 0:21:57,456
the Carousel is a great place

573
00:21:57,456 --> 0:21:59,206
for you to preview your content.

574
00:21:59,796 --> 0:22:01,056
We don't want you offering a

575
00:21:59,796 --> 0:22:01,056
We don't want you offering a

576
00:22:01,056 --> 0:22:02,816
full-length viewing experience

577
00:22:03,116 --> 0:22:03,966
in the Carousel.

578
00:22:05,656 --> 0:22:07,156
So we think an appropriate

579
00:22:07,156 --> 0:22:08,666
amount of time for your videos

580
00:22:08,666 --> 0:22:10,236
is around 2 to 5 minutes.

581
00:22:10,796 --> 0:22:14,296
And we encourage you to include

582
00:22:14,296 --> 0:22:15,966
audio in your videos.

583
00:22:16,076 --> 0:22:17,536
We will make sure the audio only

584
00:22:17,536 --> 0:22:19,376
plays at the appropriate time.

585
00:22:19,956 --> 0:22:21,966
That means on explicit user

586
00:22:21,966 --> 0:22:22,426
action.

587
00:22:26,036 --> 0:22:27,926
So now, we have four UI styles

588
00:22:27,926 --> 0:22:30,166
available for you in Top Shelf,

589
00:22:30,296 --> 0:22:32,986
starting with Carousel Actions,

590
00:22:34,696 --> 0:22:38,166
the Details Carousel, and

591
00:22:38,646 --> 0:22:41,886
Sectioned, and Inset Content.

592
00:22:42,396 --> 0:22:45,466
And remember if your content

593
00:22:45,536 --> 0:22:47,356
doesn't work in the Carousel, if

594
00:22:47,356 --> 0:22:49,096
you don't have full screen art

595
00:22:49,096 --> 0:22:50,946
or video, that's OK.

596
00:22:51,436 --> 0:22:53,016
We still encourage you to use

597
00:22:53,016 --> 0:22:54,306
the Sectioned and Inset Content

598
00:22:54,306 --> 0:22:55,576
styles to provide that

599
00:22:55,576 --> 0:22:57,486
lightweight, easy to browse

600
00:22:57,766 --> 0:22:59,716
content experience in a Top

601
00:23:00,406 --> 0:23:00,546
Shelf.

602
00:23:02,656 --> 0:23:04,006
So that's an overview of the UI

603
00:23:04,006 --> 0:23:05,746
and a little bit about how it

604
00:23:05,746 --> 0:23:06,086
works.

605
00:23:07,046 --> 0:23:08,396
Now, let's talk about how you

606
00:23:08,396 --> 0:23:09,026
build one of these.

607
00:23:10,016 --> 0:23:11,586
You'll do that with a Top Shelf

608
00:23:11,586 --> 0:23:12,246
Extension.

609
00:23:13,426 --> 0:23:14,566
This year, we have an all new

610
00:23:14,566 --> 0:23:16,246
extension and API that makes

611
00:23:16,246 --> 0:23:18,716
adopting Top Shelf easier than

612
00:23:19,436 --> 0:23:19,566
ever.

613
00:23:19,746 --> 0:23:22,416
You'll start by adding a new Top

614
00:23:22,416 --> 0:23:24,186
Shelf Extension target to your

615
00:23:24,186 --> 0:23:25,986
application in Xcode.

616
00:23:25,986 --> 0:23:28,756
And that will grant you access

617
00:23:28,886 --> 0:23:31,056
to the Carousel as well as our

618
00:23:31,056 --> 0:23:31,626
new API.

619
00:23:33,046 --> 0:23:34,376
So now I'm going go over in

620
00:23:34,376 --> 0:23:36,136
three major parts briefly,

621
00:23:37,456 --> 0:23:38,866
starting at the top with

622
00:23:38,866 --> 0:23:40,616
TVTopShelfContentProvider.

623
00:23:41,636 --> 0:23:43,156
This is the root object of your

624
00:23:43,156 --> 0:23:45,096
extension and responsible for

625
00:23:45,096 --> 0:23:46,486
responding to system requests

626
00:23:46,486 --> 0:23:47,396
for Top Shelf data.

627
00:23:47,996 --> 0:23:50,776
Our new API makes fetching your

628
00:23:50,776 --> 0:23:51,786
content and responding

629
00:23:51,786 --> 0:23:54,296
asynchronously really easy.

630
00:23:55,696 --> 0:23:58,396
Next is TVTopShelfContent.

631
00:23:59,186 --> 0:24:00,796
This is a protocol you won't

632
00:23:59,186 --> 0:24:00,796
This is a protocol you won't

633
00:24:00,796 --> 0:24:01,766
really interact with much

634
00:24:01,766 --> 0:24:02,316
directly.

635
00:24:02,796 --> 0:24:03,986
We provide three concrete

636
00:24:03,986 --> 0:24:05,796
classes for you, one for each of

637
00:24:05,796 --> 0:24:07,256
the three major UI styles,

638
00:24:08,096 --> 0:24:10,936
Carousel, Sectioned, and Inset.

639
00:24:12,206 --> 0:24:13,516
And each of these classes has

640
00:24:13,576 --> 0:24:15,506
properties that are distinct for

641
00:24:15,506 --> 0:24:16,506
each UI style.

642
00:24:17,076 --> 0:24:19,536
And last, we have

643
00:24:19,586 --> 0:24:20,686
TVTopShelfItem.

644
00:24:22,026 --> 0:24:23,406
Similar to the content classes,

645
00:24:23,546 --> 0:24:24,826
we have different classes for

646
00:24:24,826 --> 0:24:26,246
each content style that have

647
00:24:26,386 --> 0:24:28,326
varying properties for each UI

648
00:24:28,326 --> 0:24:28,706
style.

649
00:24:29,976 --> 0:24:32,186
Carousel, Item Collection, and

650
00:24:32,186 --> 0:24:33,196
Sectioned Item for showing

651
00:24:33,196 --> 0:24:35,546
Sectioned Content, and Content

652
00:24:35,546 --> 0:24:36,846
Item has enough properties to

653
00:24:36,846 --> 0:24:38,106
show Inset Content.

654
00:24:38,606 --> 0:24:41,056
So now instead of going into any

655
00:24:41,056 --> 0:24:42,726
more code, I think it's more fun

656
00:24:42,726 --> 0:24:44,116
if we do a demo and see how this

657
00:24:44,116 --> 0:24:44,566
all works.

658
00:24:44,736 --> 0:24:45,586
So I invite my colleague,

659
00:24:45,586 --> 0:24:47,846
Felipe, to the stage and help me

660
00:24:48,646 --> 0:24:48,726
out.

661
00:24:48,996 --> 0:24:49,316
Felipe?

662
00:24:51,516 --> 0:24:54,500
[ Applause ]

663
00:24:59,416 --> 0:25:01,116
So like I said the first step

664
00:24:59,416 --> 0:25:01,116
So like I said the first step

665
00:25:01,216 --> 0:25:02,466
would be to add a new Top Shelf

666
00:25:02,466 --> 0:25:03,976
Extension target to our project

667
00:25:03,976 --> 0:25:04,636
in Xcode.

668
00:25:05,476 --> 0:25:06,646
So we'll start by adding a new

669
00:25:06,646 --> 0:25:07,036
target.

670
00:25:08,036 --> 0:25:09,576
And on the tvOS tab, we'll

671
00:25:09,576 --> 0:25:11,846
select TV Top Shelf Extension.

672
00:25:12,286 --> 0:25:16,266
We'll give it a name and make

673
00:25:16,266 --> 0:25:17,586
sure the Embed in Application

674
00:25:17,586 --> 0:25:18,896
pop-up is set to the correct

675
00:25:18,896 --> 0:25:19,236
value.

676
00:25:19,856 --> 0:25:22,296
In this case we already have an

677
00:25:22,296 --> 0:25:23,296
extension in our project with

678
00:25:23,296 --> 0:25:24,566
some supporting files, so we'll

679
00:25:24,566 --> 0:25:26,496
skip this for now and go right

680
00:25:26,496 --> 0:25:27,426
to our ContentProvider.

681
00:25:27,486 --> 0:25:30,726
This is what it will look like

682
00:25:30,726 --> 0:25:31,746
when you add a new Top Shelf

683
00:25:31,746 --> 0:25:32,846
Extension to your project.

684
00:25:33,996 --> 0:25:35,466
In the ContentProvider class,

685
00:25:35,556 --> 0:25:36,346
the subclasses,

686
00:25:36,686 --> 0:25:38,696
TVTopShelfContentProvider and

687
00:25:38,696 --> 0:25:40,516
implements loadTopShelfContent,

688
00:25:40,926 --> 0:25:42,036
it takes the completionHandler.

689
00:25:42,606 --> 0:25:44,566
Right now we're calling that

690
00:25:44,566 --> 0:25:45,886
with nil, which just means we

691
00:25:45,886 --> 0:25:46,906
don't have anything to display

692
00:25:46,906 --> 0:25:47,476
at the moment.

693
00:25:47,476 --> 0:25:48,836
So, let's replace that with some

694
00:25:48,836 --> 0:25:49,406
real content.

695
00:25:54,556 --> 0:25:56,326
Here, we're fetching a list of

696
00:25:56,326 --> 0:25:57,606
featured movies from

697
00:25:57,606 --> 0:25:59,506
MoviesClient, and it responds

698
00:25:59,566 --> 0:26:01,426
asynchronously with a result of

699
00:25:59,566 --> 0:26:01,426
asynchronously with a result of

700
00:26:01,586 --> 0:26:03,846
either a movies response or an

701
00:26:03,846 --> 0:26:04,126
error.

702
00:26:04,796 --> 0:26:05,766
So let's fill out each of those

703
00:26:05,766 --> 0:26:07,206
cases with some real content

704
00:26:07,286 --> 0:26:08,356
starting with success.

705
00:26:08,886 --> 0:26:10,676
Here, we'll call

706
00:26:10,676 --> 0:26:11,766
completionHandler with a real

707
00:26:11,766 --> 0:26:12,436
model object.

708
00:26:13,066 --> 0:26:15,136
And in the case of an error, we

709
00:26:15,136 --> 0:26:15,766
still want to call the

710
00:26:15,766 --> 0:26:17,106
completionHandler with nil to

711
00:26:17,106 --> 0:26:18,236
tell the system we don't have

712
00:26:18,236 --> 0:26:19,896
any more work to do right now.

713
00:26:21,036 --> 0:26:23,216
Great. Let's go add some

714
00:26:23,216 --> 0:26:24,486
extensions to our models that

715
00:26:24,486 --> 0:26:26,086
let us fill out that rich Top

716
00:26:26,086 --> 0:26:26,706
Shelf content.

717
00:26:27,206 --> 0:26:31,146
Here we have two extensions,

718
00:26:31,146 --> 0:26:32,996
one, on our Movie object that

719
00:26:32,996 --> 0:26:34,836
knows how to return a Top Shelf

720
00:26:35,026 --> 0:26:35,886
sectioned item.

721
00:26:36,836 --> 0:26:38,256
And one on our MoviesResponse

722
00:26:38,346 --> 0:26:39,606
that knows how to take all those

723
00:26:39,606 --> 0:26:41,226
items and bundle them into a

724
00:26:41,226 --> 0:26:42,356
sectioned content object.

725
00:26:42,866 --> 0:26:43,966
Here, it has a title called

726
00:26:43,996 --> 0:26:45,486
Featured Movies and a list of

727
00:26:45,486 --> 0:26:45,996
items.

728
00:26:46,516 --> 0:26:48,966
And our item class is kind of

729
00:26:48,966 --> 0:26:49,376
boring.

730
00:26:49,506 --> 0:26:50,746
We only have a title right now.

731
00:26:50,986 --> 0:26:52,176
So let's add some more

732
00:26:52,176 --> 0:26:55,016
properties starting with images.

733
00:26:55,576 --> 0:26:58,356
Our API, like I said, allows you

734
00:26:58,356 --> 0:27:00,116
to specify images for both 1x

735
00:26:58,356 --> 0:27:00,116
to specify images for both 1x

736
00:27:00,326 --> 0:27:02,426
and 2x screen scales.

737
00:27:02,426 --> 0:27:03,766
So here we're doing that and

738
00:27:03,766 --> 0:27:04,946
we're also setting the image

739
00:27:04,946 --> 0:27:06,886
shape to HDTV, which means we

740
00:27:06,886 --> 0:27:08,656
want 16 by 9 tiles in our

741
00:27:08,656 --> 0:27:09,606
Sectioned Top Shelf.

742
00:27:10,106 --> 0:27:12,736
Now we need to handle user

743
00:27:12,736 --> 0:27:13,416
actions.

744
00:27:13,416 --> 0:27:14,276
What happened from the user

745
00:27:14,276 --> 0:27:15,356
interacts with our item in Top

746
00:27:15,356 --> 0:27:15,736
Shelf?

747
00:27:16,496 --> 0:27:17,786
Starting with displayAction.

748
00:27:18,356 --> 0:27:19,146
This is what happens when the

749
00:27:19,146 --> 0:27:20,706
user selects your item when it's

750
00:27:20,706 --> 0:27:21,856
focused in Top Shelf.

751
00:27:22,376 --> 0:27:24,166
And playAction is what happens

752
00:27:24,166 --> 0:27:25,356
when the user presses the play

753
00:27:25,356 --> 0:27:27,196
button on the Siri Remote again

754
00:27:27,196 --> 0:27:28,166
while the item is focused.

755
00:27:28,166 --> 0:27:29,966
This will be delivered to your

756
00:27:29,966 --> 0:27:32,296
application through its open URL

757
00:27:32,296 --> 0:27:34,006
handler and it's important that

758
00:27:34,006 --> 0:27:35,526
you take them directly to this

759
00:27:35,526 --> 0:27:36,896
content as soon as possible.

760
00:27:38,386 --> 0:27:38,936
That's it.

761
00:27:39,316 --> 0:27:40,426
Let's run this and see how it

762
00:27:40,426 --> 0:27:40,726
looks.

763
00:27:49,066 --> 0:27:50,086
Fantastic.

764
00:27:50,936 --> 0:27:52,526
If you have an extension today

765
00:27:52,526 --> 0:27:54,356
that uses Top Shelf, this is

766
00:27:54,356 --> 0:27:55,276
probably what it looks like.

767
00:27:55,916 --> 0:27:56,826
We have Sectioned title.

768
00:27:56,826 --> 0:27:58,686
When we focus around, we can see

769
00:27:58,686 --> 0:27:59,906
the title of each item shows

770
00:27:59,906 --> 0:28:01,046
underneath.

771
00:27:59,906 --> 0:28:01,046
underneath.

772
00:28:01,596 --> 0:28:03,006
But we really want to use that

773
00:28:03,006 --> 0:28:05,416
new immersive browse experience

774
00:28:05,416 --> 0:28:06,156
in Top Shelf.

775
00:28:06,156 --> 0:28:08,136
So let's go back to Xcode and

776
00:28:08,136 --> 0:28:08,886
see what changes we have to

777
00:28:08,886 --> 0:28:09,116
make.

778
00:28:11,396 --> 0:28:12,756
The first thing we'll need is to

779
00:28:12,756 --> 0:28:14,136
change our makeTopShelfItem

780
00:28:14,136 --> 0:28:16,096
function to return a TV Top

781
00:28:16,096 --> 0:28:17,976
Shelf Carousel item instead.

782
00:28:25,516 --> 0:28:26,986
And right away the compiler will

783
00:28:26,986 --> 0:28:28,646
help us and tell us the image

784
00:28:28,646 --> 0:28:29,646
shape isn't really valid

785
00:28:29,646 --> 0:28:30,026
anymore.

786
00:28:30,106 --> 0:28:31,216
So let's get rid of that line.

787
00:28:31,646 --> 0:28:33,636
Now we need only to add two more

788
00:28:33,636 --> 0:28:35,066
properties to fill out the rest

789
00:28:35,066 --> 0:28:36,646
of our Carousel content.

790
00:28:37,836 --> 0:28:39,886
First is the Context Title,

791
00:28:40,096 --> 0:28:41,276
again, that Section Header that

792
00:28:41,276 --> 0:28:42,086
tells the user what we're

793
00:28:42,086 --> 0:28:42,576
looking at.

794
00:28:43,776 --> 0:28:46,166
And the previewVideoURL, that's

795
00:28:46,166 --> 0:28:47,646
what plays after we transition

796
00:28:47,646 --> 0:28:49,026
away from your image content.

797
00:28:49,536 --> 0:28:53,706
And last, we need to update our

798
00:28:53,706 --> 0:28:55,256
makeTopShelfContent function to

799
00:28:55,256 --> 0:28:55,726
return a

800
00:28:55,726 --> 0:28:57,846
TVTopShelfCarouselContent to

801
00:28:57,846 --> 0:28:58,906
match our Carousel item.

802
00:28:59,536 --> 0:29:02,126
Here, we're requesting the

803
00:28:59,536 --> 0:29:02,126
Here, we're requesting the

804
00:29:02,186 --> 0:29:03,616
Action Style Carousel.

805
00:29:07,276 --> 0:29:07,976
Great. Let's run this again.

806
00:29:19,666 --> 0:29:21,956
Awesome. Look how great that

807
00:29:21,956 --> 0:29:22,396
looks!

808
00:29:22,796 --> 0:29:24,676
We went from little Inset boxes

809
00:29:24,756 --> 0:29:27,366
of static content to this big

810
00:29:27,366 --> 0:29:28,546
full screen playing preview

811
00:29:28,546 --> 0:29:29,586
video of our content.

812
00:29:30,486 --> 0:29:31,726
When Felipe swipes up to enter

813
00:29:31,726 --> 0:29:33,206
full screen mode, our UI gets

814
00:29:33,206 --> 0:29:34,906
out of the way and he can swipe

815
00:29:34,906 --> 0:29:36,566
between items to see what else

816
00:29:36,566 --> 0:29:37,826
there is in our Top Shelf.

817
00:29:38,676 --> 0:29:40,146
When he presses menu, we'll go

818
00:29:40,146 --> 0:29:42,196
back to the up grid right where

819
00:29:42,196 --> 0:29:42,896
we left off.

820
00:29:44,276 --> 0:29:44,876
Now, let's go back to our

821
00:29:44,876 --> 0:29:45,926
project and make one more

822
00:29:45,926 --> 0:29:46,566
change.

823
00:29:47,526 --> 0:29:48,456
We want to take advantage of

824
00:29:48,456 --> 0:29:50,236
that full rich meta-data that

825
00:29:50,236 --> 0:29:51,596
Top Shelf API offers.

826
00:29:52,016 --> 0:29:53,026
So we'll add a few more

827
00:29:53,026 --> 0:29:54,566
properties to our item class.

828
00:29:55,046 --> 0:29:57,466
Like I mentioned, these are

829
00:29:57,466 --> 0:29:59,506
fields like summary, genre,

830
00:30:00,056 --> 0:30:01,906
media options.

831
00:30:02,046 --> 0:30:03,446
This just describes more

832
00:30:03,446 --> 0:30:04,836
contexts about the item we're

833
00:30:04,836 --> 0:30:06,006
looking at to our viewers.

834
00:30:07,416 --> 0:30:09,016
And last, let's update our

835
00:30:09,016 --> 0:30:10,636
content object to return a

836
00:30:10,636 --> 0:30:12,376
detail style Carousel.

837
00:30:12,926 --> 0:30:15,756
Let's run this one more time.

838
00:30:20,636 --> 0:30:21,866
So you'll notice that we only

839
00:30:21,866 --> 0:30:23,836
changed a few classes and added

840
00:30:23,836 --> 0:30:25,296
a few properties to go all the

841
00:30:25,296 --> 0:30:26,706
way from Sectioned Content to

842
00:30:26,706 --> 0:30:28,646
this dynamic, immersive browse

843
00:30:28,646 --> 0:30:29,306
experience.

844
00:30:30,266 --> 0:30:31,266
When Felipe swiped up to enter

845
00:30:31,266 --> 0:30:32,176
full screen, you'll and notice

846
00:30:32,176 --> 0:30:33,036
that we don't show that

847
00:30:33,036 --> 0:30:34,336
meta-data UI right away.

848
00:30:34,386 --> 0:30:35,206
We don't want to overwhelm the

849
00:30:35,206 --> 0:30:36,546
user with too much information

850
00:30:36,546 --> 0:30:37,266
all at once.

851
00:30:37,576 --> 0:30:39,346
So it's available on demand when

852
00:30:39,346 --> 0:30:41,096
he taps or clicks the Siri

853
00:30:41,096 --> 0:30:41,406
Remote.

854
00:30:42,756 --> 0:30:43,566
In here, you see all the

855
00:30:43,566 --> 0:30:45,046
information we filled out just a

856
00:30:45,046 --> 0:30:45,566
moment ago.

857
00:30:45,566 --> 0:30:46,936
That's it.

858
00:30:47,176 --> 0:30:49,296
That's all it takes to adopt Top

859
00:30:49,296 --> 0:30:50,846
Shelf in your apps.

860
00:30:51,056 --> 0:30:51,516
Thanks, Felipe.

[ Applause ]

862
00:30:58,196 --> 0:31:00,206
So you saw how easy that was to

863
00:30:58,196 --> 0:31:00,206
So you saw how easy that was to

864
00:31:01,516 --> 0:31:03,376
provide a great browse

865
00:31:03,376 --> 0:31:05,586
experience in Top Shelf on Apple

866
00:31:05,586 --> 0:31:06,316
TV.

867
00:31:07,436 --> 0:31:10,266
And you saw the Carousel and how

868
00:31:10,266 --> 0:31:11,876
it lets you go from a static

869
00:31:11,876 --> 0:31:15,046
inset Top Shelf content to this

870
00:31:15,046 --> 0:31:17,516
big exciting captivating browse

871
00:31:17,516 --> 0:31:18,196
experience.

872
00:31:19,186 --> 0:31:20,966
And, you saw the new extension

873
00:31:20,966 --> 0:31:22,556
and API, which makes adopting

874
00:31:22,556 --> 0:31:24,146
all of this easier than ever.

875
00:31:25,066 --> 0:31:26,406
We can't wait to see what all of

876
00:31:26,406 --> 0:31:28,376
you do with Top Shelf in tvOS

877
00:31:28,376 --> 0:31:29,016
13.

878
00:31:30,116 --> 0:31:31,076
Now, I'd like to hand it over to

879
00:31:31,076 --> 0:31:32,636
Dale to talk about bringing that

880
00:31:32,636 --> 0:31:34,546
content first design principles

881
00:31:34,866 --> 0:31:36,426
inside your application.

882
00:31:37,376 --> 0:31:37,576
Dale.

[ Applause ]

884
00:31:41,486 --> 0:31:42,656
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Caleb.

885
00:31:46,596 --> 0:31:48,016
My name is Dale Taylor and I'm

886
00:31:48,016 --> 0:31:49,336
an engineer on the tvOS team.

887
00:31:49,506 --> 0:31:50,946
I'm going to start off today by

888
00:31:50,946 --> 0:31:51,996
talking to you about User

889
00:31:51,996 --> 0:31:53,756
Profiles and how you can use

890
00:31:53,756 --> 0:31:55,016
them to show people the content

891
00:31:55,016 --> 0:31:57,446
that they really want to see.

892
00:31:58,876 --> 0:32:01,606
In tvOS 13, we're bringing

893
00:31:58,876 --> 0:32:01,606
In tvOS 13, we're bringing

894
00:32:01,606 --> 0:32:03,086
Control Center to the TV.

895
00:32:03,306 --> 0:32:04,806
It gives people quick access to

896
00:32:04,806 --> 0:32:06,666
common used actions, such as

897
00:32:06,666 --> 0:32:08,656
Sleep, Search, and Now Playing.

898
00:32:09,026 --> 0:32:10,266
Additionally, we've added user

899
00:32:10,266 --> 0:32:11,446
switching right up at the top.

900
00:32:12,366 --> 0:32:14,026
This gives people a lightweight

901
00:32:14,026 --> 0:32:15,456
way to quickly switch to their

902
00:32:15,456 --> 0:32:16,496
personalized content and

903
00:32:16,496 --> 0:32:18,326
recommendations all without

904
00:32:18,326 --> 0:32:19,186
losing context.

905
00:32:19,976 --> 0:32:20,756
We're opening up this

906
00:32:20,756 --> 0:32:22,536
functionality to developers so

907
00:32:22,536 --> 0:32:23,756
you too can take advantage of

908
00:32:23,756 --> 0:32:24,926
multiuser in your apps.

909
00:32:25,296 --> 0:32:26,526
Let me show you what this looks

910
00:32:26,526 --> 0:32:26,766
like.

911
00:32:27,036 --> 0:32:27,966
I'll start with an example.

912
00:32:29,636 --> 0:32:31,916
How many of you had sat down to

913
00:32:31,916 --> 0:32:33,966
watch TV only to be presented

914
00:32:33,966 --> 0:32:34,786
with something that looks like

915
00:32:34,786 --> 0:32:35,246
this?

916
00:32:35,786 --> 0:32:37,106
Well, we want to make that a

917
00:32:37,106 --> 0:32:37,856
thing of the past.

918
00:32:38,586 --> 0:32:39,906
While we're glad that your apps

919
00:32:39,906 --> 0:32:41,226
are providing great personalized

920
00:32:41,226 --> 0:32:43,496
recommendations, ultimately, a

921
00:32:43,496 --> 0:32:45,586
screen like this isn't a content

922
00:32:45,626 --> 0:32:46,596
first experience.

923
00:32:47,066 --> 0:32:48,516
It can be especially frustrating

924
00:32:48,516 --> 0:32:50,896
because in tvOS 13, the Apple TV

925
00:32:50,896 --> 0:32:51,856
already knows who you are.

926
00:32:52,206 --> 0:32:53,956
So why is it asking again?

927
00:32:54,956 --> 0:32:55,906
Let's take a look at what we're

928
00:32:55,906 --> 0:32:56,606
doing to help you.

929
00:32:57,196 --> 0:33:00,346
We have new API and TV services

930
00:32:57,196 --> 0:33:00,346
We have new API and TV services

931
00:33:00,346 --> 0:33:03,376
in tvOS 13, TVUserManager to

932
00:33:03,376 --> 0:33:04,746
help your profile-based apps

933
00:33:04,806 --> 0:33:05,896
integrate with multiuser.

934
00:33:06,666 --> 0:33:07,776
We do a few things for you.

935
00:33:08,566 --> 0:33:10,456
We supply you an identifier that

936
00:33:10,456 --> 0:33:11,866
represents the current user on

937
00:33:11,866 --> 0:33:13,626
the TV, and we'll let you know

938
00:33:13,626 --> 0:33:14,806
when that identifier changes.

939
00:33:15,536 --> 0:33:16,806
This is important because with

940
00:33:16,806 --> 0:33:18,476
Control Center, that can happen

941
00:33:18,526 --> 0:33:19,416
even when your apps in the

942
00:33:19,496 --> 0:33:19,996
foreground.

943
00:33:20,856 --> 0:33:22,596
We even supply you some system

944
00:33:22,596 --> 0:33:24,376
UI to help people using your app

945
00:33:24,446 --> 0:33:26,266
map between our user identifiers

946
00:33:26,616 --> 0:33:27,916
and your app's profiles.

947
00:33:29,546 --> 0:33:30,586
So what do you have to do to

948
00:33:30,586 --> 0:33:31,916
integrate with TVUserManager?

949
00:33:33,326 --> 0:33:35,306
Most importantly, you're

950
00:33:35,306 --> 0:33:36,776
responsible for mapping between

951
00:33:36,776 --> 0:33:38,516
a user identifier and a profile

952
00:33:38,516 --> 0:33:39,666
in your app.

953
00:33:39,666 --> 0:33:40,956
Generally, you would want to

954
00:33:40,956 --> 0:33:41,776
store this in your user

955
00:33:41,776 --> 0:33:43,416
defaults, mapping each user

956
00:33:43,416 --> 0:33:45,016
identifier to a profile.

957
00:33:45,626 --> 0:33:46,886
It's perfectly acceptable to

958
00:33:46,886 --> 0:33:48,406
have multiple user identifiers

959
00:33:48,406 --> 0:33:49,686
map to a single profile.

960
00:33:50,296 --> 0:33:52,306
What this means is that you can

961
00:33:52,306 --> 0:33:54,036
have multiple users on a TV and

962
00:33:54,036 --> 0:33:55,256
they can share the same profile

963
00:33:55,256 --> 0:33:56,996
in an app.

964
00:33:56,996 --> 0:33:58,426
And these user identifiers will

965
00:33:58,426 --> 0:33:59,766
be unique for every developer

966
00:33:59,766 --> 0:34:00,066
team.

967
00:33:59,766 --> 0:34:00,066
team.

968
00:34:00,436 --> 0:34:02,216
So if you have multiple apps or

969
00:34:02,216 --> 0:34:03,786
extensions in your suite, you

970
00:34:03,786 --> 0:34:04,516
can all share the same

971
00:34:04,516 --> 0:34:05,166
preferences.

972
00:34:06,576 --> 0:34:07,566
You're also responsible for

973
00:34:07,566 --> 0:34:08,795
listening for changes in the

974
00:34:08,795 --> 0:34:09,926
current user identifier.

975
00:34:09,926 --> 0:34:11,735
I'll get into some best

976
00:34:11,735 --> 0:34:14,085
practices on how to handle that

977
00:34:14,696 --> 0:34:14,835
later.

978
00:34:15,085 --> 0:34:16,346
It's also up to your apps to

979
00:34:16,346 --> 0:34:17,636
call the methods you have to

980
00:34:17,636 --> 0:34:19,146
present system UI in a way that

981
00:34:19,146 --> 0:34:20,166
makes sense for your app's

982
00:34:20,166 --> 0:34:20,676
workflow.

983
00:34:21,295 --> 0:34:22,606
But everyone's app is a little

984
00:34:22,606 --> 0:34:22,956
different.

985
00:34:23,025 --> 0:34:24,186
So let's take a look at an

986
00:34:24,186 --> 0:34:24,626
example.

987
00:34:25,656 --> 0:34:27,295
Imagine your app puts up a

988
00:34:27,295 --> 0:34:28,706
profile picker just like the one

989
00:34:28,706 --> 0:34:29,616
I showed you before when it

990
00:34:29,616 --> 0:34:29,956
launches.

991
00:34:31,176 --> 0:34:33,826
Well, here's what you do, before

992
00:34:33,826 --> 0:34:35,235
you even put up your profile

993
00:34:35,235 --> 0:34:36,606
picker, you check to see if your

994
00:34:36,606 --> 0:34:38,166
app has a profile associated

995
00:34:38,166 --> 0:34:38,835
with the current user

996
00:34:38,835 --> 0:34:39,426
identifier.

997
00:34:39,755 --> 0:34:41,496
If it does, you can provide

998
00:34:41,496 --> 0:34:42,735
people with the absolute best

999
00:34:42,735 --> 0:34:43,406
experience.

1000
00:34:44,485 --> 0:34:45,936
You can just let them watch TV.

1001
00:34:46,516 --> 0:34:47,426
You don't have to ask them any

1002
00:34:47,426 --> 0:34:48,036
questions.

1003
00:34:48,176 --> 0:34:48,985
You don't have to show them any

1004
00:34:48,985 --> 0:34:49,746
selection screens.

1005
00:34:49,746 --> 0:34:51,166
You can just bring them right to

1006
00:34:51,166 --> 0:34:51,716
their content.

1007
00:34:52,275 --> 0:34:54,646
If you don't have a profile

1008
00:34:54,646 --> 0:34:55,585
saved for the current user

1009
00:34:55,585 --> 0:34:57,296
identifier, now is when you put

1010
00:34:57,296 --> 0:34:58,446
up your app's profile picker.

1011
00:34:59,226 --> 0:35:00,326
But when someone makes a

1012
00:34:59,226 --> 0:35:00,326
But when someone makes a

1013
00:35:00,326 --> 0:35:02,006
selection, you can ask them if

1014
00:35:02,046 --> 0:35:03,276
this is the right profile for

1015
00:35:03,276 --> 0:35:04,666
the current user with this

1016
00:35:04,666 --> 0:35:05,176
dialogue.

1017
00:35:06,236 --> 0:35:07,866
This is the UI that will put up

1018
00:35:07,986 --> 0:35:09,566
asking the person using your app

1019
00:35:09,566 --> 0:35:10,566
if they want to associate the

1020
00:35:10,566 --> 0:35:12,146
current user identifier with the

1021
00:35:12,146 --> 0:35:13,416
profile that was just selected.

1022
00:35:14,146 --> 0:35:15,626
If they say yes and you save the

1023
00:35:15,626 --> 0:35:16,966
result, they won't have to be

1024
00:35:16,966 --> 0:35:18,046
asked the next time.

1025
00:35:18,146 --> 0:35:19,176
So they can have the best

1026
00:35:19,526 --> 0:35:20,636
experience when they launch the

1027
00:35:20,636 --> 0:35:21,426
app the next time.

1028
00:35:22,276 --> 0:35:23,516
So how do you put this UI on

1029
00:35:23,516 --> 0:35:23,936
screen?

1030
00:35:24,736 --> 0:35:25,106
It's easy.

1031
00:35:25,106 --> 0:35:26,556
You can do that with

1032
00:35:26,556 --> 0:35:27,386
shouldStorePreference

1033
00:35:27,386 --> 0:35:28,106
ForCurrentUser.

1034
00:35:29,356 --> 0:35:31,096
And you can also let people

1035
00:35:31,096 --> 0:35:32,516
modify these mappings after the

1036
00:35:32,556 --> 0:35:33,676
fact with the Preference Panel.

1037
00:35:34,316 --> 0:35:35,236
You can present that with

1038
00:35:35,336 --> 0:35:36,706
presentProfilePreferencePanel.

1039
00:35:37,006 --> 0:35:38,446
That UI looks like this.

1040
00:35:39,406 --> 0:35:40,586
In this dialogue, you provide

1041
00:35:40,586 --> 0:35:42,176
the current mapping between user

1042
00:35:42,176 --> 0:35:44,346
identifiers and profiles, and

1043
00:35:44,346 --> 0:35:45,716
we'll give you back the changes.

1044
00:35:46,296 --> 0:35:47,806
For both this UI and the

1045
00:35:47,806 --> 0:35:49,426
confirmation dialogue, you

1046
00:35:49,426 --> 0:35:51,676
provide usernames and user

1047
00:35:51,676 --> 0:35:53,206
identifiers and we'll supply the

1048
00:35:53,206 --> 0:35:56,126
real user names in the UI.

1049
00:35:56,406 --> 0:35:57,816
So, like I mentioned before,

1050
00:35:57,816 --> 0:35:58,556
your app should be able to

1051
00:35:58,556 --> 0:35:59,756
handle updates in the current

1052
00:35:59,756 --> 0:36:00,536
user identifier.

1053
00:35:59,756 --> 0:36:00,536
user identifier.

1054
00:36:01,576 --> 0:36:02,606
You listen for changes in the

1055
00:36:02,606 --> 0:36:03,886
current user identifier with the

1056
00:36:03,886 --> 0:36:04,976
currentUserIdentifier

1057
00:36:04,976 --> 0:36:06,146
DidChangeNotification.

1058
00:36:06,936 --> 0:36:08,486
And when this happens, you're

1059
00:36:08,486 --> 0:36:09,586
responsible for letting us know

1060
00:36:09,586 --> 0:36:11,486
the new mapping by setting user

1061
00:36:11,486 --> 0:36:13,126
identifiers for current profile.

1062
00:36:13,516 --> 0:36:15,886
Since there can be multiple user

1063
00:36:15,886 --> 0:36:17,256
identifiers pointing to the same

1064
00:36:17,256 --> 0:36:18,816
profile, you may set multiple

1065
00:36:18,816 --> 0:36:19,406
values here.

1066
00:36:19,896 --> 0:36:21,216
So that's one thing you should

1067
00:36:21,216 --> 0:36:22,246
do when the user identifier

1068
00:36:22,246 --> 0:36:22,716
changes.

1069
00:36:22,976 --> 0:36:24,706
What else?

1070
00:36:24,786 --> 0:36:25,736
Well, we have some best

1071
00:36:25,736 --> 0:36:27,416
practices that we recommend for

1072
00:36:27,416 --> 0:36:28,496
dealing with profiles in your

1073
00:36:29,476 --> 0:36:29,576
apps.

1074
00:36:30,506 --> 0:36:31,686
If you have to change the

1075
00:36:31,686 --> 0:36:33,346
profile and the previous profile

1076
00:36:33,346 --> 0:36:35,506
had ongoing activity, save it

1077
00:36:35,566 --> 0:36:36,666
because no one wants to lose

1078
00:36:36,666 --> 0:36:37,166
what they're doing.

1079
00:36:37,986 --> 0:36:39,786
And you should also make sure

1080
00:36:39,786 --> 0:36:41,426
that the change is meaningful.

1081
00:36:41,426 --> 0:36:43,046
So if-- You should be showing

1082
00:36:43,046 --> 0:36:43,926
things like personalized

1083
00:36:43,926 --> 0:36:45,856
recommendations, and make the

1084
00:36:45,856 --> 0:36:46,536
change clear.

1085
00:36:46,906 --> 0:36:48,296
So have it have a smooth

1086
00:36:48,296 --> 0:36:50,146
transition and that will make it

1087
00:36:50,146 --> 0:36:51,756
clear to people that the change

1088
00:36:51,756 --> 0:36:52,346
was successful.

1089
00:36:55,276 --> 0:36:57,216
So what do we learn about user

1090
00:36:57,216 --> 0:36:58,426
profiles today on tvOS?

1091
00:36:58,946 --> 0:36:59,916
We learned that if you have a

1092
00:36:59,916 --> 0:37:01,616
profile-based app, you can take

1093
00:36:59,916 --> 0:37:01,616
profile-based app, you can take

1094
00:37:01,616 --> 0:37:03,026
advantage of multiuser to get

1095
00:37:03,026 --> 0:37:04,666
people better personalization.

1096
00:37:05,256 --> 0:37:07,886
And you can use TVUserManager to

1097
00:37:07,886 --> 0:37:08,886
launch your app to a content

1098
00:37:08,956 --> 0:37:10,516
first experience, where people

1099
00:37:10,516 --> 0:37:12,116
can skip unnecessary dialogues

1100
00:37:12,356 --> 0:37:13,716
and go straight to watching TV.

1101
00:37:15,266 --> 0:37:16,146
So now that I've talked about

1102
00:37:16,146 --> 0:37:17,516
your first launch experience,

1103
00:37:18,006 --> 0:37:19,366
let's talk about what you'll see

1104
00:37:19,366 --> 0:37:20,756
next in your app, the Tab Bar.

1105
00:37:28,936 --> 0:37:30,366
With the new TV app, we

1106
00:37:30,366 --> 0:37:31,456
introduce a new Tab Bar.

1107
00:37:31,776 --> 0:37:33,346
It makes navigation easy.

1108
00:37:33,636 --> 0:37:34,956
And it really lets the content

1109
00:37:34,956 --> 0:37:35,916
behind it shine.

1110
00:37:37,816 --> 0:37:39,386
Because it moves along

1111
00:37:39,386 --> 0:37:40,446
vertically with the content

1112
00:37:40,546 --> 0:37:41,986
rather than disappearing when it

1113
00:37:41,986 --> 0:37:44,066
loses focus, it's a great way to

1114
00:37:44,066 --> 0:37:45,326
reinforce hierarchy for people

1115
00:37:45,326 --> 0:37:45,876
using an app.

1116
00:37:45,876 --> 0:37:48,286
I'm pleased to announce in tvOS

1117
00:37:48,286 --> 0:37:50,126
13, everyone gets this new Tab

1118
00:37:50,126 --> 0:37:50,936
Bar style.

1119
00:37:54,716 --> 0:37:55,796
So what do you have to do to

1120
00:37:55,796 --> 0:37:56,796
adopt the new Tab Bar?

1121
00:37:57,226 --> 0:37:59,026
In most cases nothing, but

1122
00:37:59,026 --> 0:38:00,066
sometimes you'll want to modify

1123
00:37:59,026 --> 0:38:00,066
sometimes you'll want to modify

1124
00:38:00,066 --> 0:38:01,296
the behavior and here's how.

1125
00:38:02,036 --> 0:38:03,286
If you want the Tab Bar to

1126
00:38:03,286 --> 0:38:04,666
scroll along with the content on

1127
00:38:04,666 --> 0:38:05,996
your screen, you can set the

1128
00:38:05,996 --> 0:38:07,076
tabBarObservedScrollView

1129
00:38:07,076 --> 0:38:08,686
property on your view controller

1130
00:38:08,686 --> 0:38:09,796
embedded within your Tab Bar

1131
00:38:09,796 --> 0:38:10,266
controller.

1132
00:38:10,986 --> 0:38:11,926
We generally recommend this

1133
00:38:11,926 --> 0:38:13,136
style for collection views full

1134
00:38:13,136 --> 0:38:14,066
of browsable content.

1135
00:38:14,306 --> 0:38:15,566
In fact, UI Collection View

1136
00:38:15,566 --> 0:38:16,596
Controller does this for you

1137
00:38:16,596 --> 0:38:17,266
automatically.

1138
00:38:17,766 --> 0:38:19,526
If you'd like the Tab Bar to

1139
00:38:19,526 --> 0:38:20,546
stay fixed at the top of the

1140
00:38:20,546 --> 0:38:21,746
screen, you can just leave this

1141
00:38:21,746 --> 0:38:22,636
property nil.

1142
00:38:23,716 --> 0:38:25,586
In either of these cases, you

1143
00:38:25,586 --> 0:38:26,646
should be mindful of the safe

1144
00:38:26,646 --> 0:38:26,936
area.

1145
00:38:27,256 --> 0:38:28,596
For scroll views, you'll get the

1146
00:38:28,596 --> 0:38:30,186
right behavior for free if you

1147
00:38:30,186 --> 0:38:30,596
just set the

1148
00:38:30,596 --> 0:38:32,026
contentInsetAdjustmentBehavior

1149
00:38:32,026 --> 0:38:33,116
to automatic.

1150
00:38:33,316 --> 0:38:34,446
If you're doing your own layout,

1151
00:38:34,446 --> 0:38:35,106
you can use your view

1152
00:38:35,106 --> 0:38:38,186
safeAreaLayoutGuide to help you.

1153
00:38:38,296 --> 0:38:40,096
We're also adding some new API

1154
00:38:40,096 --> 0:38:41,756
UITabBar so you can reflect your

1155
00:38:41,756 --> 0:38:42,726
branding in your apps.

1156
00:38:43,286 --> 0:38:44,846
We've added a new area to either

1157
00:38:44,846 --> 0:38:46,536
side of the Tab Bar where you

1158
00:38:46,536 --> 0:38:47,316
can place a logo.

1159
00:38:47,316 --> 0:38:48,806
This will move along with the

1160
00:38:48,806 --> 0:38:51,296
Tab Bar when it scrolls on and

1161
00:38:51,296 --> 0:38:52,416
off screen.

1162
00:38:52,586 --> 0:38:53,856
You can access these two new

1163
00:38:53,856 --> 0:38:55,346
views within your properties in

1164
00:38:55,346 --> 0:38:57,466
UITabBar, leadingAccessoryView

1165
00:38:57,466 --> 0:38:58,626
and trailingAccessoryView.

1166
00:38:59,386 --> 0:39:00,396
You shouldn't put buttons where

1167
00:38:59,386 --> 0:39:00,396
You shouldn't put buttons where

1168
00:39:00,396 --> 0:39:01,386
there are focusable items in

1169
00:39:01,386 --> 0:39:02,276
these accessory views.

1170
00:39:02,576 --> 0:39:03,376
They're really just designed for

1171
00:39:03,376 --> 0:39:04,796
static content.

1172
00:39:05,106 --> 0:39:06,436
Additionally, if you need to do

1173
00:39:06,436 --> 0:39:07,486
further customization on your

1174
00:39:07,486 --> 0:39:08,666
Tab Bar to match your branding,

1175
00:39:09,186 --> 0:39:09,996
you can do that with the new

1176
00:39:09,996 --> 0:39:11,306
standardAppearance property.

1177
00:39:11,576 --> 0:39:12,566
To hear more about

1178
00:39:12,566 --> 0:39:13,676
standardAppearance, see

1179
00:39:13,676 --> 0:39:15,756
Modernizing Your UI for iOS 13.

1180
00:39:15,946 --> 0:39:19,706
So what do we learn about Tab

1181
00:39:19,706 --> 0:39:20,796
Bars today on tvOS?

1182
00:39:21,416 --> 0:39:22,876
Well, you get a new one in tvOS

1183
00:39:22,876 --> 0:39:24,756
13, and it's really easy to

1184
00:39:24,756 --> 0:39:26,446
integrate into your app.

1185
00:39:26,686 --> 0:39:27,876
We've also made the Tab Bar more

1186
00:39:27,876 --> 0:39:28,476
flexible.

1187
00:39:28,846 --> 0:39:29,936
So you can have all the

1188
00:39:29,936 --> 0:39:31,276
convenience of using a standard

1189
00:39:31,276 --> 0:39:32,846
control, but you don't have to

1190
00:39:32,956 --> 0:39:34,136
sacrifice on your ability to

1191
00:39:34,136 --> 0:39:34,956
show off your branding.

1192
00:39:35,826 --> 0:39:37,446
So now that we've seen how

1193
00:39:37,446 --> 0:39:39,086
UITabBar makes for great top

1194
00:39:39,086 --> 0:39:40,146
level navigation in your app,

1195
00:39:40,386 --> 0:39:42,206
let's talk about browsing.

1196
00:39:43,506 --> 0:39:44,566
We have some new tools that you

1197
00:39:44,566 --> 0:39:46,206
can use to build a full screen

1198
00:39:46,206 --> 0:39:47,146
browsing experience.

1199
00:39:47,736 --> 0:39:50,236
Tommy mentioned earlier about

1200
00:39:50,236 --> 0:39:51,296
the importance of creating a

1201
00:39:51,296 --> 0:39:52,796
browse experience that feels

1202
00:39:52,796 --> 0:39:54,946
lightweight and effortless, an

1203
00:39:54,946 --> 0:39:57,256
experience that gets you

1204
00:39:57,256 --> 0:39:58,946
immersed in a captivating story

1205
00:39:59,016 --> 0:40:00,206
more quickly than ever before,

1206
00:39:59,016 --> 0:40:00,206
more quickly than ever before,

1207
00:40:00,606 --> 0:40:02,316
all without the frustration of

1208
00:40:02,316 --> 0:40:03,976
diving in and out of menus.

1209
00:40:04,676 --> 0:40:05,866
We built an experience that

1210
00:40:05,866 --> 0:40:07,256
makes the most of the television

1211
00:40:07,316 --> 0:40:09,226
in its gigantic screen, an

1212
00:40:09,226 --> 0:40:10,596
experience that's perfect for

1213
00:40:10,596 --> 0:40:11,206
your living room.

1214
00:40:12,026 --> 0:40:13,536
And using it is as simple as a

1215
00:40:13,536 --> 0:40:14,666
horizontal swipe.

1216
00:40:14,996 --> 0:40:17,156
In tvOs 13, we're introducing

1217
00:40:17,156 --> 0:40:18,756
new API to help you build an

1218
00:40:18,756 --> 0:40:19,856
experience just like the one you

1219
00:40:19,856 --> 0:40:20,456
see here.

1220
00:40:21,436 --> 0:40:22,616
We're doing that with the new

1221
00:40:22,616 --> 0:40:23,386
TVCollectionView

1222
00:40:23,386 --> 0:40:25,016
FullScreenLayout in TV UIKit.

1223
00:40:26,156 --> 0:40:27,696
It's designed to help you build

1224
00:40:27,696 --> 0:40:28,986
a collection view that fills the

1225
00:40:28,986 --> 0:40:30,656
screen edge to edge, taking

1226
00:40:30,656 --> 0:40:31,806
advantage of the largest display

1227
00:40:31,806 --> 0:40:32,406
in your house.

1228
00:40:33,376 --> 0:40:34,356
By default, it will look

1229
00:40:34,396 --> 0:40:35,796
familiar to people that used

1230
00:40:35,796 --> 0:40:37,506
tvOS already but it's highly

1231
00:40:37,506 --> 0:40:38,266
customizable.

1232
00:40:38,346 --> 0:40:39,966
So you can easily adjust it to

1233
00:40:39,966 --> 0:40:40,746
meet the goals of your

1234
00:40:40,746 --> 0:40:42,126
engineering and design teams.

1235
00:40:42,476 --> 0:40:44,076
In fact, it's so customizable

1236
00:40:44,076 --> 0:40:45,596
that the Top Shelf that Caleb

1237
00:40:45,596 --> 0:40:47,136
showed you earlier even uses

1238
00:40:47,136 --> 0:40:48,346
this exact the same layout.

1239
00:40:49,466 --> 0:40:50,636
To go along with this layout,

1240
00:40:50,636 --> 0:40:51,466
we're giving you when you a new

1241
00:40:51,466 --> 0:40:53,456
cell subclass, TVCollectionView

1242
00:40:53,456 --> 0:40:54,146
FullScreenCell.

1243
00:40:55,616 --> 0:40:57,156
It has two views that you need

1244
00:40:57,156 --> 0:40:58,476
to be aware of, the Masked

1245
00:40:58,476 --> 0:40:59,836
Background View and the Masked

1246
00:40:59,836 --> 0:41:00,366
Content View.

1247
00:40:59,836 --> 0:41:00,366
Content View.

1248
00:41:00,836 --> 0:41:02,536
When you create a custom cell,

1249
00:41:02,876 --> 0:41:03,856
these views are where you'll add

1250
00:41:03,856 --> 0:41:04,786
your content.

1251
00:41:04,786 --> 0:41:06,216
Generally, you'll add an opaque

1252
00:41:06,216 --> 0:41:07,606
image to the Masked Background

1253
00:41:07,606 --> 0:41:09,676
View and UI elements to the

1254
00:41:09,676 --> 0:41:10,376
Masked Content View.

1255
00:41:11,866 --> 0:41:12,976
Since this new Collection View

1256
00:41:12,976 --> 0:41:13,916
layout is designed to take

1257
00:41:13,916 --> 0:41:15,276
advantage of the entire screen,

1258
00:41:16,236 --> 0:41:18,156
the cell and its sub-use also

1259
00:41:18,156 --> 0:41:19,506
occupy the bounds of the display

1260
00:41:19,506 --> 0:41:22,326
in 1920 by 1080 points.

1261
00:41:22,326 --> 0:41:23,546
Before I tell you more about how

1262
00:41:23,546 --> 0:41:24,576
to customize a full screen

1263
00:41:24,576 --> 0:41:26,356
layout, I'll invite Felipe back

1264
00:41:26,356 --> 0:41:28,056
up on stage to show you how easy

1265
00:41:28,056 --> 0:41:29,026
it is to build a full screen

1266
00:41:29,026 --> 0:41:30,176
browse experience using

1267
00:41:30,176 --> 0:41:30,936
TVCollectionView

1268
00:41:30,936 --> 0:41:31,656
FullScreenLayout.

1269
00:41:36,508 --> 0:41:38,508
[ Applause ]

1270
00:41:42,916 --> 0:41:44,066
So we've started with an

1271
00:41:44,066 --> 0:41:45,236
existing app that has some

1272
00:41:45,316 --> 0:41:46,796
photos in a simple flow layout.

1273
00:41:47,166 --> 0:41:48,986
This is a good start but this

1274
00:41:48,986 --> 0:41:50,606
isn't really optimized for the

1275
00:41:50,606 --> 0:41:51,256
TV.

1276
00:41:51,616 --> 0:41:52,646
So now that we've seen all this

1277
00:41:52,646 --> 0:41:53,546
of that TVCollectionView

1278
00:41:53,546 --> 0:41:55,296
FullScreenLayout, let's go back

1279
00:41:55,296 --> 0:41:58,616
to Xcode and try adopting it.

1280
00:41:58,616 --> 0:42:00,276
We'll start by creating a new

1281
00:41:58,616 --> 0:42:00,276
We'll start by creating a new

1282
00:42:00,276 --> 0:42:01,286
fullScreenLayout.

1283
00:42:01,286 --> 0:42:04,396
And we can set that layout in

1284
00:42:04,396 --> 0:42:05,516
our Collection View replacing

1285
00:42:05,516 --> 0:42:05,976
the old one.

1286
00:42:10,856 --> 0:42:12,296
To go along with our layout,

1287
00:42:12,296 --> 0:42:12,886
we'll need a cell.

1288
00:42:12,886 --> 0:42:14,406
Luckily, we've already created

1289
00:42:14,406 --> 0:42:15,896
one and we can register it with

1290
00:42:15,896 --> 0:42:17,216
our Collection View.

1291
00:42:17,956 --> 0:42:21,036
Then we'll return an instance of

1292
00:42:21,036 --> 0:42:23,016
this cell in our cell for item

1293
00:42:23,016 --> 0:42:23,586
indexPath.

1294
00:42:24,226 --> 0:42:26,536
Now we've setup our View

1295
00:42:26,536 --> 0:42:28,106
Controller, we can go to our

1296
00:42:28,106 --> 0:42:29,486
cell and add some content to it.

1297
00:42:29,796 --> 0:42:31,876
We already have an imageView and

1298
00:42:31,876 --> 0:42:32,506
a titleLabel.

1299
00:42:32,506 --> 0:42:34,356
We can start off by adding the

1300
00:42:34,356 --> 0:42:35,276
imageView to the Masked

1301
00:42:35,276 --> 0:42:35,836
Background View.

1302
00:42:36,396 --> 0:42:40,256
And we can add our titleLabel to

1303
00:42:40,256 --> 0:42:41,126
our Masked Content View.

1304
00:42:42,266 --> 0:42:43,606
Let's give it a really big font

1305
00:42:43,606 --> 0:42:44,486
so it's easy to see on the

1306
00:42:44,486 --> 0:42:44,836
screen.

1307
00:42:44,836 --> 0:42:47,006
Now that we've got this all

1308
00:42:47,046 --> 0:42:48,666
setup, we can go give it a try.

1309
00:42:56,966 --> 0:42:57,906
That's a lot better.

1310
00:42:57,906 --> 0:42:59,076
This really fills the screen and

1311
00:42:59,076 --> 0:43:00,196
when you browse around, you can

1312
00:42:59,076 --> 0:43:00,196
when you browse around, you can

1313
00:43:00,196 --> 0:43:01,276
see the images in much better

1314
00:43:01,276 --> 0:43:01,646
detail.

1315
00:43:02,126 --> 0:43:04,166
But what would be great is if

1316
00:43:04,166 --> 0:43:05,036
when you click on the Siri

1317
00:43:05,036 --> 0:43:06,576
Remote, it filled the screen.

1318
00:43:07,126 --> 0:43:08,566
Luckily, that's easy to do.

1319
00:43:08,786 --> 0:43:09,666
We can go back to our View

1320
00:43:09,666 --> 0:43:13,516
Controller now and do that.

1321
00:43:14,076 --> 0:43:15,576
If we add didSelectItem in

1322
00:43:15,576 --> 0:43:17,716
indexPath, we can handle the

1323
00:43:17,746 --> 0:43:18,496
select action.

1324
00:43:19,016 --> 0:43:20,136
When that happens, we can set

1325
00:43:20,136 --> 0:43:21,316
the Masked Amount to zero and

1326
00:43:21,646 --> 0:43:22,786
will animate this to make it

1327
00:43:22,786 --> 0:43:23,236
look smooth.

1328
00:43:24,796 --> 0:43:25,826
Now, we can go ahead and try it

1329
00:43:25,826 --> 0:43:26,886
another time and see if that

1330
00:43:26,886 --> 0:43:27,946
does it.

1331
00:43:33,596 --> 0:43:35,616
You can see that when Felipe

1332
00:43:35,616 --> 0:43:36,986
clicks, it fills the screen edge

1333
00:43:36,986 --> 0:43:37,936
to edge which is really what

1334
00:43:37,936 --> 0:43:38,696
we're looking to do.

1335
00:43:39,046 --> 0:43:40,326
But it looks like we forgot to

1336
00:43:40,326 --> 0:43:41,066
hide the text.

1337
00:43:42,146 --> 0:43:43,536
No problem, that's an easy fix.

1338
00:43:43,536 --> 0:43:44,576
We can go back to our cell and

1339
00:43:44,576 --> 0:43:45,096
fix that now.

1340
00:43:46,706 --> 0:43:49,076
If we override apply, we can get

1341
00:43:49,076 --> 0:43:50,226
the layout attributes as they

1342
00:43:50,226 --> 0:43:50,776
change.

1343
00:43:51,716 --> 0:43:53,136
In this case, we want the

1344
00:43:53,136 --> 0:43:55,276
titleLabel to have an alpha of

1345
00:43:55,276 --> 0:43:57,506
zero when the Masked Amount is

1346
00:43:57,506 --> 0:43:57,856
zero.

1347
00:43:57,856 --> 0:43:59,646
So we can just set the opacity

1348
00:43:59,996 --> 0:44:01,136
to the same as the Masked

1349
00:43:59,996 --> 0:44:01,136
to the same as the Masked

1350
00:44:01,136 --> 0:44:01,406
Amount.

1351
00:44:01,906 --> 0:44:04,896
Let's give it one more try and

1352
00:44:04,896 --> 0:44:05,436
see how it looks.

1353
00:44:12,456 --> 0:44:13,556
That's much better.

1354
00:44:13,996 --> 0:44:14,766
Now, this is the type of

1355
00:44:14,766 --> 0:44:15,846
experience we're trying to build

1356
00:44:15,846 --> 0:44:16,466
on the TV.

1357
00:44:16,736 --> 0:44:17,956
It's really easy to interact

1358
00:44:17,956 --> 0:44:20,226
with and you can easily get lost

1359
00:44:20,226 --> 0:44:21,246
in the content when it fills the

1360
00:44:21,246 --> 0:44:21,996
screen like this.

1361
00:44:22,536 --> 0:44:23,606
Thanks, Felipe.

1362
00:44:24,516 --> 0:44:26,656
[ Applause ]

1363
00:44:27,156 --> 0:44:30,156
Now we can go back to the

1364
00:44:30,156 --> 0:44:30,696
details.

1365
00:44:31,236 --> 0:44:31,686
You remember

1366
00:44:31,686 --> 0:44:33,086
TVCollectionViewFullScreenCell

1367
00:44:33,086 --> 0:44:34,226
from before, and its two

1368
00:44:34,226 --> 0:44:35,986
sub-use, Masked Background and

1369
00:44:35,986 --> 0:44:36,806
Masked Content View.

1370
00:44:37,646 --> 0:44:38,986
In order to understand how these

1371
00:44:38,986 --> 0:44:40,596
two views work together, you'll

1372
00:44:40,596 --> 0:44:41,446
need to understand two

1373
00:44:41,446 --> 0:44:42,586
principles of the layout,

1374
00:44:42,966 --> 0:44:44,636
masking and parallax.

1375
00:44:44,806 --> 0:44:45,916
Let's start with masking.

1376
00:44:47,136 --> 0:44:48,946
The views and the cell are

1377
00:44:48,946 --> 0:44:50,176
layered on top of one another

1378
00:44:50,176 --> 0:44:52,046
and fill the whole screen.

1379
00:44:52,416 --> 0:44:53,166
You can see the Masked

1380
00:44:53,166 --> 0:44:55,296
Background View here and the

1381
00:44:55,296 --> 0:44:56,256
Content View on top.

1382
00:44:56,916 --> 0:44:58,166
When running edge to edge like

1383
00:44:58,166 --> 0:44:59,576
this, the Masked Amount

1384
00:44:59,576 --> 0:45:01,316
specified by the layout in cell

1385
00:44:59,576 --> 0:45:01,316
specified by the layout in cell

1386
00:45:01,316 --> 0:45:02,016
would be zero.

1387
00:45:03,146 --> 0:45:04,546
But when we're browsing around

1388
00:45:04,546 --> 0:45:05,996
in inset from the sides like

1389
00:45:05,996 --> 0:45:07,806
this, the Masked Amount is one.

1390
00:45:08,416 --> 0:45:11,316
You can control the amount of

1391
00:45:11,316 --> 0:45:12,556
the masked inset with the Masked

1392
00:45:12,556 --> 0:45:13,826
Inset Property in the layout.

1393
00:45:15,116 --> 0:45:16,306
The same information is

1394
00:45:16,306 --> 0:45:17,486
reflected in the cell with the

1395
00:45:17,486 --> 0:45:18,836
Content Bleed Property that it

1396
00:45:18,836 --> 0:45:20,186
gets from the layout attributes.

1397
00:45:20,826 --> 0:45:23,186
So that's masking.

1398
00:45:23,186 --> 0:45:24,396
Let's talk about parallax.

1399
00:45:25,156 --> 0:45:26,456
Parallax is just a way to create

1400
00:45:26,456 --> 0:45:27,746
depth by moving layers at

1401
00:45:27,746 --> 0:45:28,476
different rates.

1402
00:45:28,926 --> 0:45:30,346
We do this all over tvOS

1403
00:45:30,346 --> 0:45:30,736
already.

1404
00:45:30,736 --> 0:45:32,366
Let me explain how that applies

1405
00:45:32,366 --> 0:45:33,686
to our layout.

1406
00:45:34,776 --> 0:45:36,556
The layout has a Parallax Factor

1407
00:45:36,556 --> 0:45:37,046
property.

1408
00:45:37,246 --> 0:45:39,006
It specifies how much slower the

1409
00:45:39,006 --> 0:45:40,396
Masked Background View most

1410
00:45:40,396 --> 0:45:41,706
relative to the Masked Content

1411
00:45:42,246 --> 0:45:42,366
View.

1412
00:45:43,376 --> 0:45:45,426
The same information is passed

1413
00:45:45,426 --> 0:45:46,506
down to the cell through the

1414
00:45:46,506 --> 0:45:47,546
layout attributes and the

1415
00:45:47,546 --> 0:45:48,866
parallax offset property.

1416
00:45:49,506 --> 0:45:50,746
This specifies the distance

1417
00:45:50,746 --> 0:45:51,926
between the center of the Masked

1418
00:45:51,926 --> 0:45:53,296
Background and Masked Content

1419
00:45:53,296 --> 0:45:54,356
View at any point in time.

1420
00:45:55,246 --> 0:45:56,576
With different rates of motion

1421
00:45:56,576 --> 0:45:57,826
and a partially transparent

1422
00:45:57,826 --> 0:45:59,816
Masked Content View, you can see

1423
00:45:59,816 --> 0:46:00,916
how we'd be able to simulate a

1424
00:45:59,816 --> 0:46:00,916
how we'd be able to simulate a

1425
00:46:00,916 --> 0:46:02,346
sense of depth.

1426
00:46:05,156 --> 0:46:06,706
Finally, when combined together

1427
00:46:06,706 --> 0:46:08,466
with the mask, we get the wipe

1428
00:46:08,466 --> 0:46:09,746
effect that you saw on Felipe's

1429
00:46:09,746 --> 0:46:10,026
demo.

1430
00:46:10,736 --> 0:46:14,316
As a reminder, we do the heavy

1431
00:46:14,316 --> 0:46:15,156
lifting for you in

1432
00:46:15,156 --> 0:46:15,876
TVCollectionView

1433
00:46:15,876 --> 0:46:17,476
FullScreenLayout, but this

1434
00:46:17,506 --> 0:46:18,686
overview should have helped you

1435
00:46:18,686 --> 0:46:19,656
understand some of the

1436
00:46:19,656 --> 0:46:20,806
parameters that you can use to

1437
00:46:21,066 --> 0:46:22,266
get exactly the effect you're

1438
00:46:22,266 --> 0:46:22,706
looking for.

1439
00:46:23,256 --> 0:46:26,056
Since there are a lot of pixels

1440
00:46:26,056 --> 0:46:27,136
moving around in a full screen

1441
00:46:27,136 --> 0:46:28,656
layout like this, we have some

1442
00:46:28,656 --> 0:46:30,126
best practices that we recommend

1443
00:46:30,126 --> 0:46:31,106
for getting the most out of

1444
00:46:31,106 --> 0:46:31,766
TVCollectionView

1445
00:46:31,766 --> 0:46:32,436
FullScreenLayout.

1446
00:46:32,956 --> 0:46:35,766
You should avoid starting any

1447
00:46:35,766 --> 0:46:37,096
animations or video until the

1448
00:46:37,096 --> 0:46:38,116
cell reaches the center.

1449
00:46:38,836 --> 0:46:40,056
Playing multiple videos at once

1450
00:46:40,056 --> 0:46:41,186
will not only be distracting to

1451
00:46:41,186 --> 0:46:42,336
people using your app, but it

1452
00:46:42,336 --> 0:46:43,596
will probably cause you drop

1453
00:46:43,596 --> 0:46:44,106
frames.

1454
00:46:44,686 --> 0:46:46,786
You should watch how many

1455
00:46:46,786 --> 0:46:48,106
offscreen passes you're using.

1456
00:46:48,376 --> 0:46:49,656
This means avoiding excessive

1457
00:46:49,656 --> 0:46:51,566
use of visual effects or group

1458
00:46:51,566 --> 0:46:52,736
opacity animations.

1459
00:46:53,126 --> 0:46:54,356
Really, most of the things that

1460
00:46:54,356 --> 0:46:56,276
you'd use to help with scrolling

1461
00:46:56,276 --> 0:46:57,396
in the rest of your app, you

1462
00:46:57,396 --> 0:46:58,526
could apply here when swiping

1463
00:46:58,526 --> 0:47:00,876
side to side.

1464
00:46:58,526 --> 0:47:00,876
side to side.

1465
00:47:01,106 --> 0:47:02,086
You should also be mindful of

1466
00:47:02,086 --> 0:47:02,996
your memory usage.

1467
00:47:03,306 --> 0:47:04,506
You'll probably be working with

1468
00:47:04,506 --> 0:47:05,876
a lot of large images in a

1469
00:47:05,876 --> 0:47:06,686
layout like this.

1470
00:47:06,976 --> 0:47:08,536
So, you should make sure that

1471
00:47:08,536 --> 0:47:09,886
their sized appropriately for

1472
00:47:09,886 --> 0:47:11,646
the display and that you release

1473
00:47:11,646 --> 0:47:12,766
them from memory when you're not

1474
00:47:12,766 --> 0:47:13,476
using them anymore.

1475
00:47:17,136 --> 0:47:19,016
If you're a TVMLKit developer,

1476
00:47:19,016 --> 0:47:20,136
don't think we forgot about you.

1477
00:47:20,666 --> 0:47:21,836
You can access all of these for

1478
00:47:21,836 --> 0:47:23,066
TVBrowserViewController.

1479
00:47:23,736 --> 0:47:25,086
We'll even link to a sample app

1480
00:47:25,086 --> 0:47:26,536
that shows you how easy it is to

1481
00:47:26,536 --> 0:47:27,866
build a smooth transition from a

1482
00:47:27,866 --> 0:47:29,576
shelf to a full screen browse

1483
00:47:29,576 --> 0:47:30,726
and back.

1484
00:47:32,476 --> 0:47:33,906
Today, we've taken you on a

1485
00:47:33,906 --> 0:47:35,676
journey, starting with people's

1486
00:47:35,676 --> 0:47:37,126
first exposure to your app, the

1487
00:47:37,126 --> 0:47:38,546
home screen and the Top Shelf.

1488
00:47:39,476 --> 0:47:40,466
It's a great way to grab

1489
00:47:40,466 --> 0:47:41,736
people's attention and draw them

1490
00:47:41,736 --> 0:47:42,126
into your app.

1491
00:47:43,256 --> 0:47:44,856
Then we moved on to the first

1492
00:47:44,856 --> 0:47:46,696
launch experience where you

1493
00:47:47,256 --> 0:47:48,796
learned how you can integrate

1494
00:47:48,796 --> 0:47:50,416
with multiuser to bring people

1495
00:47:50,416 --> 0:47:51,646
to their personalized content

1496
00:47:51,646 --> 0:47:53,196
right away without the need for

1497
00:47:53,196 --> 0:47:53,946
additional dialogues.

1498
00:47:55,296 --> 0:47:57,686
And, finally, we learned how you

1499
00:47:57,686 --> 0:47:59,096
can make browsing simple and

1500
00:47:59,096 --> 0:48:00,906
effortless with our new Tab Bar

1501
00:47:59,096 --> 0:48:00,906
effortless with our new Tab Bar

1502
00:48:00,906 --> 0:48:01,736
and full screen layout.

1503
00:48:02,826 --> 0:48:04,236
Together, all these made for

1504
00:48:04,236 --> 0:48:05,496
great usability in the living

1505
00:48:05,496 --> 0:48:05,756
room.

1506
00:48:06,126 --> 0:48:07,636
We hope you take the tools and

1507
00:48:07,636 --> 0:48:09,036
principles that we've shown you

1508
00:48:09,036 --> 0:48:10,706
here today and apply them in

1509
00:48:10,706 --> 0:48:12,376
your own apps so that everyone

1510
00:48:12,376 --> 0:48:14,106
using tvOS can have an enjoyable

1511
00:48:14,106 --> 0:48:14,746
experience.

1512
00:48:16,196 --> 0:48:17,556
You can see more information

1513
00:48:17,556 --> 0:48:19,216
about our talk here and come see

1514
00:48:19,216 --> 0:48:20,336
us on our labs in Wednesday and

1515
00:48:20,336 --> 0:48:20,856
Friday.

1516
00:48:23,006 --> 0:48:23,726
Thanks everybody.
