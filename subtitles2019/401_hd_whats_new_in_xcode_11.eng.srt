00:00:08,576 --> 0:00:09,146
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

4
00:00:14,046 --> 0:00:16,386
Well, Xcode 11 has a ton of new

5
00:00:16,446 --> 0:00:18,106
features and improvements.

6
00:00:19,026 --> 0:00:20,896
Everything the tools do is in

7
00:00:20,896 --> 0:00:22,016
support of getting you from an

8
00:00:22,016 --> 0:00:23,936
idea, through development to

9
00:00:23,936 --> 0:00:26,156
delivering a great product.

10
00:00:26,766 --> 0:00:28,476
We want the tools to make you

11
00:00:28,476 --> 0:00:29,796
more productive, so you can

12
00:00:29,796 --> 0:00:31,576
spend more time dreaming up and

13
00:00:31,576 --> 0:00:32,766
implementing the next great

14
00:00:32,806 --> 0:00:32,986
thing.

15
00:00:33,786 --> 0:00:37,066
So, this year we focused on

16
00:00:37,066 --> 0:00:38,636
making it more efficient and

17
00:00:38,636 --> 0:00:41,016
faster for you to use the tools

18
00:00:41,116 --> 0:00:42,536
we rethought some of the basic

19
00:00:42,816 --> 0:00:43,526
workflows.

20
00:00:44,346 --> 0:00:44,846
Let's take a look.

21
00:00:45,306 --> 0:00:48,236
We'll start with a quick recap

22
00:00:48,506 --> 0:00:49,816
of Xcode 10.

23
00:00:50,666 --> 0:00:52,126
Now in Xcode 10, there's three

24
00:00:52,126 --> 0:00:54,366
main Editor modes, Standard,

25
00:00:54,566 --> 0:00:56,496
Assistant and Version, and they

26
00:00:56,496 --> 0:00:57,686
live up here in the toolbar,

27
00:00:57,896 --> 0:00:59,146
because they apply to the entire

28
00:00:59,146 --> 0:01:00,256
windows content.

29
00:00:59,146 --> 0:01:00,256
windows content.

30
00:01:00,816 --> 0:01:03,216
Now, the Version Editor, it's

31
00:01:03,216 --> 0:01:04,446
got three modes of its own,

32
00:01:04,736 --> 0:01:06,876
Comparison, Authors, and Log.

33
00:01:07,476 --> 0:01:08,656
So, you've got a lot of

34
00:01:08,656 --> 0:01:10,396
functionality available to you.

35
00:01:10,756 --> 0:01:12,236
You just have to pick the one

36
00:01:12,236 --> 0:01:12,976
thing that you're most

37
00:01:12,976 --> 0:01:13,526
interested in.

38
00:01:14,156 --> 0:01:15,586
Well, we heard your feedback

39
00:01:15,586 --> 0:01:16,696
that you wanted more

40
00:01:16,696 --> 0:01:17,526
flexibility.

41
00:01:18,036 --> 0:01:19,956
And so, we, we made some

42
00:01:19,956 --> 0:01:20,636
improvements.

43
00:01:22,086 --> 0:01:24,046
At first, we took the Source

44
00:01:24,046 --> 0:01:25,966
Control Log information, and we

45
00:01:25,966 --> 0:01:27,346
moved it over to the Inspector,

46
00:01:27,706 --> 0:01:29,476
where it's now available all the

47
00:01:29,476 --> 0:01:30,776
time for any file.

48
00:01:30,876 --> 0:01:32,526
So, you can bring it in when you

49
00:01:32,526 --> 0:01:34,396
need it, without ever disrupting

50
00:01:34,396 --> 0:01:36,046
what's in the main editor area.

51
00:01:36,606 --> 0:01:39,306
And next, we wanted to let you

52
00:01:39,346 --> 0:01:41,346
change each Editor Panes mode

53
00:01:41,346 --> 0:01:43,416
independently, because we know

54
00:01:43,416 --> 0:01:45,406
that different file types like

55
00:01:45,406 --> 0:01:47,006
Source Code and Storyboards,

56
00:01:47,436 --> 0:01:48,246
they have very different

57
00:01:48,246 --> 0:01:48,836
workflows.

58
00:01:49,886 --> 0:01:51,586
So we move the Assistant and the

59
00:01:51,586 --> 0:01:53,886
Authors out of the main toolbar

60
00:01:54,516 --> 0:01:56,286
down into each editor pane.

61
00:01:56,866 --> 0:01:57,706
So, now you can choose the right

62
00:01:57,706 --> 0:01:59,226
mode for each editor.

63
00:01:59,766 --> 0:02:01,816
Now a lot of people use the

64
00:01:59,766 --> 0:02:01,816
Now a lot of people use the

65
00:02:01,816 --> 0:02:03,566
Assistant today to split up

66
00:02:03,566 --> 0:02:05,206
their Xcode window with multiple

67
00:02:05,256 --> 0:02:05,836
editors.

68
00:02:06,646 --> 0:02:08,656
Well in Xcode 11, you can create

69
00:02:08,656 --> 0:02:11,196
splits anytime, anywhere.

70
00:02:12,306 --> 0:02:13,616
And you can split both

71
00:02:13,716 --> 0:02:15,816
horizontally, as well as

72
00:02:15,856 --> 0:02:17,556
vertically, all within the same

73
00:02:17,556 --> 0:02:17,916
window.

74
00:02:18,466 --> 0:02:21,016
So, there's a lot of added

75
00:02:21,016 --> 0:02:22,406
flexibility this year which

76
00:02:22,406 --> 0:02:23,916
really does make it easier than

77
00:02:23,916 --> 0:02:25,576
ever to work the way that you

78
00:02:25,576 --> 0:02:25,946
want.

79
00:02:26,486 --> 0:02:29,046
Now there is no better way to

80
00:02:29,046 --> 0:02:30,846
see this than in a demo.

81
00:02:30,846 --> 0:02:32,266
So, here to show it to you now

82
00:02:32,676 --> 0:02:33,146
is Brendan.

84
00:02:38,866 --> 0:02:39,406
&gt;&gt; Thanks Ken.

85
00:02:42,206 --> 0:02:44,166
So, we've given Xcode a bit of a

86
00:02:44,166 --> 0:02:45,796
renovation this year to give you

87
00:02:45,796 --> 0:02:47,246
more control of your workspace.

88
00:02:48,516 --> 0:02:50,076
One of the most visible changes,

89
00:02:50,126 --> 0:02:53,006
is to the Editor Splitting and

90
00:02:53,376 --> 0:02:54,036
the Assistant.

91
00:02:54,796 --> 0:02:55,616
So, let me start with the

92
00:02:55,616 --> 0:02:57,276
Assistant, and its new companion

93
00:02:57,576 --> 0:03:00,876
mode, the SwiftUI Canvas.

94
00:02:57,576 --> 0:03:00,876
mode, the SwiftUI Canvas.

95
00:03:01,246 --> 0:03:02,676
Each editor has an options menu

96
00:03:02,676 --> 0:03:03,296
in the top right.

97
00:03:04,346 --> 0:03:05,546
This is where you control the

98
00:03:05,546 --> 0:03:07,636
behavior of the editor.

99
00:03:07,636 --> 0:03:09,366
I have this one set to Editor in

100
00:03:09,366 --> 0:03:11,556
Canvas, which means that if

101
00:03:11,586 --> 0:03:13,686
there is a SwiftUI preview to

102
00:03:13,686 --> 0:03:16,016
show, Xcode will show it.

103
00:03:16,066 --> 0:03:16,976
In this case, there is no

104
00:03:17,016 --> 0:03:17,366
preview.

105
00:03:17,616 --> 0:03:18,876
So there's nothing to see.

106
00:03:19,646 --> 0:03:21,386
But if I switch over to a file

107
00:03:21,386 --> 0:03:22,956
that has a preview the Canvas

108
00:03:22,956 --> 0:03:24,496
appears and Xcode renders a

109
00:03:24,686 --> 0:03:25,616
preview of my UI.

110
00:03:26,266 --> 0:03:28,376
Now, the Assistant works the

111
00:03:28,376 --> 0:03:28,816
same way.

112
00:03:29,686 --> 0:03:31,016
If I switch over to the

113
00:03:31,016 --> 0:03:32,186
Assistant using the options

114
00:03:32,216 --> 0:03:34,496
menu, Xcode will show me the

115
00:03:34,496 --> 0:03:36,746
generated interface for this

116
00:03:38,276 --> 0:03:38,406
file.

117
00:03:38,596 --> 0:03:39,996
But if I switch to a file that

118
00:03:39,996 --> 0:03:42,216
doesn't have an Assistant, like

119
00:03:42,216 --> 0:03:44,156
the project, it gets out of the

120
00:03:44,156 --> 0:03:44,356
way.

121
00:03:45,236 --> 0:03:46,376
There's no space wasted and

122
00:03:46,376 --> 0:03:47,626
there's no need for me to spend

123
00:03:47,626 --> 0:03:49,286
time manually switching modes as

124
00:03:49,286 --> 0:03:50,256
I switch between files.

125
00:03:50,896 --> 0:03:52,936
All right.

126
00:03:53,126 --> 0:03:55,176
When I switch back to a source

127
00:03:55,416 --> 0:03:56,966
file, of course, it remembers

128
00:03:56,966 --> 0:03:57,776
the state I was in, the

129
00:03:57,776 --> 0:03:58,666
Assistant comes back.

130
00:03:59,856 --> 0:04:01,786
So, that's the Assistant, and

131
00:03:59,856 --> 0:04:01,786
So, that's the Assistant, and

132
00:04:01,846 --> 0:04:04,086
the SwiftUI Canvas, let's talk

133
00:04:04,086 --> 0:04:05,056
about Editor Splitting.

134
00:04:05,326 --> 0:04:07,326
The first thing is, it no longer

135
00:04:07,326 --> 0:04:08,386
requires the Assistant.

136
00:04:08,386 --> 0:04:10,246
So, let me get that out of the

137
00:04:10,896 --> 0:04:10,986
way.

138
00:04:11,206 --> 0:04:12,106
So, there's a few different ways

139
00:04:12,106 --> 0:04:13,146
I can split this window up.

140
00:04:13,146 --> 0:04:14,856
I'm going to start with the Add

141
00:04:15,186 --> 0:04:16,505
Editor button, which is up here

142
00:04:16,505 --> 0:04:17,826
in the corner, next to the

143
00:04:17,826 --> 0:04:18,565
options menu.

144
00:04:19,375 --> 0:04:20,826
When I click that, I get two

145
00:04:20,826 --> 0:04:21,745
independent editors.

146
00:04:22,166 --> 0:04:23,656
These editors have their own

147
00:04:23,706 --> 0:04:24,266
state.

148
00:04:24,326 --> 0:04:26,046
So if I want to, I can turn on

149
00:04:26,046 --> 0:04:27,306
modes like Code Coverage or

150
00:04:27,306 --> 0:04:28,856
Authors for each editor

151
00:04:28,856 --> 0:04:29,486
individually.

152
00:04:30,566 --> 0:04:32,176
The new editor is active.

153
00:04:32,866 --> 0:04:34,446
So to load another file into it,

154
00:04:34,886 --> 0:04:36,566
all I have to do is click on the

155
00:04:36,566 --> 0:04:36,826
file.

156
00:04:36,826 --> 0:04:37,566
All right.

157
00:04:39,396 --> 0:04:41,346
So, I've got two editors, I've

158
00:04:41,346 --> 0:04:42,826
got two files, let's add a

159
00:04:42,826 --> 0:04:43,116
third.

160
00:04:43,116 --> 0:04:45,626
I'm going to split the editor on

161
00:04:45,626 --> 0:04:47,196
the left, so I'm going to use

162
00:04:47,196 --> 0:04:48,386
the Add Editor button in the

163
00:04:48,386 --> 0:04:49,036
left editor.

164
00:04:49,036 --> 0:04:50,516
And I'm going to hold the option

165
00:04:50,516 --> 0:04:52,966
key down, so that I can split it

166
00:04:52,966 --> 0:04:53,886
in the opposite direction.

167
00:04:54,336 --> 0:04:55,636
The icon rotates to show me

168
00:04:55,636 --> 0:04:56,326
what's going to happen.

169
00:04:57,616 --> 0:04:58,506
So, I got an editor on the

170
00:04:58,506 --> 0:04:59,966
bottom, and it's active.

171
00:05:00,436 --> 0:05:04,596
So, another click and I've

172
00:05:04,596 --> 0:05:05,356
loaded that file.

173
00:05:06,816 --> 0:05:07,876
Sometimes I want to do that the

174
00:05:07,876 --> 0:05:08,726
other way around, though,

175
00:05:08,726 --> 0:05:10,076
sometimes I want to click on a

176
00:05:10,076 --> 0:05:11,596
file and tell Xcode where to put

177
00:05:11,596 --> 0:05:11,716
it.

178
00:05:12,466 --> 0:05:13,896
For that, I use the Destination

179
00:05:13,896 --> 0:05:14,226
Chooser.

180
00:05:14,716 --> 0:05:16,006
I'll just hold option and shift.

181
00:05:16,896 --> 0:05:18,016
Click on the file that I want,

182
00:05:18,016 --> 0:05:19,276
and the Destination Chooser

183
00:05:19,276 --> 0:05:19,666
appears.

184
00:05:20,386 --> 0:05:22,476
Now I can just hit return to

185
00:05:22,476 --> 0:05:23,606
open it in the active editor.

186
00:05:24,596 --> 0:05:26,506
Or I can use the arrow keys or

187
00:05:26,506 --> 0:05:29,366
the mouse to insert a new editor

188
00:05:29,366 --> 0:05:31,506
here, to open it in this editor,

189
00:05:31,636 --> 0:05:33,476
put an editor there, over here,

190
00:05:33,476 --> 0:05:34,066
whatever I want.

191
00:05:34,066 --> 0:05:35,896
I can also use standard keyboard

192
00:05:35,896 --> 0:05:37,156
shortcuts to do things like

193
00:05:37,156 --> 0:05:39,576
switch tabs, put it somewhere

194
00:05:39,576 --> 0:05:41,476
over here, or switch windows,

195
00:05:42,236 --> 0:05:43,216
put it somewhere over here.

196
00:05:44,216 --> 0:05:45,236
There's a lot of flexibility

197
00:05:45,236 --> 0:05:46,186
here, a lot of power.

198
00:05:46,816 --> 0:05:47,776
So, I'm going to put this one

199
00:05:47,776 --> 0:05:49,666
down here under the Globe Scene.

200
00:05:50,146 --> 0:05:50,946
Just press return.

201
00:05:52,266 --> 0:05:53,706
And I've got a set of files that

202
00:05:53,706 --> 0:05:55,186
I want to work with, a layout

203
00:05:55,186 --> 0:05:57,056
that I like, everything's set,

204
00:05:57,496 --> 0:06:01,106
but what if I want to just focus

205
00:05:57,496 --> 0:06:01,106
but what if I want to just focus

206
00:06:01,106 --> 0:06:02,436
on one of these files for a

207
00:06:02,926 --> 0:06:03,086
minute.

208
00:06:03,836 --> 0:06:05,226
That's what the new Focus mode

209
00:06:05,226 --> 0:06:08,096
is for, each editor has a button

210
00:06:08,096 --> 0:06:09,936
in the corner next to the close

211
00:06:09,936 --> 0:06:12,446
button and if I click that, I

212
00:06:12,446 --> 0:06:14,396
can zoom in this editor to take

213
00:06:14,396 --> 0:06:15,126
over the whole window.

214
00:06:15,126 --> 0:06:17,036
So, let me use that to zoom in

215
00:06:17,036 --> 0:06:18,236
and talk about what's new in the

216
00:06:18,236 --> 0:06:18,846
Source Editor.

217
00:06:19,446 --> 0:06:22,616
So, one of my favorite new

218
00:06:22,616 --> 0:06:24,006
features in the Source Editor is

219
00:06:24,006 --> 0:06:26,786
the Minimap that's in the

220
00:06:26,786 --> 0:06:27,716
options menu, of course.

221
00:06:27,796 --> 0:06:30,336
So, I'll turn on Minimap, and

222
00:06:30,336 --> 0:06:31,766
then let me make it a little bit

223
00:06:31,766 --> 0:06:32,736
bigger, so you can see it.

224
00:06:33,706 --> 0:06:36,356
So, the Minimap, of course, is a

225
00:06:36,356 --> 0:06:37,846
bird's eye view of your code, it

226
00:06:37,846 --> 0:06:39,186
shows you the contours of your

227
00:06:39,186 --> 0:06:40,396
code it shows you the syntax

228
00:06:40,396 --> 0:06:40,876
coloring.

229
00:06:41,926 --> 0:06:44,036
And it's meant for navigation.

230
00:06:44,106 --> 0:06:45,156
So, it tells you where you're

231
00:06:45,156 --> 0:06:46,496
going before you get there, as

232
00:06:46,496 --> 0:06:47,376
you hover over different

233
00:06:47,376 --> 0:06:49,356
elements, it shows you exactly

234
00:06:49,356 --> 0:06:50,596
what it is, so you know where

235
00:06:50,596 --> 0:06:50,966
you're going.

236
00:06:51,946 --> 0:06:52,996
It also shows you important

237
00:06:52,996 --> 0:06:54,666
landmarks, like, where you have

238
00:06:54,666 --> 0:06:56,106
changes in your file or where

239
00:06:56,106 --> 0:06:58,616
you have breakpoints, the text

240
00:06:58,616 --> 0:07:00,566
you see down here are marks that

241
00:06:58,616 --> 0:07:00,566
you see down here are marks that

242
00:07:00,566 --> 0:07:02,096
I've inserted into my code to

243
00:07:02,096 --> 0:07:02,676
organize it.

244
00:07:02,676 --> 0:07:04,436
And if I click on one of those,

245
00:07:04,436 --> 0:07:05,516
you can see that we render the

246
00:07:05,516 --> 0:07:06,746
marks in the Minimap, and the

247
00:07:06,746 --> 0:07:07,996
Source Editor the same,

248
00:07:08,266 --> 0:07:09,636
including the divider lines to

249
00:07:09,636 --> 0:07:11,456
help anchor you as you scroll

250
00:07:12,026 --> 0:07:12,166
around.

251
00:07:12,936 --> 0:07:15,046
The Minimap also shows transient

252
00:07:15,046 --> 0:07:15,646
information.

253
00:07:15,896 --> 0:07:17,986
So, if I do find, for instance,

254
00:07:20,356 --> 0:07:22,606
Minimap shows me all of the

255
00:07:22,606 --> 0:07:25,096
matches in my file and it fades

256
00:07:25,166 --> 0:07:26,326
some of the other information,

257
00:07:26,326 --> 0:07:27,606
so that that stands out, so you

258
00:07:27,606 --> 0:07:28,986
can see exactly where you are,

259
00:07:29,696 --> 0:07:31,276
and the context of your current

260
00:07:31,276 --> 0:07:31,696
match.

261
00:07:35,186 --> 0:07:35,486
All right.

262
00:07:35,486 --> 0:07:36,376
So, that's the Minimap.

263
00:07:37,076 --> 0:07:38,426
Over on the source code side,

264
00:07:38,906 --> 0:07:39,996
we've made some improvements,

265
00:07:40,056 --> 0:07:42,236
like new syntax coloring options

266
00:07:42,776 --> 0:07:45,026
like these declarations you see

267
00:07:45,026 --> 0:07:45,326
here.

268
00:07:45,326 --> 0:07:47,776
And we've added new themes,

269
00:07:47,776 --> 0:07:49,566
including high contrast themes

270
00:07:49,596 --> 0:07:50,796
in light and dark.

271
00:07:54,716 --> 0:07:57,366
And we've given documentation, a

272
00:07:57,366 --> 0:07:58,566
big boost in readability.

273
00:07:59,686 --> 0:08:00,936
We've restyled it, so that it

274
00:07:59,686 --> 0:08:00,936
We've restyled it, so that it

275
00:08:00,936 --> 0:08:02,396
reads more like documentation

276
00:08:02,936 --> 0:08:04,616
and Xcode now understands a lot

277
00:08:04,616 --> 0:08:06,846
more of the structure of your

278
00:08:06,846 --> 0:08:08,106
documentation to help make it

279
00:08:08,106 --> 0:08:08,966
easier to maintain.

280
00:08:09,446 --> 0:08:10,516
So let me give you an example.

281
00:08:10,516 --> 0:08:12,796
I have here a function which is

282
00:08:12,796 --> 0:08:13,656
fully documented.

283
00:08:14,436 --> 0:08:18,446
But, if I add a new parameter to

284
00:08:18,446 --> 0:08:20,106
this and I'll make it a double.

285
00:08:20,576 --> 0:08:23,626
I'll give it a value and then

286
00:08:23,626 --> 0:08:25,286
let me use my parameter down

287
00:08:25,286 --> 0:08:26,856
here, so I don't get any issues.

288
00:08:27,696 --> 0:08:30,366
Now, I can use the action pop

289
00:08:30,366 --> 0:08:31,976
over and Add Documentation to

290
00:08:31,976 --> 0:08:34,196
fill in the gaps in my code.

291
00:08:34,785 --> 0:08:38,126
Best of all, it also works with

292
00:08:38,596 --> 0:08:39,785
multiple cursors, so if you have

293
00:08:39,785 --> 0:08:40,966
a bunch of gaps to fill it's

294
00:08:40,966 --> 0:08:41,496
really easy.

295
00:08:41,525 --> 0:08:42,186
All right.

296
00:08:44,416 --> 0:08:46,606
So, I got my documentation.

297
00:08:47,036 --> 0:08:48,656
Now, let's say hypothetically,

298
00:08:48,656 --> 0:08:49,986
you're on stage in front of a

299
00:08:50,036 --> 0:08:51,866
very large audience, and you've

300
00:08:51,866 --> 0:08:53,986
just made a typo in your code,

301
00:08:54,086 --> 0:08:55,746
and then you've used Code

302
00:08:55,746 --> 0:08:58,496
Completion and Add Documentation

303
00:08:58,496 --> 0:08:59,826
to spread that typo around.

304
00:09:00,646 --> 0:09:03,476
Well, Edit All In Scope can now

305
00:09:03,986 --> 0:09:06,136
clean up your mistakes very

306
00:09:06,136 --> 0:09:08,046
quickly, your signature, your

307
00:09:08,046 --> 0:09:09,596
code, and now, even the

308
00:09:09,596 --> 0:09:12,086
documentation, can be fixed in

309
00:09:12,086 --> 0:09:12,466
one go.

310
00:09:13,516 --> 0:09:17,376
[ Applause ]

311
00:09:17,876 --> 0:09:18,116
All right.

312
00:09:18,786 --> 0:09:19,786
One last thing I want to show

313
00:09:19,786 --> 0:09:20,946
you in the Source Editor that

314
00:09:20,946 --> 0:09:23,026
I'm really excited about is an

315
00:09:23,026 --> 0:09:24,236
enhancement to change bars.

316
00:09:24,796 --> 0:09:26,036
So down here at the bottom of my

317
00:09:26,036 --> 0:09:27,386
file I have a change that I made

318
00:09:27,386 --> 0:09:27,786
earlier.

319
00:09:28,426 --> 0:09:29,646
Change bars have always shown

320
00:09:29,646 --> 0:09:32,146
you that a reminder of the

321
00:09:32,146 --> 0:09:33,536
changes you made earlier which

322
00:09:33,636 --> 0:09:35,256
lines in your file have changed.

323
00:09:35,666 --> 0:09:36,746
If you hover over the change

324
00:09:36,746 --> 0:09:37,966
bar, it shows you where on the

325
00:09:37,966 --> 0:09:38,896
line those changes are.

326
00:09:39,476 --> 0:09:42,626
But now you can click on the

327
00:09:42,626 --> 0:09:43,826
change bar and there's a new

328
00:09:44,106 --> 0:09:45,756
Show Change command, which shows

329
00:09:45,756 --> 0:09:46,956
an Inline Diff right there in

330
00:09:46,956 --> 0:09:47,436
your file.

331
00:09:47,976 --> 0:09:49,216
If you hover over the bar again

332
00:09:49,216 --> 0:09:50,246
you can see exactly what it

333
00:09:50,246 --> 0:09:51,996
changed from what it changed to,

334
00:09:52,536 --> 0:09:53,836
and it's live, so any updates

335
00:09:53,876 --> 0:09:55,236
that you make will be reflected

336
00:09:55,236 --> 0:09:57,656
immediately in the diff.

337
00:09:57,886 --> 0:09:58,806
So that's everything I want to

338
00:09:58,806 --> 0:10:00,056
show in this first editor, let

339
00:09:58,806 --> 0:10:00,056
show in this first editor, let

340
00:10:00,056 --> 0:10:01,276
me pop back out to the big

341
00:10:01,276 --> 0:10:02,706
picture again to do that I just

342
00:10:02,706 --> 0:10:03,996
click the Focus button again.

343
00:10:05,046 --> 0:10:06,196
And my layout comes back just

344
00:10:06,196 --> 0:10:06,776
where I left it.

345
00:10:07,726 --> 0:10:09,206
One last thing before I go, I

346
00:10:09,206 --> 0:10:11,836
want to do a quick code review

347
00:10:11,836 --> 0:10:13,486
of my changes here.

348
00:10:13,866 --> 0:10:14,716
So, I'm going to click the Code

349
00:10:14,716 --> 0:10:16,066
Review button, and that's going

350
00:10:16,066 --> 0:10:17,466
to take the active editor and

351
00:10:17,466 --> 0:10:18,696
blow it up to the full window,

352
00:10:18,696 --> 0:10:19,996
so that I can concentrate on the

353
00:10:19,996 --> 0:10:21,736
task at hand, just like Focus

354
00:10:21,736 --> 0:10:22,006
mode.

355
00:10:22,476 --> 0:10:24,736
When I'm done, I click again, my

356
00:10:24,736 --> 0:10:25,516
layout comes back.

357
00:10:26,336 --> 0:10:28,966
That is a quick whirlwind tour

358
00:10:29,106 --> 0:10:30,346
of some of the many workflow

359
00:10:30,346 --> 0:10:31,546

&gt;&gt; Thanks Brendan.

363
00:10:40,546 --> 0:10:42,136
I love that new Minimap, by the

364
00:10:42,136 --> 0:10:42,286
way.

365
00:10:42,286 --> 0:10:44,666
And there's so many other great

366
00:10:44,666 --> 0:10:46,196
Source Editor features this year

367
00:10:46,866 --> 0:10:48,686
from Spell Checking to Nested

368
00:10:48,686 --> 0:10:50,356
Code Folding to Inline Diff,

369
00:10:50,466 --> 0:10:51,196
just to name a few.

370
00:10:51,676 --> 0:10:53,206
But one area in particular that

371
00:10:53,206 --> 0:10:54,646
we focused on over the last year

372
00:10:55,136 --> 0:10:56,676
is Code Completion and giving

373
00:10:56,676 --> 0:10:58,046
you better results in more

374
00:10:58,046 --> 0:10:58,666
places.

375
00:11:00,166 --> 0:11:01,776
There's now Code Completions for

376
00:11:01,956 --> 0:11:04,936
Compiler Control statements and

377
00:11:05,256 --> 0:11:07,336
that never Completions work more

378
00:11:07,336 --> 0:11:09,456
reliably, and in more places

379
00:11:09,636 --> 0:11:11,026
like here, when you're pending

380
00:11:11,096 --> 0:11:13,636
an enum to an array [applause].

381
00:11:14,216 --> 0:11:14,936
All right [applause].

382
00:11:17,836 --> 0:11:19,576
And there's now Code Completions

383
00:11:19,696 --> 0:11:20,996
for function overload.

384
00:11:20,996 --> 0:11:23,056
So these are just a few of the

385
00:11:23,056 --> 0:11:25,266
many Completions we've improved

386
00:11:25,446 --> 0:11:26,156
in Xcode 11.

387
00:11:27,476 --> 0:11:29,126
Now, let's look at the Source

388
00:11:29,126 --> 0:11:30,546
Code Editor, and workflow.

389
00:11:31,126 --> 0:11:35,966
Now, this is a huge year for

00:11:35,966 --> 0:11:37,266
Swift Package Manager.

391
00:11:38,196 --> 0:11:39,316
It's been thriving since we

392
00:11:39,316 --> 0:11:41,366
introduced it with tons of

393
00:11:41,366 --> 0:11:44,046
packages available today, all of

394
00:11:44,046 --> 0:11:45,546
which let you build on the great

395
00:11:45,546 --> 0:11:47,536
work happening in the community.

396
00:11:48,536 --> 0:11:49,636
The packages are a great way to

397
00:11:49,636 --> 0:11:51,496
factor your own code, breaking

398
00:11:51,496 --> 0:11:52,676
it up into smaller, more

399
00:11:52,676 --> 0:11:53,656
testable pieces.

400
00:11:54,956 --> 0:11:56,286
Well, this year, we have fully

401
00:11:56,286 --> 0:11:57,936
integrated Swift Package Manager

402
00:11:58,126 --> 0:11:58,866
with Xcode.

403
00:11:59,266 --> 0:12:00,976
You can use packages to build

404
00:11:59,266 --> 0:12:00,976
You can use packages to build

405
00:12:00,976 --> 0:12:02,976
apps for all of the platforms.

And packages, get first class

408
00:12:13,336 --> 0:12:15,016
integration throughout Xcode,

409
00:12:15,546 --> 0:12:17,836
from Source Control integration,

410
00:12:17,836 --> 0:12:19,376
to debugging, to testing,

411
00:12:19,846 --> 0:12:21,066
everything that you do with

412
00:12:21,066 --> 0:12:23,286
packages, it works just like

413
00:12:23,286 --> 0:12:24,786
you're used to, with projects.

414
00:12:25,486 --> 0:12:26,936
And Xcode makes it easy to

415
00:12:26,936 --> 0:12:29,076
discover and use packages, and

416
00:12:29,076 --> 0:12:31,056
then just as easy to create and

417
00:12:31,056 --> 0:12:32,586
share your own with the world.

418
00:12:33,176 --> 0:12:35,816
The integration with multiple

419
00:12:35,816 --> 0:12:38,036
services means that you are only

420
00:12:38,036 --> 0:12:40,356
ever just a few clicks away from

421
00:12:40,356 --> 0:12:42,016
some awesome code.

We really think you are going to

423
00:12:44,056 --> 0:12:45,646
love using Swift Packages.

424
00:12:46,696 --> 0:12:47,726
And here to show you how to get

425
00:12:47,726 --> 0:12:49,156

show you all Swift Packages in

Xcode 11.

433
00:13:02,826 --> 0:13:05,776
I will be working on our travel

434
00:13:05,776 --> 0:13:07,086
app, which includes a trip

435
00:13:07,086 --> 0:13:07,636
planning feature.

436
00:13:08,686 --> 0:13:09,566
This feature right now doesn't

437
00:13:09,566 --> 0:13:10,486
have any weather information

438
00:13:10,486 --> 0:13:11,496
which is a pretty important part

439
00:13:11,496 --> 0:13:12,046
about any trip.

440
00:13:12,736 --> 0:13:14,216
I don't want to have to reinvent

441
00:13:14,216 --> 0:13:14,916
the wheel to get this

442
00:13:14,916 --> 0:13:16,606
information in my app.

443
00:13:16,796 --> 0:13:18,706
Lucky for me, my coworker Rhonda

444
00:13:18,706 --> 0:13:19,736
told me about a package that I

445
00:13:19,736 --> 0:13:20,926
could use to do just this.

446
00:13:21,516 --> 0:13:22,546
So, let's add it to our project.

447
00:13:23,836 --> 0:13:26,276
I'll start by navigating to the

448
00:13:26,276 --> 0:13:26,916
Project Editor.

449
00:13:27,776 --> 0:13:28,966
And I'll navigate to the project

450
00:13:30,086 --> 0:13:31,006
where I'll see a new Swift

451
00:13:31,006 --> 0:13:31,666
Packages tab.

452
00:13:32,696 --> 0:13:34,176
This tab will show me any

453
00:13:34,176 --> 0:13:35,276
packages that my project

454
00:13:35,276 --> 0:13:36,006
currently depends on.

455
00:13:37,226 --> 0:13:38,856
To add the first, I'll click the

456
00:13:38,856 --> 0:13:39,396
plus button.

457
00:13:40,036 --> 0:13:40,986
And because I've already logged

458
00:13:40,986 --> 0:13:42,486
in with my GitHub account, I can

459
00:13:42,486 --> 0:13:43,836
see all of my personal packages,

460
00:13:43,986 --> 0:13:45,456
organizational packages, as well

461
00:13:45,456 --> 0:13:46,606
as my starred repos right at the

462
00:13:48,136 --> 0:13:49,376
top Here's that forecast package

463
00:13:49,376 --> 0:13:50,006
I was talking about.

464
00:13:51,116 --> 0:13:52,936
So, if I click next, Xcode will

465
00:13:52,936 --> 0:13:54,436
prompt me for my version

466
00:13:54,436 --> 0:13:56,196
information here, and Xcode will

467
00:13:56,196 --> 0:13:57,616
automatically fill in the most

468
00:13:57,616 --> 0:13:59,616
recent up-to-date version for me

469
00:13:59,616 --> 0:14:00,106
to start using.

470
00:13:59,616 --> 0:14:00,106
to start using.

471
00:14:00,206 --> 0:14:01,416
And that's what I want because I

472
00:14:01,416 --> 0:14:02,386
want the most up-to-date code,

473
00:14:02,486 --> 0:14:02,816
right away.

474
00:14:04,256 --> 0:14:06,036
When I click next, Xcode will

475
00:14:06,036 --> 0:14:07,246
resolve any dependencies that my

476
00:14:07,246 --> 0:14:08,826
package may have, but because

477
00:14:08,826 --> 0:14:10,066
it's this pretty simple package,

478
00:14:10,096 --> 0:14:10,806
it doesn't have any

479
00:14:10,806 --> 0:14:11,796
dependencies, it will resolve

480
00:14:11,796 --> 0:14:12,146
right away.

481
00:14:13,426 --> 0:14:16,236
Finally, I need to choose which

482
00:14:16,236 --> 0:14:17,586
target to link my package

483
00:14:17,636 --> 0:14:18,776
product against, and I'll choose

484
00:14:18,776 --> 0:14:20,396
my app target here, and I'll

485
00:14:20,396 --> 0:14:21,526
finish up.

486
00:14:22,276 --> 0:14:23,186
So, that was it.

487
00:14:23,336 --> 0:14:24,356
All I had to do to set up my

488
00:14:24,356 --> 0:14:26,126
package in my project was to add

489
00:14:26,126 --> 0:14:27,376
it to this dependency section.

[ Applause ]

491
00:14:34,286 --> 0:14:35,066
And over in the project

492
00:14:35,066 --> 0:14:36,276
navigator, I now have a Swift

493
00:14:36,276 --> 0:14:37,426
Package dependency section,

494
00:14:37,586 --> 0:14:38,776
where I can browse all of the

495
00:14:38,776 --> 0:14:40,206
source of this package, just

496
00:14:40,206 --> 0:14:41,256
like it were part of my project,

497
00:14:41,316 --> 0:14:41,926
because it is.

498
00:14:43,886 --> 0:14:45,116
Great. So, I have a pretty good

499
00:14:45,116 --> 0:14:45,836
idea of where I need to

500
00:14:45,836 --> 0:14:46,966
implement this functionality.

501
00:14:46,966 --> 0:14:48,066
I'm going to put it right in my

502
00:14:48,066 --> 0:14:49,526
Weather Fetcher Swift file here,

503
00:14:49,666 --> 0:14:50,346
which currently doesn't do a

504
00:14:50,346 --> 0:14:50,766
whole lot.

505
00:14:51,836 --> 0:14:53,826
Now that I've configured it, I

506
00:14:53,826 --> 0:14:55,776
can quickly import the forecast

507
00:14:55,816 --> 0:14:56,316
module.

508
00:14:56,886 --> 0:15:00,186
And I'll start by creating a

509
00:14:56,886 --> 0:15:00,186
And I'll start by creating a

510
00:15:00,186 --> 0:15:04,916
Forecast Object using the region

511
00:15:05,536 --> 0:15:06,456
that was passed in.

512
00:15:07,826 --> 0:15:08,896
But I just grabbed this package

513
00:15:08,896 --> 0:15:09,916
on GitHub and I'm not very

514
00:15:09,916 --> 0:15:10,706
familiar with the API.

515
00:15:10,706 --> 0:15:12,486
I could go look at it on the

516
00:15:12,486 --> 0:15:13,956
web, but because of the

517
00:15:14,016 --> 0:15:15,246
first-class citizen right here

518
00:15:15,276 --> 0:15:17,176
in Xcode, I can quickly jump to

519
00:15:17,176 --> 0:15:18,506
its definition and start

520
00:15:18,506 --> 0:15:19,876
browsing its source right away.

521
00:15:21,426 --> 0:15:22,466
So, I'll scroll down a little

522
00:15:22,466 --> 0:15:22,726
bit.

523
00:15:22,796 --> 0:15:24,616
And this observations method

524
00:15:24,616 --> 0:15:25,596
looks like what I want to use.

525
00:15:26,396 --> 0:15:27,346
But I'm not familiar with this

526
00:15:27,456 --> 0:15:29,136
observations structure this

527
00:15:29,136 --> 0:15:29,386
type.

528
00:15:29,866 --> 0:15:31,306
So I want to I want to jump in

529
00:15:31,306 --> 0:15:32,506
and find out more about it as

530
00:15:32,506 --> 0:15:32,736
well.

531
00:15:33,426 --> 0:15:35,046
And to show off some of our new

532
00:15:35,146 --> 0:15:36,276
search functionality in Xcode

533
00:15:36,276 --> 0:15:38,486
11, I'll use the find navigator

534
00:15:38,486 --> 0:15:40,306
by using command shift F.

535
00:15:40,926 --> 0:15:42,956
And I'll navigate down to the

536
00:15:43,026 --> 0:15:44,166
Forecast Package here to narrow

537
00:15:44,166 --> 0:15:45,536
my search just into that

538
00:15:45,536 --> 0:15:46,396
Forecast Package.

539
00:15:47,446 --> 0:15:49,356
I'll search for observation, and

540
00:15:49,826 --> 0:15:50,976
I'll only get results for that

541
00:15:50,976 --> 0:15:51,416
package.

542
00:15:51,966 --> 0:15:53,196
And it looks like it's defined

543
00:15:53,276 --> 0:15:53,736
right here.

544
00:15:54,896 --> 0:15:57,316
OK. So this enum looks like it

545
00:15:57,316 --> 0:15:58,616
has different options for me,

546
00:15:58,616 --> 0:15:59,486
like the metrics that will come

547
00:15:59,486 --> 0:16:01,426
back from this API, like the

548
00:15:59,486 --> 0:16:01,426
back from this API, like the

549
00:16:01,426 --> 0:16:02,496
high temp, the low temp, the

550
00:16:02,496 --> 0:16:03,466
precipitation, and so on.

551
00:16:03,466 --> 0:16:05,016
I only want the high and low

552
00:16:05,016 --> 0:16:06,566
temp for my method, so I'll go

553
00:16:06,566 --> 0:16:07,156
and use those.

554
00:16:07,386 --> 0:16:09,216
And I'll use command shift J, to

555
00:16:09,216 --> 0:16:10,096
jump back to the project

556
00:16:10,096 --> 0:16:11,876
navigator, and navigate back to

557
00:16:11,876 --> 0:16:13,156
the Weather Fetcher here, and

558
00:16:13,156 --> 0:16:13,876
I'll start implementing this

559
00:16:13,876 --> 0:16:14,136
method.

560
00:16:15,086 --> 0:16:17,106
So, I'll use my Forecast Object.

561
00:16:17,836 --> 0:16:19,066
I'll pass in the date that was

562
00:16:19,096 --> 0:16:19,976
passing to this method.

563
00:16:20,926 --> 0:16:22,276
And like I said before I want

564
00:16:22,276 --> 0:16:25,586
the high temp and the low temp.

565
00:16:26,656 --> 0:16:27,856
And I'll fill in my Completion

566
00:16:27,856 --> 0:16:29,966
Handler really quick, grabbing

567
00:16:29,966 --> 0:16:31,396
the high and low temp out of the

568
00:16:31,396 --> 0:16:33,416
results, and then calling the

569
00:16:33,416 --> 0:16:35,556
completion with high and low.

570
00:16:35,556 --> 0:16:38,116
I'll fill in the condition

571
00:16:38,116 --> 0:16:39,286
method in a very similar way,

572
00:16:39,506 --> 0:16:41,206
only grabbing the condition back

573
00:16:41,206 --> 0:16:43,286
from the results.

574
00:16:43,396 --> 0:16:44,996
Awesome. So, now when I build,

575
00:16:44,996 --> 0:16:46,846
and run, and review the results

576
00:16:46,846 --> 0:16:47,746
in the simulator, I should be

577
00:16:47,746 --> 0:16:49,436
able to navigate the Plan tab

578
00:16:50,306 --> 0:16:51,466
and see some weather information

579
00:16:51,996 --> 0:16:53,356
in my San Francisco trip.

580
00:16:53,626 --> 0:16:54,546
And it looks like I got the high

581
00:16:54,546 --> 0:16:56,176
and the low and the expected

582
00:16:56,176 --> 0:16:56,796
conditions.

583
00:16:57,336 --> 0:16:58,106
And it looks like it's going to

584
00:16:58,106 --> 0:16:58,926
rain right towards the end of my

585
00:16:58,926 --> 0:17:00,116
trip, so I should probably bring

586
00:16:58,926 --> 0:17:00,116
trip, so I should probably bring

587
00:17:00,116 --> 0:17:00,456
a jacket.

588
00:17:01,426 --> 0:17:04,066
It was that easy to configure a

589
00:17:04,066 --> 0:17:05,336
Swift Package dependency in my

590
00:17:05,336 --> 0:17:06,656

the Source Control menu where

you can quickly stash your

Yesterday you saw the

632
00:18:25,666 --> 0:18:27,336
introduction of a number of new

633
00:18:27,726 --> 0:18:29,496
OS features, and you can begin

634
00:18:29,496 --> 0:18:30,636
adopting those today.

635
00:18:32,386 --> 0:18:34,046
Once you bring your iPad app to

636
00:18:34,046 --> 0:18:34,416
the Mac.

637
00:18:35,276 --> 0:18:36,406
You can start customizing it

638
00:18:36,406 --> 0:18:38,526
using the new Mac device here in

639
00:18:38,526 --> 0:18:40,196
the Storyboards Devices bar,

640
00:18:41,396 --> 0:18:43,196
makes it quick and easy to make

641
00:18:43,196 --> 0:18:44,596
your app feel right at home on

642
00:18:44,596 --> 0:18:48,226
the Mac, and for the new iOS

643
00:18:48,286 --> 0:18:49,176
dark appearance.

644
00:18:49,496 --> 0:18:50,746
This system does a lot of the

645
00:18:50,746 --> 0:18:51,696
work for you.

646
00:18:52,476 --> 0:18:53,886
Again, using the devices bar you

647
00:18:53,886 --> 0:18:55,526
can quickly switch between light

648
00:18:55,526 --> 0:18:57,626
and dark and make sure that your

649
00:18:57,626 --> 0:18:58,916
app looks great.

650
00:18:59,506 --> 0:19:02,166
Now, all of the new SF symbols

651
00:18:59,506 --> 0:19:02,166
Now, all of the new SF symbols

652
00:19:02,276 --> 0:19:03,636
are fully integrated.

653
00:19:03,966 --> 0:19:05,436
The options you need are right

654
00:19:05,436 --> 0:19:06,886
here in the inspector, things

655
00:19:06,886 --> 0:19:08,456
like having the symbol size,

656
00:19:08,686 --> 0:19:10,126
track the system font size.

657
00:19:11,026 --> 0:19:12,336
And then when you want to browse

658
00:19:12,706 --> 0:19:14,156
all the symbols, you can do that

659
00:19:14,156 --> 0:19:16,376
in the redesigned library, and

660
00:19:16,376 --> 0:19:17,416
then drag them right out into

661
00:19:17,416 --> 0:19:18,006
your Storyboard.

662
00:19:18,586 --> 0:19:21,536
Now, for your own resources,

663
00:19:21,766 --> 0:19:24,056
things like colors, and images,

664
00:19:24,536 --> 0:19:26,176
Asset Catalogs, they play a

665
00:19:26,176 --> 0:19:27,626
really important role.

666
00:19:28,086 --> 0:19:29,786
They let you vary for things

667
00:19:29,786 --> 0:19:31,586
like device type and for light

668
00:19:31,826 --> 0:19:32,216
and dark.

669
00:19:33,286 --> 0:19:35,256
The best part is, you don't have

670
00:19:35,256 --> 0:19:38,356
to write any code to do that.

671
00:19:38,686 --> 0:19:41,726
In Xcode 11, in iOS 13, you can

672
00:19:41,726 --> 0:19:43,576
create your own custom symbols.

673
00:19:43,816 --> 0:19:44,946

674
00:19:44,946 --> 0:19:46,706
characteristics of the new SF

675
00:19:46,806 --> 0:19:47,456
Symbols.

676
00:19:48,346 --> 0:19:49,796
So, symbols, they let you

677
00:19:49,796 --> 0:19:51,416
specify various sizes and

678
00:19:51,416 --> 0:19:52,666
weights of artwork.

679
00:19:53,296 --> 0:19:55,226
And then at runtime, the system,

680
00:19:55,396 --> 0:19:57,016
it'll choose the right variant,

681
00:19:57,256 --> 0:19:58,676
based on things like the users'

682
00:19:58,676 --> 0:20:00,556
font size, accessibility

683
00:19:58,676 --> 0:20:00,556
font size, accessibility

684
00:20:00,556 --> 0:20:02,756

00:20:02,756 --> 0:20:04,356
used within the user interface.

686
00:20:05,086 --> 0:20:06,386
So this is a really powerful new

687
00:20:06,386 --> 0:20:08,236
way to create dynamic artwork.

00:21:02,406 --> 0:21:04,366
with dynamic type.

715
00:21:05,176 --> 0:21:06,996
When I browse the library

716
00:21:06,996 --> 0:21:08,556
earlier, there are two images

717
00:21:08,596 --> 0:21:09,616
that look nice to me.

718
00:21:10,086 --> 0:21:11,686
One is called envelope the other

719
00:21:11,686 --> 0:21:12,286
is lock.

So let's change to use them.

721
00:21:15,556 --> 0:21:17,516

722
00:21:17,516 --> 0:21:19,956

732
00:21:41,146 --> 0:21:42,876
So, I'm going to type envelope.

733
00:21:43,636 --> 0:21:45,246
Now it will show me a list of

00:21:45,246 --> 0:21:46,446
envelope with different

735
00:21:46,446 --> 0:21:47,116
appearances.

736
00:21:47,656 --> 0:21:49,216
I'm going to select

737
00:21:49,396 --> 0:21:51,716
envelope.fill, which looks good.

738
00:21:52,946 --> 0:21:54,476
And for the symbol

739
00:21:54,476 --> 0:21:56,406
configurations, I would like to

740
00:21:56,526 --> 0:21:58,536
set as font, so that they can

741
00:21:58,536 --> 0:21:59,816
work with dynamic type.

742
00:22:00,456 --> 0:22:03,096
I can also change the font size.

743
00:22:03,816 --> 0:22:05,176
Let's change to a bigger one.

744
00:22:05,446 --> 0:22:06,046
Title One.

745
00:22:06,636 --> 0:22:10,376
Next, I would like to do the

746
00:22:10,376 --> 0:22:11,986
same for the password icon.

747
00:22:12,706 --> 0:22:15,656
I'm going to type in lock and

748
00:22:15,656 --> 0:22:17,586
choose lock.fill which matches

749
00:22:17,586 --> 0:22:18,426
the style here.

750
00:22:19,576 --> 0:22:21,046
Again, I'll set the

751
00:22:21,046 --> 0:22:22,566
configuration as font.

752
00:22:23,126 --> 0:22:26,086
Next, I would like to take a

753
00:22:26,086 --> 0:22:27,766
look how my view looks in the

754
00:22:27,766 --> 0:22:28,416
Dark mode.

755
00:22:29,646 --> 0:22:31,836
From the devices bar there's a

756
00:22:31,836 --> 0:22:33,986
switch I can change from light

757
00:22:34,146 --> 0:22:35,946
to dark, let's do it.

758
00:22:36,386 --> 0:22:38,926
Now you can see the view has

759
00:22:38,966 --> 0:22:39,666
been updated.

760
00:22:40,776 --> 0:22:42,856
However, this image doesn't look

761
00:22:42,856 --> 0:22:43,076
right.

762
00:22:43,856 --> 0:22:45,396
The handle of my suitcase

763
00:22:45,396 --> 0:22:46,086
disappears.

764
00:22:46,776 --> 0:22:48,056
Let's figure out what happened.

765
00:22:48,976 --> 0:22:51,146
I'm switching back.

766
00:22:51,146 --> 0:22:52,336
Oh, I see.

767
00:22:52,716 --> 0:22:53,736
The handle is black.

768
00:22:54,266 --> 0:22:55,696
So, it doesn't show very well

769
00:22:55,696 --> 0:22:57,026
against the dark background.

770
00:22:57,976 --> 0:22:59,986
To fix that, I would like to

771
00:23:00,016 --> 0:23:01,776
provide a new variant for this

772
00:23:01,846 --> 0:23:03,406
image for the Dark mode.

773
00:23:04,186 --> 0:23:05,926
Luckily, I have a great designer

774
00:23:05,926 --> 0:23:06,376
named At.

775
00:23:07,136 --> 0:23:08,986
He has already created one image

776
00:23:08,986 --> 0:23:10,736
for me to use in dark.

777
00:23:11,286 --> 0:23:12,406
Let's change to use it.

778
00:23:12,406 --> 0:23:15,166
I'm going to select the image.

779
00:23:15,166 --> 0:23:18,036
And I can click this arrow.

780
00:23:18,766 --> 0:23:20,886
It will open this image into

781
00:23:20,916 --> 0:23:21,696
dark appearance.

782
00:23:22,416 --> 0:23:24,426
First, let's enable the dark

783
00:23:24,426 --> 0:23:25,016
appearance.

784
00:23:25,696 --> 0:23:27,806
And then I can drag in the

785
00:23:27,806 --> 0:23:32,486
image, created by At.

786
00:23:32,746 --> 0:23:34,356
Let's change by, up to the

787
00:23:34,446 --> 0:23:35,006
Storyboard.

788
00:23:36,346 --> 0:23:38,496
Now, you can see in Light mode,

789
00:23:38,616 --> 0:23:39,946
it is still using the original

790
00:23:40,016 --> 0:23:42,306
image as expected, but when I

791
00:23:42,306 --> 0:23:43,186
changed to Dark.

792
00:23:43,826 --> 0:23:45,516
Now the new image has been

793
00:23:45,516 --> 0:23:46,816
using, it's look good.

[ Applause ]

795
00:23:52,556 --> 0:23:54,996
But At is a perfectionist, he

796
00:23:54,996 --> 0:23:56,276
thought these two blue buttons,

797
00:23:56,336 --> 0:23:57,716
although they look good in Light

798
00:23:57,716 --> 0:23:59,626
that he feel it doesn't pop as

799
00:23:59,626 --> 0:24:01,536
much as he wants in Dark.

800
00:23:59,626 --> 0:24:01,536
much as he wants in Dark.

801
00:24:02,226 --> 0:24:04,026
So, instead, he wanted me to

802
00:24:04,026 --> 0:24:05,446
change to use a different color

803
00:24:05,476 --> 0:24:06,026
orange.

804
00:24:06,906 --> 0:24:08,166
Let's figure out how to do that.

805
00:24:08,166 --> 0:24:10,566
I'm going to select the button.

806
00:24:11,476 --> 0:24:13,816
And now, I can see the tint

807
00:24:13,816 --> 0:24:15,396
color is set to use a custom

808
00:24:15,396 --> 0:24:16,726
color called Button color.

809
00:24:17,706 --> 0:24:20,026
So to use a light in the Light

810
00:24:20,026 --> 0:24:21,896
mode, I would like continue to

811
00:24:21,896 --> 0:24:24,106
using the blue button, but

812
00:24:24,106 --> 0:24:25,826
actually in the Dark mode, I

813
00:24:25,826 --> 0:24:27,626
would like to change to use the

814
00:24:27,686 --> 0:24:30,306
orange color, just as easy as

815
00:24:30,306 --> 0:24:32,456
what I done for the image.

816
00:24:32,456 --> 0:24:34,436
I'm going to open in the

817
00:24:34,546 --> 0:24:36,526
inspector and enable the dark

818
00:24:36,526 --> 0:24:37,036
appearance.

819
00:24:37,756 --> 0:24:39,366
And for the dark appearance, I'm

820
00:24:39,496 --> 0:24:41,556
going to use orange color.

821
00:24:42,576 --> 0:24:44,186
Let's switch back.

822
00:24:45,296 --> 0:24:47,866
Cool. I do find these two-orange

823
00:24:47,916 --> 0:24:49,836
button pop more and look better

824
00:24:49,836 --> 0:24:50,116
now.

825
00:24:50,636 --> 0:24:52,996
Next, I would like to take a

826
00:24:52,996 --> 0:24:54,706

runtime.

828
00:24:55,016 --> 0:24:57,536
So, I'm going to build and run

829
00:24:57,696 --> 0:24:58,566
in a simulator.

830
00:25:04,416 --> 0:25:07,046
In Xcode 11, there's a new

831
00:25:07,046 --> 0:25:08,926
feature called Environment

832
00:25:09,046 --> 0:25:09,646
Overrides.

833
00:25:10,686 --> 0:25:12,976
It is located in the Debug bar.

834
00:25:13,886 --> 0:25:16,286
When I click it, it will show me

835
00:25:16,286 --> 0:25:18,286
a pop over that I can change

836
00:25:18,366 --> 0:25:19,846
different settings, such as

837
00:25:19,886 --> 0:25:21,316
system settings and

838
00:25:21,316 --> 0:25:22,486
accessibility settings.

839
00:25:23,476 --> 0:25:26,256
So, I can change the interface

840
00:25:26,256 --> 0:25:29,526
style from light to dark to see

841
00:25:29,776 --> 0:25:31,376
how my view got updated.

842
00:25:31,376 --> 0:25:33,706
I can set different

843
00:25:33,706 --> 0:25:36,766
accessibility settings, for

844
00:25:36,766 --> 0:25:39,846
example, the bold text.

845
00:25:40,456 --> 0:25:43,776
From this overrides, it allows

846
00:25:43,776 --> 0:25:46,386
me to test out my app at runtime

847
00:25:46,506 --> 0:25:47,736
with these different settings,

848
00:25:48,086 --> 0:25:49,706

00:25:49,706 --> 0:25:51,506
settings on my simulator or

850
00:25:51,506 --> 0:25:52,066

861
00:26:16,936 --> 0:26:18,436
that I used font for their

864
00:26:22,236 --> 0:26:24,436
set different dynamic type, they

865
00:26:24,436 --> 0:26:28,386
react to it, just like text.

And some of the scenarios that

876
00:26:46,136 --> 0:26:47,486
your users run into on their

877
00:26:47,486 --> 0:26:50,406
devices, things like networking

878
00:26:50,406 --> 0:26:51,666
or thermal conditions.

879
00:26:52,336 --> 0:26:53,616
Those are really hard to

880
00:26:53,616 --> 0:26:54,396
reproduce.

881
00:26:55,046 --> 0:26:56,606
And that makes them really hard

882
00:26:56,646 --> 0:26:59,226
to debug, well, in Xcode 11 you

883
00:26:59,276 --> 0:27:00,826
can change the way your device

884
00:26:59,276 --> 0:27:00,826
can change the way your device

885
00:27:00,926 --> 0:27:02,996
behaves, varying things like the

886
00:27:02,996 --> 0:27:05,676
network throughput, or changing

887
00:27:05,676 --> 0:27:07,156
the device's thermal state.

888
00:27:07,276 --> 0:27:10,226
In the devices window there's a

889
00:27:10,226 --> 0:27:12,006
new Device Condition section

890
00:27:12,516 --> 0:27:13,466
where you can turn on the

891
00:27:13,466 --> 0:27:15,576
Network Link Conditioner and

892
00:27:15,576 --> 0:27:17,166
simulate real world networking

893
00:27:17,256 --> 0:27:19,736
scenarios, or you can turn on

894
00:27:19,736 --> 0:27:20,806
the Thermal State Conditioner.

895
00:27:21,616 --> 0:27:22,696
Change your device's thermal

896
00:27:22,696 --> 0:27:24,246
state, so that it behaves like

897
00:27:24,246 --> 0:27:26,076
it's warmer than it actually is.

898
00:27:26,626 --> 0:27:28,096
And once you turn on one of

899
00:27:28,096 --> 0:27:29,776
these conditions, you'll see an

900
00:27:29,776 --> 0:27:32,036
indicator on your device, and

901
00:27:32,036 --> 0:27:33,736
you can tap that indicator to

902
00:27:33,736 --> 0:27:35,196
see exactly which condition is

903
00:27:35,246 --> 0:27:35,556
running.

904
00:27:36,426 --> 0:27:38,236
And you can stop it here, or

905
00:27:38,706 --> 0:27:40,036
when you disconnect from Xcode,

906
00:27:40,036 --> 0:27:41,596
it'll automatically be stopped

907
00:27:42,016 --> 0:27:42,376
for you.

908
00:27:43,126 --> 0:27:44,426
This is a great way to make sure

909
00:27:44,426 --> 0:27:46,186
that your apps perform really

910
00:27:46,186 --> 0:27:47,936
well in all conditions.

911
00:27:51,066 --> 0:27:53,186
Xcode 11 continues to improve

912
00:27:53,226 --> 0:27:55,096
testing this year with the

913
00:27:55,096 --> 0:27:56,696
introduction of test plans.

914
00:27:57,736 --> 0:27:59,766
Now test plans let you define a

915
00:27:59,766 --> 0:28:01,466
set of tests that you can share

916
00:27:59,766 --> 0:28:01,466
set of tests that you can share

917
00:28:01,466 --> 0:28:02,226
across schemes.

918
00:28:03,006 --> 0:28:04,396
A test plan can have any number

919
00:28:04,396 --> 0:28:06,336
of configurations that let you

920
00:28:06,336 --> 0:28:08,156
say what arguments do you want

921
00:28:08,156 --> 0:28:10,236
to pass or what environment

922
00:28:10,236 --> 0:28:11,456
variables do you want to say,

923
00:28:11,456 --> 0:28:13,196
even what sanitizers do you want

924
00:28:13,196 --> 0:28:13,616
to turn on?

925
00:28:14,506 --> 0:28:16,486
When you run that test plan, it

926
00:28:16,486 --> 0:28:18,236
runs all the tests in all the

927
00:28:18,236 --> 0:28:19,496
different configurations.

928
00:28:20,316 --> 0:28:21,836
So, for example, you can have a

929
00:28:21,836 --> 0:28:22,546
test plan that has

930
00:28:22,546 --> 0:28:24,516
configurations for each language

931
00:28:24,666 --> 0:28:25,736
your app supports.

932
00:28:26,356 --> 0:28:28,106
When you run that test plan, it

933
00:28:28,106 --> 0:28:29,866
runs all the tests in all the

934
00:28:29,866 --> 0:28:31,696
different languages, all with

935
00:28:31,696 --> 0:28:33,486
just a single action.

936
00:28:34,036 --> 0:28:35,926
And, of course, test plans, they

937
00:28:35,926 --> 0:28:37,186
work great with the Xcode's

938
00:28:37,186 --> 0:28:38,766
server where you can run your

939
00:28:38,766 --> 0:28:40,806
tests on multiple devices and

940
00:28:40,856 --> 0:28:43,486
simulators, all in parallel, and

941
00:28:43,486 --> 0:28:45,516
now in more configurations than

942
00:28:45,516 --> 0:28:45,776
ever.

943
00:28:46,356 --> 0:28:48,466
And it goes without saying,

944
00:28:48,516 --> 0:28:50,696
testing, it works great for iPad

945
00:28:50,696 --> 0:28:52,676
apps on the Mac, as well as

946
00:28:52,736 --> 0:28:54,446
those built with SwiftUI.

947
00:28:55,316 --> 0:28:59,046
And that's testing.

957
00:29:21,466 --> 0:29:23,736
that the simulator is built on

00:29:39,276 --> 0:29:41,556
of Metal, like UIKit, well, that

968
00:29:41,556 --> 0:29:42,746
gets a whole lot faster too.

to 90% which is really great for

973
00:29:53,366 --> 0:29:55,486
battery life [applause].

974
00:29:55,486 --> 0:29:55,646
Yeah.

975
00:29:56,516 --> 0:29:59,726
[ Applause ]

976
00:30:00,226 --> 0:30:01,446
We didn't stop there though.

977
00:30:02,456 --> 0:30:04,916
Simulator Warm Boots are now up

978
00:30:04,916 --> 0:30:06,816
to twice as fast too.

979
00:30:07,516 --> 0:30:10,756
[ Applause ]

980
00:30:11,256 --> 0:30:12,276
So, big improvements to the

981
00:30:12,276 --> 0:30:12,776
simulator.

982
00:30:15,286 --> 0:30:16,866
Last year we introduced, OS

983
00:30:16,866 --> 0:30:18,296
Signposts and Custom

984
00:30:18,296 --> 0:30:19,936
Instruments, so that you can

985
00:30:19,936 --> 0:30:21,816
surface your own data up through

986
00:30:21,816 --> 0:30:22,526
the tools.

987
00:30:23,256 --> 0:30:25,206
Well, this year, we're bringing

988
00:30:25,206 --> 0:30:27,276
hierarchy to the tracks, to make

989
00:30:27,276 --> 0:30:29,166
it easier for you to explore and

990
00:30:29,166 --> 0:30:30,396
correlate data.

991
00:30:31,486 --> 0:30:33,076
But when you use OS Signposts

992
00:30:33,486 --> 0:30:35,756
each category that you log, will

993
00:30:35,756 --> 0:30:37,426
now get its own track, like

994
00:30:37,456 --> 0:30:37,556
this.

995
00:30:39,136 --> 0:30:41,466
Then you can pin that track and

996
00:30:41,566 --> 0:30:43,026
easily correlate it to another

997
00:30:43,026 --> 0:30:44,716
track, like CPU use.

998
00:30:46,236 --> 0:30:47,406
We're also introducing a new

999
00:30:47,406 --> 0:30:49,956
template for SwiftUI to give you

1000
00:30:49,956 --> 0:30:51,386
insight into how much time

1001
00:30:51,386 --> 0:30:52,656
you're spending building your

1002
00:30:52,656 --> 0:30:54,736
user interfaces in the new body

1003
00:30:54,736 --> 0:30:55,306
methods.

1004
00:30:56,556 --> 0:30:58,506
And we've completely rewritten

1005
00:30:58,506 --> 0:30:59,996
the Metal System Trace Template

1006
00:31:00,066 --> 0:31:01,356
from the ground up.

1007
00:31:02,666 --> 0:31:03,666
It takes advantage of the new

1008
00:31:03,666 --> 0:31:05,406
hierarchical tracks and it's

1009
00:31:05,406 --> 0:31:08,656
significantly faster, up to 10

1010
00:31:08,926 --> 0:31:09,996
times faster.

1011
00:31:10,666 --> 0:31:16,216
Now, we can't finish up here

1012
00:31:16,216 --> 0:31:18,086
today without talking about

1013
00:31:18,226 --> 0:31:20,436
SwiftUI, which really is an

1014
00:31:20,436 --> 0:31:23,116
amazing new way to build user

1015
00:31:23,116 --> 0:31:23,946
interfaces.

1016
00:31:25,296 --> 0:31:27,376
SwiftUI makes it seamless to

1017
00:31:27,376 --> 0:31:30,616
move from editing to running to

1018
00:31:30,616 --> 0:31:31,296
debugging.

1019
00:31:32,266 --> 0:31:34,806
The new previews which show you

1020
00:31:34,806 --> 0:31:36,496
your real UI, they make these

1021
00:31:36,556 --> 0:31:39,466
three things, just a single

1022
00:31:39,466 --> 0:31:40,126
activity.

1023
00:31:41,396 --> 0:31:44,356
Editing, when we see this is the

1024
00:31:44,356 --> 0:31:45,646
future of UI development.

1025
00:31:46,226 --> 0:31:49,936
So, from the new Preview mode to

1026
00:31:49,936 --> 0:31:51,406
the inline editors, we've

1027
00:31:51,406 --> 0:31:53,956
rethought how to build UI code.

1028
00:31:54,546 --> 0:31:55,886
And we've done that with an eye

1029
00:31:55,886 --> 0:31:57,586
towards efficiency and direct

1030
00:31:57,586 --> 0:31:59,716
manipulation, so that you can

1031
00:31:59,716 --> 0:32:01,866
write more code without ever

1032
00:31:59,716 --> 0:32:01,866
write more code without ever

1033
00:32:01,866 --> 0:32:02,926
typing a character.

1034
00:32:03,576 --> 0:32:05,486
And there's a brand-new

1035
00:32:05,486 --> 0:32:07,306
documentation experience to go

1036
00:32:07,306 --> 0:32:07,686
with it.

1037
00:32:07,896 --> 0:32:09,156
And that's going to get you up

1038
00:32:09,156 --> 0:32:11,026
and writing code quickly.

1039
00:32:11,576 --> 0:32:13,366
There are great new tutorials,

1040
00:32:13,996 --> 0:32:16,346
all which guide and teach you,

1041
00:32:16,346 --> 0:32:18,386
while helping you write code.

1042
00:32:19,046 --> 0:32:21,926
Now, you don't need to create a

1043
00:32:21,926 --> 0:32:23,306
new project to get started with

1044
00:32:23,306 --> 0:32:24,996
previews, you can use them right

1045
00:32:25,076 --> 0:32:27,636
in your existing apps, just

1046
00:32:27,636 --> 0:32:28,196
implement the new

1047
00:32:28,196 --> 0:32:31,026
UIViewRepresentable protocol and

1048
00:32:31,026 --> 0:32:32,396
hand back one of your own views.

1049
00:32:32,396 --> 0:32:33,836
It's really that easy.

1050
00:32:35,166 --> 0:32:36,576
So, whether you have an iOS,

1051
00:32:36,576 --> 0:32:40,016
macOS, watchOS, or tvOS app, you

1052
00:32:40,166 --> 0:32:41,896
can get started today.

1053
00:32:41,896 --> 0:32:45,406
Well, that is a look at Xcode

1054
00:32:45,406 --> 0:32:45,906
11.

1055
00:32:46,366 --> 0:32:47,306
Thank you very much.

1056
00:32:47,756 --> 0:32:48,786
Have a great conference.
