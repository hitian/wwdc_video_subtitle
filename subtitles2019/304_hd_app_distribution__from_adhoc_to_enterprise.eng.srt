3
00:00:17,046 --> 0:00:18,706
&gt;&gt; Hello. My name is Ashley

4
00:00:18,706 --> 0:00:20,346
Carroll, and I'm a consulting

5
00:00:20,346 --> 0:00:21,796
engineer from New York focused

6
00:00:21,796 --> 0:00:22,626
on app development.

7
00:00:23,376 --> 0:00:24,926
I spend my time working with our

8
00:00:24,926 --> 0:00:26,556
largest business, government,

9
00:00:26,856 --> 0:00:28,306
and education customers, helping

10
00:00:28,306 --> 0:00:30,536
them build and distribute great

11
00:00:30,696 --> 0:00:31,536
apps for their employees.

12
00:00:32,366 --> 0:00:34,336
Welcome to App Distribution From

13
00:00:34,446 --> 0:00:35,206
Ad Hoc to Eenterprise.

14
00:00:35,906 --> 0:00:37,326
So who here in the room today

15
00:00:37,326 --> 0:00:38,576
has had to distribute an app

16
00:00:38,706 --> 0:00:39,046
before?

17
00:00:39,906 --> 0:00:41,556
Just a few hands, right.

18
00:00:41,696 --> 0:00:42,736
You're in the right place.

19
00:00:42,736 --> 0:00:44,116
So, pretty much everyone has had

20
00:00:44,116 --> 0:00:46,056
to do this, and whether you're

21
00:00:46,056 --> 0:00:48,106
building apps for the App Store

22
00:00:48,426 --> 0:00:50,036
or focusing on building

23
00:00:50,036 --> 0:00:52,116
customized private apps for

24
00:00:52,116 --> 0:00:53,576
business or enterprise, you

25
00:00:53,576 --> 0:00:54,466
should learn something today.

26
00:00:54,466 --> 0:00:57,686
I want to begin by taking a step

27
00:00:57,736 --> 0:00:59,106
back from app distribution and

28
00:00:59,376 --> 0:01:00,866
talk about the life cycle of an

29
00:00:59,376 --> 0:01:00,866
talk about the life cycle of an

30
00:01:00,866 --> 0:01:01,836
app from its earliest

31
00:01:01,836 --> 0:01:02,456
beginnings.

32
00:01:03,016 --> 0:01:04,355
Most of us probably know this

33
00:01:04,396 --> 0:01:06,146
part of the process inside and

34
00:01:06,146 --> 0:01:06,316
out.

35
00:01:06,866 --> 0:01:08,326
It all starts with an idea for a

36
00:01:08,326 --> 0:01:09,506
problem that you want to solve.

37
00:01:10,276 --> 0:01:11,406
You figure out what to build.

38
00:01:11,686 --> 0:01:13,236
You create a great app, and it

39
00:01:13,236 --> 0:01:14,356
makes it into the hands of your

40
00:01:14,356 --> 0:01:17,106
users, most often through the

41
00:01:17,706 --> 0:01:18,496
App Store.

42
00:01:18,726 --> 0:01:20,606
Today, we'll be focusing on that

43
00:01:20,606 --> 0:01:23,156
last bit, how users actually get

44
00:01:23,156 --> 0:01:25,106
your app onto their devices.

45
00:01:26,206 --> 0:01:28,296
It seems simple, and for lots of

46
00:01:28,296 --> 0:01:29,826
apps on the store, it is.

47
00:01:30,236 --> 0:01:31,486
But there's actually a number of

48
00:01:31,486 --> 0:01:32,606
different ways that you can

49
00:01:32,606 --> 0:01:33,986
distribute an app.

50
00:01:35,126 --> 0:01:36,506
And that depends on who your

51
00:01:36,506 --> 0:01:37,866
customer is.

52
00:01:38,496 --> 0:01:40,556
This is all about finding the

53
00:01:40,556 --> 0:01:42,186
right way to reach your users.

54
00:01:42,746 --> 0:01:43,886
Your users could be the general

55
00:01:43,946 --> 0:01:45,756
public or business and education

56
00:01:45,756 --> 0:01:46,286
customers.

57
00:01:46,846 --> 0:01:48,036
Depending on who your app is

58
00:01:48,036 --> 0:01:49,786
for, there are different ways to

59
00:01:49,786 --> 0:01:50,396
distribute it.

60
00:01:51,316 --> 0:01:52,426
There are four distribution

61
00:01:52,426 --> 0:01:53,136
methods that we're going to

62
00:01:53,136 --> 0:01:53,526
cover today.

63
00:01:53,526 --> 0:01:57,756
Ad hoc, App Store, in-house, and

64
00:01:57,756 --> 0:01:58,356
custom apps.

65
00:01:59,236 --> 0:02:00,386
How do you determine which path

66
00:01:59,236 --> 0:02:00,386
How do you determine which path

67
00:02:00,646 --> 0:02:02,626
is the most appropriate for you?

68
00:02:03,796 --> 0:02:05,206
This depends on a number of

69
00:02:05,206 --> 0:02:07,186
factors, and some questions you

70
00:02:07,186 --> 0:02:09,136
might ask along the way include

71
00:02:09,136 --> 0:02:10,866
who's the audience for this app.

72
00:02:11,676 --> 0:02:13,436
Who's going to maintain the

73
00:02:13,436 --> 0:02:13,976
source code?

74
00:02:14,736 --> 0:02:16,156
Are you building the app for you

75
00:02:16,156 --> 0:02:17,176
or for someone else?

76
00:02:18,016 --> 0:02:19,076
Is someone buying this app for

77
00:02:19,116 --> 0:02:20,256
their employees or students to

78
00:02:20,256 --> 0:02:20,566
use?

79
00:02:21,856 --> 0:02:23,536
All of this comes down to asking

80
00:02:23,536 --> 0:02:25,626
who, and we can focus that on

81
00:02:25,696 --> 0:02:27,446
who was using the app and who is

82
00:02:27,446 --> 0:02:27,936
buying the app.

83
00:02:32,436 --> 0:02:33,876
Knowing that the customer and

84
00:02:33,876 --> 0:02:35,496
the user are not always the same

85
00:02:35,496 --> 0:02:37,296
person or entity is critical to

86
00:02:37,326 --> 0:02:38,756
mastering the different ways

87
00:02:38,756 --> 0:02:40,086
that apps can be distributed and

88
00:02:40,376 --> 0:02:41,456
figuring out where your app

89
00:02:41,666 --> 0:02:42,006
fits.

90
00:02:42,826 --> 0:02:43,886
If you can identify your

91
00:02:43,886 --> 0:02:45,386
audience, it becomes a lot

92
00:02:45,386 --> 0:02:46,636
easier to pick the right

93
00:02:46,636 --> 0:02:47,786
distribution mechanism.

94
00:02:48,306 --> 0:02:50,176
Most often, an individual is the

95
00:02:50,176 --> 0:02:51,606
both the customer and the user.

96
00:02:52,226 --> 0:02:53,256
They download your app from the

97
00:02:53,256 --> 0:02:55,006
App Store on their own device

98
00:02:55,006 --> 0:02:56,066
and then use it themselves.

99
00:02:57,256 --> 0:02:58,696
Ad hoc distribution lets you

100
00:02:58,696 --> 0:03:00,226
distribute to a limited number

101
00:02:58,696 --> 0:03:00,226
distribute to a limited number

102
00:03:00,626 --> 0:03:02,586
of devices that you choose for

103
00:03:02,586 --> 0:03:04,726
testing, and the App Store lets

104
00:03:04,726 --> 0:03:05,676
you distribute apps to the

105
00:03:05,676 --> 0:03:06,436
general public.

106
00:03:07,586 --> 0:03:09,646
Now, sometimes when dealing with

107
00:03:09,646 --> 0:03:10,816
the business and education

108
00:03:10,816 --> 0:03:13,186
market, the customer is actually

109
00:03:13,186 --> 0:03:14,876
an organization, and they're

110
00:03:14,946 --> 0:03:16,706
purchasing apps on behalf of a

111
00:03:16,706 --> 0:03:18,646
group of users who will use

112
00:03:18,646 --> 0:03:20,346
those apps on either devices

113
00:03:20,396 --> 0:03:21,936
that that organization provides

114
00:03:22,006 --> 0:03:24,216
to them or on their own devices.

115
00:03:24,806 --> 0:03:28,576
So there are two different ways

116
00:03:28,646 --> 0:03:29,916
that you can distribute apps in

117
00:03:29,916 --> 0:03:31,366
this scenario, in house and

118
00:03:31,366 --> 0:03:33,256
custom apps, and those both let

119
00:03:33,256 --> 0:03:35,926
you distribute apps privately to

120
00:03:35,926 --> 0:03:36,626
organizations.

121
00:03:37,356 --> 0:03:40,396
Your app might have different

122
00:03:40,396 --> 0:03:41,746
reasons to use all of these

123
00:03:41,746 --> 0:03:42,756
distribution methods at

124
00:03:42,756 --> 0:03:44,436
different times in its lifetime

125
00:03:44,776 --> 0:03:46,156
or simply live in one of them,

126
00:03:46,646 --> 0:03:47,736
and different distribution

127
00:03:47,736 --> 0:03:49,466
mechanisms are associated with

128
00:03:49,466 --> 0:03:51,316
different types of memberships

129
00:03:51,316 --> 0:03:52,686
in the Apple developer programs.

130
00:03:54,076 --> 0:03:55,686
We're going to walk through each

131
00:03:55,686 --> 0:03:57,146
of these distribution methods

132
00:03:57,146 --> 0:03:57,476
today.

133
00:03:58,296 --> 0:04:00,466
The expectations around each and

134
00:03:58,296 --> 0:04:00,466
The expectations around each and

135
00:04:00,466 --> 0:04:01,886
everything that you need to know

136
00:04:02,076 --> 0:04:04,246
to figure out where your app

137
00:04:05,786 --> 0:04:05,936
fits.

138
00:04:06,116 --> 0:04:07,416
We'll do this by following an

139
00:04:07,416 --> 0:04:08,896
app on a distribution journey

140
00:04:09,416 --> 0:04:10,716
from its very beginnings as a

141
00:04:10,756 --> 0:04:12,136
prototype, through the App

142
00:04:12,346 --> 0:04:13,906
Store, and through being

143
00:04:13,906 --> 0:04:15,536
customized for a business to be

144
00:04:15,536 --> 0:04:17,305
distributed privately in a few

145
00:04:17,305 --> 0:04:17,995
different ways.

146
00:04:19,505 --> 0:04:21,305
That app is LunchControl.

147
00:04:22,055 --> 0:04:23,646
LunchControl is an app for

148
00:04:23,646 --> 0:04:24,906
collaborative food ordering, and

149
00:04:25,306 --> 0:04:26,396
when we're talking about

150
00:04:26,396 --> 0:04:28,306
LunchControl, I want you to

151
00:04:28,306 --> 0:04:30,076
imagine yourself as the

152
00:04:30,076 --> 0:04:30,926
developer for this app.

153
00:04:31,926 --> 0:04:33,076
We'll begin with how

154
00:04:33,076 --> 0:04:34,606
LunchControl came to be.

155
00:04:35,606 --> 0:04:37,586
This whole journey starts with

156
00:04:37,586 --> 0:04:38,686
ordering lunch at the office.

157
00:04:39,396 --> 0:04:40,826
Everyone loves to get takeout,

158
00:04:40,986 --> 0:04:43,156
but the process for ordering and

159
00:04:44,196 --> 0:04:45,386
for a big group of people is

160
00:04:45,386 --> 0:04:46,556
daunting and time consuming.

161
00:04:46,556 --> 0:04:47,966
You have to figure out what

162
00:04:47,966 --> 0:04:49,896
everyone wants to eat and go

163
00:04:49,896 --> 0:04:50,826
through each of the orders to

164
00:04:50,826 --> 0:04:52,386
make a consolidated list.

165
00:04:52,866 --> 0:04:54,576
So, make sure you remember that

166
00:04:54,576 --> 0:04:55,796
Trevor doesn't like tomatoes,

167
00:04:56,316 --> 0:04:58,016
whatever your boss' usual is,

168
00:04:58,536 --> 0:05:00,816
and that the new guy, Rod was

169
00:04:58,536 --> 0:05:00,816
and that the new guy, Rod was

170
00:05:00,816 --> 0:05:02,726
it, said he wants a turkey club.

171
00:05:03,336 --> 0:05:04,236
Does this sound familiar to

172
00:05:04,296 --> 0:05:04,636
anyone?

173
00:05:05,526 --> 0:05:06,936
It takes way too long, so it's

174
00:05:06,936 --> 0:05:09,106
almost not worth ordering, and

175
00:05:09,106 --> 0:05:10,166
it really sounds like a great

176
00:05:10,166 --> 0:05:11,886
problem to solve with an app.

177
00:05:11,886 --> 0:05:13,146
So you give it a try, and you

178
00:05:13,146 --> 0:05:14,186
come up with a prototype.

179
00:05:15,436 --> 0:05:16,796
To build your prototype, you've

180
00:05:16,796 --> 0:05:18,546
downloaded Xcode, started

181
00:05:18,546 --> 0:05:20,076
exploring the SDK, and you've

182
00:05:20,076 --> 0:05:22,546
logged in using your Apple ID.

183
00:05:22,546 --> 0:05:23,836
I'm sure most of you know how to

184
00:05:23,836 --> 0:05:24,976
get started because you've

185
00:05:25,306 --> 0:05:26,496
probably already published apps

186
00:05:26,546 --> 0:05:27,986
to the store, but we're going to

187
00:05:27,986 --> 0:05:29,436
review this part of the process

188
00:05:30,116 --> 0:05:31,626
quickly, just so that everyone's

189
00:05:31,626 --> 0:05:32,896
on the same page, and you really

190
00:05:32,896 --> 0:05:34,346
get a full picture of app

191
00:05:34,476 --> 0:05:36,126
distribution from start to

192
00:05:36,126 --> 0:05:37,386
finish, and hopefully you'll

193
00:05:37,386 --> 0:05:39,416
learn something new along the

194
00:05:40,396 --> 0:05:40,496
way.

195
00:05:40,706 --> 0:05:41,556
This is your prototype.

196
00:05:42,336 --> 0:05:43,456
You can select items from the

197
00:05:43,456 --> 0:05:44,826
menu and create a group order.

198
00:05:45,476 --> 0:05:47,246
All of the items are nicely

199
00:05:47,246 --> 0:05:48,686
summarized, and it even breaks

200
00:05:48,686 --> 0:05:49,806
up the cost per person.

201
00:05:50,276 --> 0:05:51,486
But how would you actually get

202
00:05:51,486 --> 0:05:52,916
this prototype running on your

203
00:05:52,916 --> 0:05:53,496
devices?

204
00:05:54,786 --> 0:05:56,126
You can sign into Xcode with

205
00:05:56,126 --> 0:05:57,776
your Apple ID and leverage the

206
00:05:57,776 --> 0:05:59,146
free account that comes with it,

207
00:05:59,456 --> 0:06:00,566
called the Personal Team.

208
00:05:59,456 --> 0:06:00,566
called the Personal Team.

209
00:06:01,386 --> 0:06:02,936
This enables you to explore the

210
00:06:02,936 --> 0:06:04,366
SDK and test apps on your

211
00:06:04,366 --> 0:06:04,926
device.

212
00:06:05,466 --> 0:06:06,986
You can only deploy a limited

213
00:06:06,986 --> 0:06:08,556
number of apps to a few devices,

214
00:06:08,556 --> 0:06:10,476
and they expire after a few

215
00:06:10,476 --> 0:06:12,326
days, so this isn't a real

216
00:06:12,326 --> 0:06:14,006
distribution method.

217
00:06:15,296 --> 0:06:16,946
Here's what you see in Xcode

218
00:06:16,946 --> 0:06:17,856
once you're logged in with a

219
00:06:17,856 --> 0:06:18,706
personal team.

220
00:06:19,146 --> 0:06:20,656
You build and run your app.

221
00:06:20,656 --> 0:06:21,766
Xcode installs it on your

222
00:06:21,766 --> 0:06:23,076
device, but in order for it to

223
00:06:23,076 --> 0:06:24,666
be able to launch, you'll need

224
00:06:24,666 --> 0:06:25,696
to trust your developer

225
00:06:25,696 --> 0:06:27,136
certificate on your device.

226
00:06:28,066 --> 0:06:29,526
This is what that process looks

227
00:06:29,526 --> 0:06:29,786
like.

228
00:06:30,366 --> 0:06:31,406
You can trust the developer

229
00:06:31,406 --> 0:06:32,506
certificate by going into

230
00:06:32,506 --> 0:06:35,166
settings, general, profiles, and

231
00:06:35,166 --> 0:06:36,066
device management.

232
00:06:38,756 --> 0:06:40,686
Here are a few best practices to

233
00:06:40,686 --> 0:06:42,266
keep in mind for personal teams.

234
00:06:43,296 --> 0:06:45,056
These accounts are really meant

235
00:06:45,096 --> 0:06:45,686
for learning.

236
00:06:46,856 --> 0:06:47,806
The assumption is that you're

237
00:06:47,806 --> 0:06:50,626
going to be deploying to devices

238
00:06:50,626 --> 0:06:53,206
that you own, and this isn't for

239
00:06:53,206 --> 0:06:54,896
distribution beyond your own

240
00:06:54,896 --> 0:06:55,546
devices.

241
00:06:56,276 --> 0:06:58,266
Some capabilities like CloudKit,

242
00:06:58,656 --> 0:07:00,796
Siri, or APNS aren't available,

243
00:06:58,656 --> 0:07:00,796
Siri, or APNS aren't available,

244
00:07:01,276 --> 0:07:02,426
and there's no way to publish

245
00:07:02,426 --> 0:07:03,456
apps to the store with this

246
00:07:03,506 --> 0:07:05,416
program or debate a testing with

247
00:07:05,416 --> 0:07:06,166
other users.

248
00:07:06,776 --> 0:07:09,246
The goal for LunchControl is to

249
00:07:09,246 --> 0:07:10,686
go beyond this learning stage.

250
00:07:11,226 --> 0:07:12,906
So, let's talk about the first

251
00:07:12,906 --> 0:07:13,996
way that you can distribute

252
00:07:13,996 --> 0:07:14,626
LunchControl.

253
00:07:15,476 --> 0:07:17,096
Ad hoc distribution can be

254
00:07:17,096 --> 0:07:18,526
utilized to distribute apps for

255
00:07:18,526 --> 0:07:19,026
testing.

256
00:07:19,616 --> 0:07:23,116
Up until this point, you've been

257
00:07:23,116 --> 0:07:24,466
walking around to different

258
00:07:24,466 --> 0:07:25,726
people's desks to take their

259
00:07:25,726 --> 0:07:27,646
orders and mostly just testing

260
00:07:27,646 --> 0:07:28,986
the app in the simulator and on

261
00:07:28,986 --> 0:07:29,606
your own device.

262
00:07:30,256 --> 0:07:31,406
You're really ready to have a

263
00:07:31,466 --> 0:07:33,236
few friends try it out and get

264
00:07:33,236 --> 0:07:34,216
feedback and see if you've got

265
00:07:34,216 --> 0:07:36,286
something special, and you also

266
00:07:36,286 --> 0:07:37,776
think that integrating with Siri

267
00:07:37,776 --> 0:07:39,036
and push notifications would

268
00:07:39,036 --> 0:07:40,466
make the experience even better,

269
00:07:41,806 --> 0:07:43,106
which aren't available with

270
00:07:43,106 --> 0:07:43,926
personal teams.

271
00:07:45,256 --> 0:07:46,416
Membership in the Apple

272
00:07:46,416 --> 0:07:48,076
Developer Program is required in

273
00:07:48,076 --> 0:07:49,306
order to distribute an app to

274
00:07:49,306 --> 0:07:49,666
others.

275
00:07:50,146 --> 0:07:51,926
So, this is the point where if

276
00:07:51,926 --> 0:07:53,726
you don't already have an

277
00:07:53,726 --> 0:07:54,836
account, most developers would

278
00:07:54,836 --> 0:07:56,736
sign up, either as a company or

279
00:07:56,736 --> 0:07:58,726
an individual, and once you're

280
00:07:59,326 --> 0:08:00,596
signed up, you're ready to start

281
00:07:59,326 --> 0:08:00,596
signed up, you're ready to start

282
00:08:00,596 --> 0:08:04,286
distributing to others.

283
00:08:04,496 --> 0:08:05,556
When you leverage ad hoc

284
00:08:05,556 --> 0:08:07,376
distribution, a limited number

285
00:08:07,376 --> 0:08:08,736
of users can install your app

286
00:08:09,196 --> 0:08:10,446
directly from their devices for

287
00:08:10,446 --> 0:08:10,946
testing.

288
00:08:11,556 --> 0:08:13,176
The process requires that you

289
00:08:13,176 --> 0:08:14,676
register their device from the

290
00:08:14,676 --> 0:08:16,326
developer website, and there are

291
00:08:16,326 --> 0:08:17,626
a limited number of devices that

292
00:08:17,626 --> 0:08:18,766
you can register for both

293
00:08:18,766 --> 0:08:19,966
development and testing.

294
00:08:21,236 --> 0:08:23,176
That's 100 devices per product

295
00:08:23,176 --> 0:08:24,136
family per year.

296
00:08:26,316 --> 0:08:27,396
For your average user,

297
00:08:27,706 --> 0:08:29,396
registering a device involves

298
00:08:29,396 --> 0:08:30,626
connecting it to a Mac and

299
00:08:30,626 --> 0:08:32,126
getting the device identifier,

300
00:08:32,486 --> 0:08:33,946
either from the finder's sidebar

301
00:08:34,366 --> 0:08:35,936
or retrieving it from Xcode,

302
00:08:36,015 --> 0:08:37,015
which means that you as a

303
00:08:37,015 --> 0:08:38,236
developer would need physical

304
00:08:38,236 --> 0:08:39,436
possession of their device.

305
00:08:40,056 --> 0:08:42,806
You then take that identifier

306
00:08:42,806 --> 0:08:43,956
and add it to the Apple

307
00:08:43,956 --> 0:08:45,716
developer website, and once you

308
00:08:45,716 --> 0:08:47,016
have their device registered,

309
00:08:47,496 --> 0:08:48,946
you're ready to create a build

310
00:08:48,946 --> 0:08:51,176
and install it for them.

311
00:08:51,386 --> 0:08:52,356
There are several different

312
00:08:52,356 --> 0:08:53,756
alternatives for installing ad

313
00:08:53,756 --> 0:08:54,866
hoc builds for testers.

314
00:08:55,516 --> 0:08:56,616
You can tether the device to

315
00:08:56,616 --> 0:08:58,656
your Mac and install with Xcode

316
00:08:58,866 --> 0:09:00,286
or Apple configurator, which is

317
00:08:58,866 --> 0:09:00,286
or Apple configurator, which is

318
00:09:00,286 --> 0:09:01,486
available on the Mac App Store,

319
00:09:02,006 --> 0:09:03,166
or you can host the app

320
00:09:03,166 --> 0:09:04,546
somewhere and enable

321
00:09:04,546 --> 0:09:05,596
over-the-air installation.

322
00:09:06,846 --> 0:09:08,216
This is a manual way of

323
00:09:08,216 --> 0:09:10,026
achieving a limited distribution

324
00:09:10,106 --> 0:09:11,036
to a small group.

325
00:09:13,696 --> 0:09:15,646
This program is designed to let

326
00:09:15,646 --> 0:09:17,356
you deploy to registered devices

327
00:09:17,356 --> 0:09:18,446
for the purpose of testing.

328
00:09:19,186 --> 0:09:21,216
It's not a long-term or scalable

329
00:09:21,216 --> 0:09:23,126
distribution solution, and the

330
00:09:23,126 --> 0:09:24,596
provisioning profiles used to

331
00:09:24,596 --> 0:09:26,316
sign these apps expire yearly,

332
00:09:26,686 --> 0:09:28,196
so eventually the apps will stop

333
00:09:28,196 --> 0:09:30,066
working or need to be re-signed.

334
00:09:31,106 --> 0:09:32,916
For larger teams, it's really

335
00:09:32,916 --> 0:09:33,886
important to take note of the

336
00:09:33,886 --> 0:09:34,586
device limits.

337
00:09:35,146 --> 0:09:36,586
It can be hard to develop for

338
00:09:36,586 --> 0:09:38,406
new products if you run out of

339
00:09:38,406 --> 0:09:39,986
devices, which is why you have

340
00:09:39,986 --> 0:09:41,096
to be careful when using

341
00:09:41,256 --> 0:09:43,176
development devices for testers.

342
00:09:43,876 --> 0:09:45,346
These device limits are reset

343
00:09:45,346 --> 0:09:47,266
once per year, and if you're

344
00:09:47,266 --> 0:09:48,716
curious about when your device

345
00:09:48,716 --> 0:09:50,076
counts are going to be reset for

346
00:09:50,076 --> 0:09:51,206
your account, you can go to the

347
00:09:51,206 --> 0:09:52,296
member page on the developer

348
00:09:52,296 --> 0:09:54,136
website and look at the reset

349
00:09:54,166 --> 0:09:54,376
date.

350
00:09:54,896 --> 0:09:58,976
Ad hoc distribution gave us the

351
00:09:58,976 --> 0:10:00,236
ability to test with a few

352
00:09:58,976 --> 0:10:00,236
ability to test with a few

353
00:10:00,236 --> 0:10:00,726
users.

354
00:10:01,706 --> 0:10:03,446
You quickly realize that ad hoc

355
00:10:03,446 --> 0:10:04,956
distribution isn't scalable as

356
00:10:04,956 --> 0:10:05,986
the number of people who want to

357
00:10:05,986 --> 0:10:07,096
test the app grows.

358
00:10:07,616 --> 0:10:08,906
So, let's talk about the App

359
00:10:08,946 --> 0:10:09,216
Store.

360
00:10:10,736 --> 0:10:12,426
The App Store offers a much

361
00:10:12,426 --> 0:10:13,796
better way to do beta testing

362
00:10:13,836 --> 0:10:15,016
for a large group of users.

363
00:10:15,876 --> 0:10:17,436
User interest in LunchControl is

364
00:10:17,436 --> 0:10:18,916
growing, and you want to expand

365
00:10:18,916 --> 0:10:20,086
your audience to include more

366
00:10:20,086 --> 0:10:20,706
testers.

367
00:10:22,756 --> 0:10:24,566
TestFlight makes it really easy

368
00:10:24,566 --> 0:10:26,146
for both developers and users to

369
00:10:26,146 --> 0:10:28,526
try out apps, and installation

370
00:10:28,526 --> 0:10:29,766
and updates are simple.

371
00:10:30,186 --> 0:10:31,586
You could scale up to 10,000

372
00:10:31,586 --> 0:10:32,046
testers.

373
00:10:32,806 --> 0:10:33,946
The builds last for three

374
00:10:33,946 --> 0:10:35,786
months, and for a user,

375
00:10:35,916 --> 0:10:37,526
installing an app is a familiar

376
00:10:37,526 --> 0:10:38,516
and simple process.

377
00:10:39,576 --> 0:10:40,956
TestFlight beta builds for

378
00:10:40,956 --> 0:10:42,596
external testers do go through

379
00:10:42,596 --> 0:10:43,146
app review.

380
00:10:43,756 --> 0:10:44,796
So, you need to make sure that

381
00:10:44,796 --> 0:10:45,906
you're following the App Store

382
00:10:45,906 --> 0:10:46,936
review guidelines before

383
00:10:46,936 --> 0:10:48,656
submitting, and the app needs to

384
00:10:48,736 --> 0:10:50,066
be stable and ready for a

385
00:10:50,066 --> 0:10:51,046
broader audience to test.

386
00:10:52,216 --> 0:10:53,276
However, if you're making a

387
00:10:53,276 --> 0:10:55,016
build available to only members

388
00:10:55,016 --> 0:10:56,546
of your App Store connect team,

389
00:10:57,086 --> 0:10:58,406
review isn't required.

390
00:10:58,896 --> 0:11:00,896
And TestFlight is only available

391
00:10:58,896 --> 0:11:00,896
And TestFlight is only available

392
00:11:00,896 --> 0:11:01,956
to members of the Apple

393
00:11:01,956 --> 0:11:02,876
Developer Program.

394
00:11:04,876 --> 0:11:06,726
TestFlight is built right into

395
00:11:06,726 --> 0:11:07,486
App Store Connect.

396
00:11:08,346 --> 0:11:09,506
For those of you who are only

397
00:11:09,556 --> 0:11:10,766
familiar with the Apple

398
00:11:10,766 --> 0:11:12,576
Developer Enterprise Program and

399
00:11:12,576 --> 0:11:13,836
have probably never used App

400
00:11:13,836 --> 0:11:15,396
Store Connect before, this is

401
00:11:15,396 --> 0:11:16,016
what it looks like.

402
00:11:16,716 --> 0:11:18,446
App Store Connect enables you to

403
00:11:18,446 --> 0:11:20,086
easily upload, submit, and

404
00:11:20,086 --> 0:11:21,936
manage your apps on the App

405
00:11:22,026 --> 0:11:22,286
Store.

406
00:11:22,916 --> 0:11:24,166
All of your TestFlight builds

407
00:11:24,166 --> 0:11:25,966
are available to see here, and

408
00:11:25,966 --> 0:11:27,366
you can invite testers to test

409
00:11:27,366 --> 0:11:28,736
your app.

410
00:11:28,736 --> 0:11:29,846
Testers can install your app

411
00:11:30,066 --> 0:11:31,456
from the TesFlight app on their

412
00:11:31,456 --> 0:11:32,076
devices.

413
00:11:32,556 --> 0:11:35,606
Once you invite a tester in

414
00:11:35,606 --> 0:11:37,086
TestFlight, they will receive an

415
00:11:37,086 --> 0:11:38,596
email invitation to beta test

416
00:11:38,596 --> 0:11:39,816
your app.

417
00:11:40,276 --> 0:11:41,266
They can review all of the

418
00:11:41,266 --> 0:11:42,786
testing details that you provide

419
00:11:43,236 --> 0:11:44,506
and install the app to start

420
00:11:44,506 --> 0:11:47,686
testing right away.

421
00:11:47,906 --> 0:11:49,096
Once you're satisfied with the

422
00:11:49,096 --> 0:11:50,686
stability of your built, the

423
00:11:50,686 --> 0:11:52,516
next step is submitting to the

424
00:11:53,156 --> 0:11:53,936
App Store.

425
00:11:54,076 --> 0:11:55,886
For LunchControl, you've made

426
00:11:55,886 --> 0:11:57,696
some updates, added features

427
00:11:57,696 --> 0:11:59,016
based on feedback from your beta

428
00:11:59,016 --> 0:12:00,836
testers, and really iterated on

429
00:11:59,016 --> 0:12:00,836
testers, and really iterated on

430
00:12:00,836 --> 0:12:01,376
your design.

431
00:12:02,006 --> 0:12:03,156
You're ready to list the app for

432
00:12:03,156 --> 0:12:04,906
sale, and you've even updated

433
00:12:05,076 --> 0:12:08,536
your app icon.

434
00:12:08,726 --> 0:12:10,236
You've done the hard work to get

435
00:12:10,236 --> 0:12:11,436
your app ready for submission.

436
00:12:12,446 --> 0:12:14,546
Let's consider who the user and

437
00:12:14,546 --> 0:12:15,686
who the customer is here.

438
00:12:16,386 --> 0:12:17,946
Both are the general public,

439
00:12:18,016 --> 0:12:19,656
which makes this app appropriate

440
00:12:19,896 --> 0:12:21,076
for the public app store.

441
00:12:21,936 --> 0:12:23,806
Any individual can download and

442
00:12:23,806 --> 0:12:25,446
use your app, and the person who

443
00:12:25,446 --> 0:12:26,926
is buying it is also the person

444
00:12:26,926 --> 0:12:28,106
who's using it.

445
00:12:29,296 --> 0:12:30,956
Here are a few things you should

446
00:12:30,956 --> 0:12:32,326
know about how App Store

447
00:12:32,326 --> 0:12:33,266
distribution works.

448
00:12:34,626 --> 0:12:35,876
Both individuals and

449
00:12:35,876 --> 0:12:37,396
organizations can sign up for

450
00:12:37,396 --> 0:12:38,886
the Apple Developer Program to

451
00:12:38,886 --> 0:12:40,096
distribute to the App Store.

452
00:12:41,146 --> 0:12:42,526
Apps are available to the

453
00:12:42,526 --> 0:12:44,006
general public based on the

454
00:12:44,006 --> 0:12:45,056
markets that you choose to

455
00:12:45,106 --> 0:12:47,216
support, and the apps are hosted

456
00:12:47,216 --> 0:12:49,126
and reviewed by Apple.

457
00:12:50,436 --> 0:12:52,356
This means that developers are

458
00:12:52,356 --> 0:12:54,276
expected to know and follow the

459
00:12:54,276 --> 0:12:55,846
App Store review guidelines.

460
00:12:56,746 --> 0:12:58,546
It's also expected that you keep

461
00:12:58,546 --> 0:12:58,866
current.

462
00:12:59,706 --> 0:13:00,636
This means supporting new

463
00:12:59,706 --> 0:13:00,636
This means supporting new

464
00:13:00,676 --> 0:13:02,216
hardware and screen sizes,

465
00:13:02,566 --> 0:13:04,586
modern APIs, and new features,

466
00:13:04,586 --> 0:13:05,766
like all of the exciting things

467
00:13:05,766 --> 0:13:06,716
that we've announced this week.

468
00:13:07,616 --> 0:13:10,056
And just to reiterate, the App

469
00:13:10,056 --> 0:13:11,826
Store is appropriate for apps

470
00:13:12,076 --> 0:13:13,496
that are for the general public,

471
00:13:13,906 --> 0:13:14,816
which means that if you're

472
00:13:14,816 --> 0:13:15,616
building an app for the

473
00:13:15,616 --> 0:13:17,846
employees of a specific company

474
00:13:17,846 --> 0:13:19,936
to use, the public App Store is

475
00:13:19,936 --> 0:13:21,356
probably not the most

476
00:13:21,356 --> 0:13:22,446
appropriate place for it.

477
00:13:23,566 --> 0:13:25,036
Let's talk about a few more

478
00:13:25,036 --> 0:13:26,636
scenarios that developers might

479
00:13:26,636 --> 0:13:30,836
run into in the App Store.

480
00:13:31,036 --> 0:13:32,676
First, let's talk about the

481
00:13:32,676 --> 0:13:34,116
ability for a customer to

482
00:13:34,116 --> 0:13:35,966
purchase your app in bulk for a

483
00:13:35,966 --> 0:13:36,706
group of users.

484
00:13:37,446 --> 0:13:38,656
There are programs in place that

485
00:13:38,656 --> 0:13:41,186
enable you to do this.

486
00:13:41,336 --> 0:13:42,916
For LunchControl, a bunch of

487
00:13:42,916 --> 0:13:43,946
your friends are teachers at a

488
00:13:43,946 --> 0:13:45,546
local school, and their school

489
00:13:45,546 --> 0:13:47,056
wants to purchase the app in

490
00:13:47,056 --> 0:13:48,466
bulk for all of the faculty to

491
00:13:48,466 --> 0:13:48,856
use.

492
00:13:49,796 --> 0:13:51,626
As a developer, if you want to

493
00:13:51,626 --> 0:13:53,196
offer them a discount, you need

494
00:13:53,196 --> 0:13:54,166
to make sure that this is

495
00:13:54,166 --> 0:13:55,296
enabled in App Store Connect.

496
00:13:55,476 --> 0:13:58,556
In this case, your user is still

497
00:13:58,556 --> 0:13:59,326
the general public.

498
00:13:59,326 --> 0:14:00,716
So a group of teachers who would

499
00:13:59,326 --> 0:14:00,716
So a group of teachers who would

500
00:14:00,716 --> 0:14:02,416
be using your App Store app, but

501
00:14:02,416 --> 0:14:03,586
the customer that's doing the

502
00:14:03,626 --> 0:14:04,826
purchasing is actually the

503
00:14:04,826 --> 0:14:06,106
school that they're working for.

504
00:14:07,436 --> 0:14:09,556
Customers use Apple Business

505
00:14:09,556 --> 0:14:11,336
Manager or Apple School Manager

506
00:14:11,336 --> 0:14:12,366
to purchase apps like

507
00:14:12,366 --> 0:14:13,946
LunchControl from the App Store

508
00:14:13,946 --> 0:14:15,696
in bulk and distribute them to

509
00:14:15,696 --> 0:14:16,276
their users.

510
00:14:18,186 --> 0:14:20,006
To verify that an education

511
00:14:20,006 --> 0:14:22,006
customer can purchase your app

512
00:14:22,006 --> 0:14:23,596
at a discount, you would take a

513
00:14:23,596 --> 0:14:24,526
look at the pricing and

514
00:14:24,526 --> 0:14:25,986
availability section in App

515
00:14:25,986 --> 0:14:26,546
Store Connect.

516
00:14:27,776 --> 0:14:29,746
The default availability option

517
00:14:29,886 --> 0:14:32,006
for an app is available at a

518
00:14:32,006 --> 0:14:33,866
reduced price for educational

519
00:14:33,866 --> 0:14:34,596
institutions.

520
00:14:35,296 --> 0:14:36,866
If the educational institution

521
00:14:36,906 --> 0:14:38,766
purchases 20 or more licenses,

522
00:14:38,966 --> 0:14:40,106
and you have this enabled for

523
00:14:40,106 --> 0:14:40,376
them.

524
00:14:40,706 --> 0:14:41,966
They'll receive a 50 percent

525
00:14:41,966 --> 0:14:44,056
discount, and Apple School

526
00:14:44,056 --> 0:14:45,716
Manager is required for them to

527
00:14:45,716 --> 0:14:46,456
make this purchase.

528
00:14:46,456 --> 0:14:53,526
Next, I want to discuss proper

529
00:14:53,526 --> 0:14:55,316
versioning for an app and how to

530
00:14:55,436 --> 0:14:56,606
handle adding additional

531
00:14:56,666 --> 0:14:57,136
features.

532
00:14:58,556 --> 0:14:59,796
As LunchControl grows in

533
00:14:59,796 --> 0:15:01,796
popularity, more and more

534
00:14:59,796 --> 0:15:01,796
popularity, more and more

535
00:15:01,796 --> 0:15:03,616
feature requests are coming in,

536
00:15:03,986 --> 0:15:06,016
and more organizations start to

537
00:15:06,016 --> 0:15:07,066
become interested in leverage

538
00:15:07,066 --> 0:15:07,326
the app.

539
00:15:08,546 --> 0:15:10,756
Some users or organizations may

540
00:15:10,756 --> 0:15:12,786
ask you to add features that may

541
00:15:12,786 --> 0:15:14,016
not make sense for your entire

542
00:15:14,016 --> 0:15:16,226
audience, but you need to be

543
00:15:16,226 --> 0:15:17,426
careful about versioning your

544
00:15:17,426 --> 0:15:18,866
app in the app store

545
00:15:18,866 --> 0:15:19,596
appropriately.

546
00:15:20,796 --> 0:15:22,016
As you start to expand your

547
00:15:22,016 --> 0:15:23,446
customer base and consider

548
00:15:23,446 --> 0:15:24,696
offering multiple versions of

549
00:15:24,696 --> 0:15:26,416
your app on the store to various

550
00:15:26,416 --> 0:15:29,506
clients or even variations of

551
00:15:29,506 --> 0:15:30,766
your app for different types of

552
00:15:30,766 --> 0:15:33,546
users, like if having an admin

553
00:15:33,546 --> 0:15:34,836
and a regular version made sense

554
00:15:34,836 --> 0:15:36,586
for you, you want to handle

555
00:15:36,586 --> 0:15:37,866
versioning and your app store

556
00:15:37,866 --> 0:15:38,906
presence appropriately.

557
00:15:39,466 --> 0:15:42,216
This is what could happen if

558
00:15:42,216 --> 0:15:43,386
LunchControl doesn't manage

559
00:15:43,386 --> 0:15:44,256
their App Store presence

560
00:15:44,256 --> 0:15:44,806
properly.

561
00:15:45,306 --> 0:15:46,796
This is actually a real example

562
00:15:46,796 --> 0:15:48,586
from the App Store, just using

563
00:15:48,686 --> 0:15:50,096
the names from Liquid Oxygen

564
00:15:50,376 --> 0:15:51,796
Company and LunchControl.

565
00:15:52,436 --> 0:15:53,356
Don't do this.

566
00:15:54,026 --> 0:15:55,206
When a user searches the App

567
00:15:55,376 --> 0:15:57,076
Store for a given name, this is

568
00:15:57,076 --> 0:15:58,146
what they might see if you

569
00:15:58,146 --> 0:15:59,256
version your app this way.

570
00:16:00,046 --> 0:16:01,196
They have no idea which app to

571
00:16:01,196 --> 0:16:02,726
pick, and if they pick the wrong

572
00:16:02,726 --> 0:16:04,146
one, they might not be able to

573
00:16:04,146 --> 0:16:06,126
log in or use it and might not

574
00:16:06,126 --> 0:16:07,496
behave in a way that's expected.

575
00:16:07,956 --> 0:16:09,156
This is a really frustrating

576
00:16:09,156 --> 0:16:11,096
experience for a user, and it's

577
00:16:11,256 --> 0:16:12,976
easily overcome by managing your

578
00:16:12,976 --> 0:16:14,876
versions better in software and

579
00:16:14,876 --> 0:16:16,236
moving your customer base

580
00:16:16,266 --> 0:16:17,596
forward as you make changes to

581
00:16:17,596 --> 0:16:19,426
your app and your product.

582
00:16:20,016 --> 0:16:21,316
What developers should do

583
00:16:21,316 --> 0:16:23,036
instead is consolidate app

584
00:16:23,216 --> 0:16:24,936
versions as much as possible.

585
00:16:25,376 --> 0:16:27,666
Ideally, it's one app, just like

586
00:16:27,666 --> 0:16:28,436
you see here on the left.

587
00:16:29,386 --> 0:16:30,416
This does require more

588
00:16:30,416 --> 0:16:32,066
development work, but in the end

589
00:16:32,066 --> 0:16:33,196
it's a much better customer

590
00:16:33,196 --> 0:16:35,816
experience, and if you as a

591
00:16:35,816 --> 0:16:37,546
developer start getting requests

592
00:16:37,546 --> 0:16:39,146
for lots of different customized

593
00:16:39,146 --> 0:16:40,796
versions of your app, it might

594
00:16:40,796 --> 0:16:42,436
be a good time to talk about how

595
00:16:42,436 --> 0:16:43,776
you could deliver those versions

596
00:16:43,866 --> 0:16:45,576
privately using custom apps,

597
00:16:46,306 --> 0:16:47,436
which we'll get into in a few

598
00:16:47,436 --> 0:16:47,806
minutes.

599
00:16:48,436 --> 0:16:51,576
The final App Store scenario I

600
00:16:51,576 --> 0:16:53,546
want to cover is building an App

601
00:16:53,746 --> 0:16:55,246
Store app for someone else.

602
00:16:56,086 --> 0:16:58,186
Your company, Liquid Oxygen,

603
00:16:58,186 --> 0:17:00,396
LLC, might be approached by a

604
00:16:58,186 --> 0:17:00,396
LLC, might be approached by a

605
00:17:00,396 --> 0:17:01,936
customer to build their own

606
00:17:01,936 --> 0:17:02,676
public facing app.

607
00:17:03,626 --> 0:17:04,996
In this case, we're going to

608
00:17:04,996 --> 0:17:07,096
talk about Liquid Oxygen being

609
00:17:07,096 --> 0:17:08,236
approached by a restaurant

610
00:17:08,236 --> 0:17:11,406
chain, Taco Bar, to create their

611
00:17:11,406 --> 0:17:13,756
App Store app for them.

612
00:17:13,756 --> 0:17:15,346
Taco Bar loves what you've done

613
00:17:15,346 --> 0:17:16,896
with LunchControl and really

614
00:17:16,896 --> 0:17:17,876
wants you to build them an app

615
00:17:18,056 --> 0:17:19,195
where customers could place

616
00:17:19,266 --> 0:17:20,925
orders, find the Taco Bar

617
00:17:20,925 --> 0:17:23,366
locations near them, and pay for

618
00:17:23,366 --> 0:17:23,786
their food.

619
00:17:24,486 --> 0:17:25,675
They currently don't have an App

620
00:17:25,675 --> 0:17:27,195
Store presence, so this would be

621
00:17:27,195 --> 0:17:29,796
their flagship app, and you, as

622
00:17:29,796 --> 0:17:31,096
a developer, don't want to give

623
00:17:31,096 --> 0:17:32,386
Taco Bar your intellectual

624
00:17:32,436 --> 0:17:32,906
property.

625
00:17:33,606 --> 0:17:35,676
In this scenario, the user of

626
00:17:35,676 --> 0:17:37,176
your app is still the general

627
00:17:37,226 --> 0:17:38,866
public, and the customer is

628
00:17:38,866 --> 0:17:39,956
actually Taco Bar.

629
00:17:40,636 --> 0:17:41,916
You would be building an app for

630
00:17:41,916 --> 0:17:44,996
Taco Bar for their customers

631
00:17:45,386 --> 0:17:46,866
while still maintaining control

632
00:17:46,866 --> 0:17:48,266
of your intellectual property

633
00:17:48,856 --> 0:17:50,836
and running Liquid Oxygen, LLC.

634
00:17:51,696 --> 0:17:53,146
This is a brand-new app that

635
00:17:53,616 --> 0:17:54,926
will have a separate bundle ID

636
00:17:54,926 --> 0:17:56,916
and will exist on the App Store

637
00:17:56,916 --> 0:17:58,226
alongside LunchControl.

638
00:17:58,776 --> 0:18:00,826
This is not simply publishing

639
00:17:58,776 --> 0:18:00,826
This is not simply publishing

640
00:18:00,826 --> 0:18:02,356
the same app under a different

641
00:18:02,356 --> 0:18:02,996
customer name.

642
00:18:03,346 --> 0:18:04,316
It's a new and distinct

643
00:18:04,316 --> 0:18:04,986
experience.

644
00:18:06,196 --> 0:18:08,416
So, how would Liquid Oxygen work

645
00:18:08,416 --> 0:18:10,026
with Taco Bar as a third-party

646
00:18:10,026 --> 0:18:11,526
developer when building an App

647
00:18:11,696 --> 0:18:12,416
Store app for them?

648
00:18:12,736 --> 0:18:13,836
What's the best way for them to

649
00:18:13,836 --> 0:18:14,526
work together?

650
00:18:15,086 --> 0:18:18,226
Taco Bar is hiring Liquid Oxygen

651
00:18:18,356 --> 0:18:19,666
to build an app and submit it to

652
00:18:19,666 --> 0:18:21,286
the store under their developer

653
00:18:21,286 --> 0:18:21,616
account.

654
00:18:22,586 --> 0:18:24,186
The developer has to join Taco

655
00:18:24,186 --> 0:18:25,616
Bar's developer program and

656
00:18:25,616 --> 0:18:27,246
provide a build of the app for

657
00:18:27,246 --> 0:18:29,076
Taco Bar to submit to the store.

658
00:18:29,796 --> 0:18:30,866
This is what that workflow

659
00:18:30,866 --> 0:18:31,506
should look like.

660
00:18:32,896 --> 0:18:34,406
The two developer roles that

661
00:18:34,406 --> 0:18:35,956
Taco Bar should assign to Liquid

662
00:18:35,956 --> 0:18:38,866
Oxygen are Developer and

663
00:18:38,866 --> 0:18:39,426
Marketing.

664
00:18:40,146 --> 0:18:41,616
This would allow them to upload

665
00:18:41,616 --> 0:18:43,186
bills and provide marketing

666
00:18:43,186 --> 0:18:44,336
metadata like the app's

667
00:18:44,366 --> 0:18:45,886
description and screen shots.

668
00:18:47,146 --> 0:18:48,586
The admin role should remain

669
00:18:48,586 --> 0:18:49,736
internal to Taco Bar.

670
00:18:51,136 --> 0:18:53,156
This enables Taco Bar to control

671
00:18:53,156 --> 0:18:54,606
TestFlight distribution,

672
00:18:54,876 --> 0:18:57,556
pricing, submission, and go live

673
00:18:57,556 --> 0:18:58,266
on the App Store.

674
00:18:59,076 --> 0:19:00,916
The app manager role should also

675
00:18:59,076 --> 0:19:00,916
The app manager role should also

676
00:19:00,916 --> 0:19:01,646
remain internal.

677
00:19:02,176 --> 0:19:04,946
Here's what it looks like to add

678
00:19:05,126 --> 0:19:06,456
and manage users in App Store

679
00:19:06,456 --> 0:19:06,776
Connect.

680
00:19:07,826 --> 0:19:09,366
Users with the admin and app

681
00:19:09,546 --> 0:19:11,476
manager roles can create and

682
00:19:11,476 --> 0:19:13,546
edit users and also restrict a

683
00:19:13,546 --> 0:19:15,936
user's access to specific apps

684
00:19:15,936 --> 0:19:16,556
in the account.

685
00:19:17,806 --> 0:19:19,256
Make sure to limit third-party

686
00:19:19,256 --> 0:19:21,346
developer access to only those

687
00:19:21,346 --> 0:19:22,546
apps that they're working on.

688
00:19:23,536 --> 0:19:25,816
But note, user access cannot be

689
00:19:25,816 --> 0:19:27,586
restricted to specific apps on

690
00:19:27,586 --> 0:19:28,546
the developer site.

691
00:19:29,616 --> 0:19:31,606
Users will have access to all of

692
00:19:31,606 --> 0:19:33,396
the bundle IDs on the developer

693
00:19:33,396 --> 0:19:33,656
site.

694
00:19:34,676 --> 0:19:36,436
You can see here that Tracy is

695
00:19:36,436 --> 0:19:38,286
the developer, and she has

696
00:19:38,286 --> 0:19:40,456
access to the Taco Bar app only.

697
00:19:41,066 --> 0:19:43,376
And if LunchControl and Liquid

698
00:19:43,376 --> 0:19:45,996
Oxygen, LLC, were no longer to

699
00:19:45,996 --> 0:19:47,396
have a relationship with Taco

700
00:19:47,396 --> 0:19:48,766
Bar, the customer could always

701
00:19:48,766 --> 0:19:50,036
remove them as a third-party

702
00:19:50,036 --> 0:19:51,156
developer later on.

703
00:19:51,736 --> 0:19:55,076
If you're developing an app for

704
00:19:55,076 --> 0:19:57,606
a business, that business is the

705
00:19:57,606 --> 0:19:59,246
only one allowed to submit to

706
00:19:59,246 --> 0:19:59,816
the App Store.

707
00:20:00,616 --> 0:20:02,066
That means that apps must be

708
00:20:02,066 --> 0:20:03,586
submitted under client accounts,

709
00:20:04,306 --> 0:20:06,156
and customers of Taco Bar are

710
00:20:06,156 --> 0:20:07,526
going to expect to be

711
00:20:07,526 --> 0:20:09,166
downloading an app from Taco

712
00:20:09,166 --> 0:20:10,976
Bar, Ltd., not from Liquid

713
00:20:10,976 --> 0:20:12,246
Oxygen, LLC.

714
00:20:13,046 --> 0:20:14,126
For more information on this,

715
00:20:14,126 --> 0:20:15,356
you can review to App Store

716
00:20:15,356 --> 0:20:17,956
review guidelines section 5.2.

717
00:20:18,716 --> 0:20:20,796
Powerful roles like admin and

718
00:20:20,796 --> 0:20:22,206
app manager should be limited

719
00:20:22,206 --> 0:20:24,396
for third-party developers, and

720
00:20:24,396 --> 0:20:25,856
customers should also limit app

721
00:20:25,896 --> 0:20:28,266
access to only the apps that

722
00:20:28,266 --> 0:20:29,986
they'll be working on, and you

723
00:20:29,986 --> 0:20:31,176
should also follow the best

724
00:20:31,176 --> 0:20:32,456
practices for app versioning

725
00:20:32,456 --> 0:20:33,236
that we discussed.

726
00:20:33,786 --> 0:20:36,346
That concludes our discussion

727
00:20:36,576 --> 0:20:37,756
about the different scenarios

728
00:20:37,756 --> 0:20:38,616
where you would distribute a

729
00:20:38,676 --> 0:20:40,926
public-facing app through the

730
00:20:41,456 --> 0:20:42,446
App Store.

731
00:20:42,586 --> 0:20:43,506
For the remainder of the

732
00:20:43,506 --> 0:20:45,106
session, we're going to talk

733
00:20:45,106 --> 0:20:46,626
about two ways to distribute

734
00:20:46,626 --> 0:20:48,426
apps that are customized for a

735
00:20:48,426 --> 0:20:50,416
business, intended to be used

736
00:20:50,486 --> 0:20:52,636
privately and internally by that

737
00:20:52,636 --> 0:20:53,076
business.

738
00:20:53,746 --> 0:20:55,056
The first one we'll talk about

739
00:20:55,126 --> 0:20:56,576
is in-house distribution.

740
00:20:57,646 --> 0:20:58,926
Let's check back in on

741
00:20:58,926 --> 0:20:59,536
LunchControl.

742
00:20:59,906 --> 0:21:02,636
Exciting things are happening,

743
00:20:59,906 --> 0:21:02,636
Exciting things are happening,

744
00:21:02,706 --> 0:21:04,666
and Acme Company has approached

745
00:21:04,666 --> 0:21:06,656
you to build them a custom

746
00:21:06,656 --> 0:21:08,096
version of LunchControl for

747
00:21:08,096 --> 0:21:09,416
their corporate cafeteria and

748
00:21:09,416 --> 0:21:11,246
catering services so that their

749
00:21:11,246 --> 0:21:12,606
employees can order food and

750
00:21:12,606 --> 0:21:13,886
have the same great experience

751
00:21:13,886 --> 0:21:14,736
that you offer in your app.

752
00:21:15,646 --> 0:21:17,046
This would mean incorporating

753
00:21:17,046 --> 0:21:18,236
their back-end system into the

754
00:21:18,236 --> 0:21:20,216
app and building a totally

755
00:21:20,216 --> 0:21:21,376
customized version for them.

756
00:21:22,546 --> 0:21:24,776
In this case, Acme Company is

757
00:21:24,776 --> 0:21:25,816
going to be the customer

758
00:21:26,216 --> 0:21:27,846
purchasing a custom app for a

759
00:21:27,846 --> 0:21:29,576
group of users who happen to be

760
00:21:29,576 --> 0:21:30,366
their employees.

761
00:21:31,076 --> 0:21:32,856
We'll call it Acme Co. Café.

762
00:21:34,106 --> 0:21:35,346
Knowing that the audience for

763
00:21:35,346 --> 0:21:37,246
this app isn't public, it's the

764
00:21:37,246 --> 0:21:38,866
employees of a company, it's

765
00:21:38,866 --> 0:21:40,766
apparent that a public app store

766
00:21:40,766 --> 0:21:42,026
isn't appropriate for this use

767
00:21:42,026 --> 0:21:42,376
case.

768
00:21:43,326 --> 0:21:44,626
When we think about apps for

769
00:21:44,626 --> 0:21:46,096
internal use, there are two

770
00:21:46,096 --> 0:21:47,426
distribution methods that come

771
00:21:47,426 --> 0:21:50,076
to mind, in-house and custom

772
00:21:51,036 --> 0:21:51,126
apps.

773
00:21:51,656 --> 0:21:54,166
In a previous world, Acme

774
00:21:54,166 --> 0:21:55,726
Company would probably have an

775
00:21:55,726 --> 0:21:57,086
Apple Developer Enterprise

776
00:21:57,206 --> 0:21:58,686
Program account and would

777
00:21:58,686 --> 0:22:00,346
utilize in-house distribution to

778
00:21:58,686 --> 0:22:00,346
utilize in-house distribution to

779
00:22:00,346 --> 0:22:00,956
deploy this app.

780
00:22:02,206 --> 0:22:04,306
For a very long time, this was

781
00:22:04,306 --> 0:22:05,526
the only way to do it.

782
00:22:06,456 --> 0:22:08,326
But recently, we've enabled the

783
00:22:08,326 --> 0:22:09,986
ability for these types of apps

784
00:22:10,016 --> 0:22:11,926
to be hosted on the App Store's

785
00:22:11,926 --> 0:22:13,706
infrastructure via custom apps,

786
00:22:13,706 --> 0:22:15,586
and there are a host of benefits

787
00:22:15,586 --> 0:22:16,176
to doing so.

788
00:22:17,376 --> 0:22:18,476
While the Apple Developer

789
00:22:18,536 --> 0:22:20,796
Enterprise Program still exists,

790
00:22:21,296 --> 0:22:22,476
it's no longer the standard

791
00:22:22,476 --> 0:22:23,856
mechanism for distributing

792
00:22:23,856 --> 0:22:25,026
private internal apps.

793
00:22:25,896 --> 0:22:27,176
There are some exceptions where

794
00:22:27,176 --> 0:22:28,906
it still may be appropriate, but

795
00:22:28,906 --> 0:22:30,256
for the vast majority of those

796
00:22:30,256 --> 0:22:31,826
building private internal apps,

797
00:22:32,276 --> 0:22:33,776
custom apps is going to be the

798
00:22:33,776 --> 0:22:34,416
way forward.

799
00:22:35,016 --> 0:22:38,516
In-house distribution, we'll

800
00:22:38,516 --> 0:22:40,156
just cover it so that you know

801
00:22:40,156 --> 0:22:41,346
how it works if you do run into

802
00:22:41,346 --> 0:22:41,516
it.

803
00:22:41,876 --> 0:22:43,166
So, in-house distribution

804
00:22:43,166 --> 0:22:44,836
enables you to control the

805
00:22:44,836 --> 0:22:47,056
entire distribution process and

806
00:22:47,056 --> 0:22:48,026
host the app yourself.

807
00:22:48,646 --> 0:22:50,226
It requires membership into the

808
00:22:50,226 --> 0:22:51,376
Apple Developer Enterprise

809
00:22:51,456 --> 0:22:53,236
Program, but there are strict

810
00:22:53,236 --> 0:22:54,696
eligibility requirements to get

811
00:22:54,696 --> 0:22:56,826
into that program, and it really

812
00:22:56,826 --> 0:22:58,276
is meant for those cases that

813
00:22:58,276 --> 0:22:59,616
really can't be solved by custom

814
00:22:59,616 --> 0:23:00,576
app distribution.

815
00:22:59,616 --> 0:23:00,576
app distribution.

816
00:23:01,306 --> 0:23:02,696
Regions where Apple business

817
00:23:02,696 --> 0:23:04,836
manager doesn't work, use cases

818
00:23:04,836 --> 0:23:05,616
for state and federal

819
00:23:05,616 --> 0:23:07,406
government, or use cases where

820
00:23:07,406 --> 0:23:08,736
there are other intellectual

821
00:23:08,806 --> 0:23:10,586
property issues could still

822
00:23:10,586 --> 0:23:11,486
qualify for in-house

823
00:23:11,486 --> 0:23:12,226
distribution.

824
00:23:13,216 --> 0:23:15,386
Organizations utilizing in-house

825
00:23:15,426 --> 0:23:17,336
distribution should own and

826
00:23:17,336 --> 0:23:18,746
maintain the source code so that

827
00:23:18,746 --> 0:23:20,016
they can do their own build to

828
00:23:20,016 --> 0:23:20,976
maintain the project.

829
00:23:21,656 --> 0:23:22,846
Distribution is handled

830
00:23:22,846 --> 0:23:24,316
completely outside of the App

831
00:23:24,316 --> 0:23:27,376
Store by the organization and is

832
00:23:27,376 --> 0:23:28,916
usually done by MDM.

833
00:23:29,816 --> 0:23:32,936
If you do find yourself in a

834
00:23:32,936 --> 0:23:34,116
situation where you're leverage

835
00:23:34,116 --> 0:23:35,766
in-house distribution, there are

836
00:23:35,766 --> 0:23:36,806
a few things that you should be

837
00:23:36,806 --> 0:23:37,306
aware of.

838
00:23:38,206 --> 0:23:40,166
First and foremost, the apps

839
00:23:40,386 --> 0:23:42,246
that you deploy using in-house

840
00:23:42,276 --> 0:23:44,706
distribution must only go to

841
00:23:44,706 --> 0:23:46,576
your employees and cannot be

842
00:23:46,576 --> 0:23:47,736
made available to others.

843
00:23:48,916 --> 0:23:50,226
Apps are signed by the

844
00:23:50,226 --> 0:23:52,036
organization with a distribution

845
00:23:52,036 --> 0:23:53,416
certificate, and that

846
00:23:53,596 --> 0:23:54,706
certificate needs to be

847
00:23:54,706 --> 0:23:55,086
protected.

848
00:23:55,146 --> 0:23:57,906
If it were to be compromised or

849
00:23:57,906 --> 0:23:59,806
revoked for any reason, all of

850
00:23:59,806 --> 0:24:01,156
the apps that you deployed with

851
00:23:59,806 --> 0:24:01,156
the apps that you deployed with

852
00:24:01,156 --> 0:24:02,436
that certificate would stop

853
00:24:02,436 --> 0:24:04,546
working immediately, and they

854
00:24:04,546 --> 0:24:06,306
would need to be re-signed and

855
00:24:06,306 --> 0:24:07,016
redeployed.

856
00:24:07,746 --> 0:24:09,586
As you might imagine, that could

857
00:24:09,586 --> 0:24:13,066
be catastrophic for a business.

858
00:24:13,186 --> 0:24:14,666
Additionally, certificates will

859
00:24:14,666 --> 0:24:16,036
expire every three years, and

860
00:24:16,476 --> 0:24:19,006
the provisioning profiles expire

861
00:24:19,006 --> 0:24:19,506
annually.

862
00:24:19,606 --> 0:24:20,756
So you need to manage that

863
00:24:20,756 --> 0:24:22,506
certificate lifecycle and plan

864
00:24:22,506 --> 0:24:23,826
for frequent releases of your

865
00:24:23,826 --> 0:24:25,396
app that are aligned with it.

866
00:24:26,606 --> 0:24:28,236
Beta testing and hosting of the

867
00:24:28,236 --> 0:24:29,656
apps needs to be handled by the

868
00:24:29,656 --> 0:24:31,596
organization and MDM, and

869
00:24:32,086 --> 0:24:33,576
there's no TestFlight access for

870
00:24:33,576 --> 0:24:34,306
enterprise accounts.

871
00:24:35,506 --> 0:24:36,956
Apps are also going to need

872
00:24:36,986 --> 0:24:38,376
periodic access to the internet,

873
00:24:38,976 --> 0:24:40,846
which makes it very difficult to

874
00:24:40,846 --> 0:24:42,706
deploy apps in air gap networks.

875
00:24:43,226 --> 0:24:46,696
Based on what we just talked

876
00:24:46,696 --> 0:24:48,506
about, in-house distribution

877
00:24:48,506 --> 0:24:49,966
isn't going to be a good fit for

878
00:24:50,126 --> 0:24:50,316
Acme.

879
00:24:51,506 --> 0:24:53,466
Let's move onto Custom Apps.

880
00:24:53,606 --> 0:24:54,826
This is the new way forward.

881
00:24:55,346 --> 0:24:58,006
This scenario could work one of

882
00:24:58,076 --> 0:24:58,496
two ways.

883
00:24:59,806 --> 0:25:01,316
The developer could simply offer

884
00:24:59,806 --> 0:25:01,316
The developer could simply offer

885
00:25:01,316 --> 0:25:02,536
the app for sale to them via

886
00:25:02,756 --> 0:25:04,616
Custom Apps under their own

887
00:25:04,616 --> 0:25:06,086
account, which would protect

888
00:25:06,086 --> 0:25:07,326
their intellectual property.

889
00:25:07,886 --> 0:25:09,176
This could be described as

890
00:25:09,226 --> 0:25:10,286
business to business, and this

891
00:25:10,286 --> 0:25:11,336
is actually the way that Custom

892
00:25:11,386 --> 0:25:12,136
Apps used to work.

893
00:25:12,946 --> 0:25:14,546
Alternatively, the developer

894
00:25:14,546 --> 0:25:15,726
could negotiate with Acme

895
00:25:15,726 --> 0:25:16,876
Company and provide them source

896
00:25:16,926 --> 0:25:18,436
code, and they would handle the

897
00:25:18,436 --> 0:25:19,516
submission of the Custom App

898
00:25:19,646 --> 0:25:21,606
themselves under their own Acme

899
00:25:21,606 --> 0:25:23,386
account, which we could describe

900
00:25:23,386 --> 0:25:24,406
as business to self.

901
00:25:25,336 --> 0:25:26,996
Either way, Custom Apps is the

902
00:25:26,996 --> 0:25:27,756
right solution.

903
00:25:28,336 --> 0:25:31,386
How does Custom App distribution

904
00:25:31,386 --> 0:25:31,646
work?

905
00:25:32,836 --> 0:25:34,326
Custom Apps are part of the

906
00:25:34,326 --> 0:25:36,046
Apple Developer Program and are

907
00:25:36,126 --> 0:25:38,196
hosted by Apple in Apple

908
00:25:38,196 --> 0:25:39,026
Business Manager.

909
00:25:40,146 --> 0:25:41,896
Custom Apps used to be available

910
00:25:41,896 --> 0:25:43,276
only to developers selling an

911
00:25:43,276 --> 0:25:45,266
app to another organization, but

912
00:25:45,266 --> 0:25:46,606
you can now use it to distribute

913
00:25:46,606 --> 0:25:48,146
internally to your own employees

914
00:25:48,586 --> 0:25:49,876
just like you would leverage

915
00:25:49,876 --> 0:25:51,126
in-house distribution.

916
00:25:51,956 --> 0:25:53,286
This make it much easier to

917
00:25:53,286 --> 0:25:54,076
distribute apps to your

918
00:25:54,076 --> 0:25:56,976
employees, and Custom Apps works

919
00:25:57,056 --> 0:25:58,586
for distributing to employees,

920
00:25:58,856 --> 0:26:01,456
partners, clients, franchisees,

921
00:25:58,856 --> 0:26:01,456
partners, clients, franchisees,

922
00:26:01,456 --> 0:26:02,246
or affiliates.

923
00:26:03,316 --> 0:26:05,016
Customers can also distribute

924
00:26:05,016 --> 0:26:07,186
licenses via MDM or leverage

925
00:26:07,186 --> 0:26:08,696
redemption codes.

926
00:26:09,566 --> 0:26:11,066
For those of you who are used to

927
00:26:11,066 --> 0:26:12,306
the Apple Developer Enterprise

928
00:26:12,346 --> 0:26:14,126
Program, Custom Apps offers a

929
00:26:14,126 --> 0:26:14,786
lot of benefits.

930
00:26:15,546 --> 0:26:17,136
You'll only need one program to

931
00:26:17,136 --> 0:26:18,556
manage both your App Store and

932
00:26:18,556 --> 0:26:20,086
your internal apps.

933
00:26:20,086 --> 0:26:22,046
The apps won't expire, so you

934
00:26:22,046 --> 0:26:22,866
don't need to worry about

935
00:26:22,866 --> 0:26:24,726
distribution certs being revoked

936
00:26:24,726 --> 0:26:25,386
or expiring.

937
00:26:26,776 --> 0:26:28,596
While with in-house distribution

938
00:26:28,596 --> 0:26:29,666
you could only distribute to

939
00:26:29,666 --> 0:26:31,636
employees, Custom Apps actually

940
00:26:31,636 --> 0:26:32,706
allows you to reach a broader

941
00:26:32,706 --> 0:26:34,046
audience, including business

942
00:26:34,046 --> 0:26:34,676
affiliates.

943
00:26:36,086 --> 0:26:37,456
It's also easier to work with

944
00:26:37,456 --> 0:26:38,736
third-party developers because

945
00:26:38,736 --> 0:26:40,516
you can get and distribute an

946
00:26:40,516 --> 0:26:42,276
app from them without having

947
00:26:42,276 --> 0:26:43,576
access to the source code, and

948
00:26:43,786 --> 0:26:44,936
there's no re-signing of

949
00:26:44,986 --> 0:26:45,896
binaries involved.

950
00:26:47,066 --> 0:26:48,366
You can also take advantage of

951
00:26:48,366 --> 0:26:50,036
the App Store's auto update

952
00:26:50,036 --> 0:26:51,726
infrastructure, features like

953
00:26:51,776 --> 0:26:53,806
caching and app thinning as well

954
00:26:53,806 --> 0:26:55,586
as the TestFlight and App Store

955
00:26:56,136 --> 0:26:57,876
Connect tools.

956
00:26:58,046 --> 0:26:59,316
Here's how you would actually go

957
00:26:59,316 --> 0:27:00,536
about submitting a Custom App.

958
00:26:59,316 --> 0:27:00,536
about submitting a Custom App.

959
00:27:01,656 --> 0:27:03,246
First, you would confirm that

960
00:27:03,246 --> 0:27:04,636
your account is properly set up

961
00:27:04,666 --> 0:27:05,776
to support Custom Apps.

962
00:27:06,436 --> 0:27:07,846
Both app agreements need to be

963
00:27:07,846 --> 0:27:09,566
active, and you need to provide

964
00:27:09,596 --> 0:27:11,196
banking and tax information.

965
00:27:12,266 --> 0:27:13,686
You can leverage roles to define

966
00:27:13,686 --> 0:27:15,226
proper access for the project

967
00:27:15,286 --> 0:27:17,036
team once you have the app set

968
00:27:17,836 --> 0:27:17,906
up.

969
00:27:19,076 --> 0:27:20,786
A developer would create a new

970
00:27:20,786 --> 0:27:22,316
app identifier in the member

971
00:27:22,316 --> 0:27:23,716
center of the developer website

972
00:27:23,716 --> 0:27:25,926
and also a new app record in App

973
00:27:26,056 --> 0:27:26,506
Store Connect.

974
00:27:27,786 --> 0:27:29,416
Anytime that you want to list a

975
00:27:29,416 --> 0:27:31,216
custom app for sale, you need to

976
00:27:31,216 --> 0:27:33,376
create a new app ID and a new

977
00:27:33,376 --> 0:27:34,016
app record.

978
00:27:34,606 --> 0:27:36,246
The same bundle identifier

979
00:27:36,246 --> 0:27:38,176
cannot be available in both the

980
00:27:38,236 --> 0:27:40,596
public App Store and privately

981
00:27:40,596 --> 0:27:41,296
as a custom app.

982
00:27:41,906 --> 0:27:43,226
They're totally separate apps

983
00:27:43,546 --> 0:27:45,436
with separate bundle InDesign.

984
00:27:46,736 --> 0:27:48,386
Next, you would upload a build

985
00:27:48,696 --> 0:27:49,896
and attach it to the working

986
00:27:49,896 --> 0:27:53,946
version in App Store Connect.

987
00:27:54,116 --> 0:27:55,156
Beta testing would be done with

988
00:27:55,206 --> 0:27:55,676
TestFlight.

989
00:27:56,766 --> 0:27:58,286
When Beta Testing is complete,

990
00:27:58,766 --> 0:28:00,506
all of the app metadata and

991
00:27:58,766 --> 0:28:00,506
all of the app metadata and

992
00:28:00,506 --> 0:28:01,836
finalized marketing material

993
00:28:01,836 --> 0:28:03,656
should be verified and added.

994
00:28:03,656 --> 0:28:08,286
You would then list the app for

995
00:28:08,286 --> 0:28:10,156
sale as a custom app in the

996
00:28:10,156 --> 0:28:11,616
pricing and availability

997
00:28:11,616 --> 0:28:12,086
section.

998
00:28:13,396 --> 0:28:15,096
Note, once an app is submitted

999
00:28:15,096 --> 0:28:17,036
for review as either a custom

1000
00:28:17,226 --> 0:28:19,026
app or a public app, you can't

1001
00:28:19,026 --> 0:28:20,596
go back and change the audience

1002
00:28:20,766 --> 0:28:22,666
from public to private for vice

1003
00:28:22,666 --> 0:28:23,596
versa later on.

1004
00:28:24,276 --> 0:28:25,896
To list the app for sale as a

1005
00:28:25,896 --> 0:28:27,076
custom app for business, you

1006
00:28:27,656 --> 0:28:29,556
need to provide the customer's

1007
00:28:29,556 --> 0:28:31,786
DEP ID and organization name.

1008
00:28:32,356 --> 0:28:35,636
The DEP ID is a unique

1009
00:28:35,636 --> 0:28:36,996
identifier given to the

1010
00:28:36,996 --> 0:28:38,706
organization when they enroll in

1011
00:28:38,706 --> 0:28:39,836
Apple Business Manager.

1012
00:28:42,076 --> 0:28:44,206
Finally, you would submit the

1013
00:28:44,206 --> 0:28:45,016
app for review.

1014
00:28:46,426 --> 0:28:47,536
Once it's approved and

1015
00:28:47,536 --> 0:28:49,636
available, you customer can

1016
00:28:49,636 --> 0:28:53,646
purchase and distribute the app.

1017
00:28:53,886 --> 0:28:55,416
Purchasing is done through Apple

1018
00:28:55,416 --> 0:28:56,246
Business Manager.

1019
00:28:56,846 --> 0:28:58,336
The customer would enroll at

1020
00:28:58,336 --> 0:29:00,436
business.apple.com, and with

1021
00:28:58,336 --> 0:29:00,436
business.apple.com, and with

1022
00:29:00,436 --> 0:29:02,156
this program, they can buy App

1023
00:29:02,156 --> 0:29:03,836
Store apps, custom apps and

1024
00:29:03,836 --> 0:29:05,626
books in bulk, and deploy to

1025
00:29:05,626 --> 0:29:06,746
their devices and users.

1026
00:29:07,486 --> 0:29:08,836
They can also do app license

1027
00:29:08,836 --> 0:29:09,406
management.

1028
00:29:10,196 --> 0:29:11,566
Note that this needs to be set

1029
00:29:11,566 --> 0:29:13,006
up in advance of you listing the

1030
00:29:13,006 --> 0:29:14,246
app for sale as a custom app

1031
00:29:14,776 --> 0:29:16,236
because you need that DEP ID and

1032
00:29:16,236 --> 0:29:18,556
organization name to distribute

1033
00:29:18,756 --> 0:29:20,226
the app to them.

1034
00:29:20,386 --> 0:29:21,536
And Custom Apps will also be

1035
00:29:21,536 --> 0:29:22,836
available for Apple School

1036
00:29:22,836 --> 0:29:23,936
Manager this fall.

1037
00:29:24,746 --> 0:29:27,646
This is what Apple Business

1038
00:29:27,646 --> 0:29:28,516
Manager looks like.

1039
00:29:29,156 --> 0:29:30,766
Your customer will see the app

1040
00:29:30,766 --> 0:29:32,046
that you are listing for sale

1041
00:29:32,046 --> 0:29:35,056
for them under the Custom Apps

1042
00:29:35,816 --> 0:29:36,026
section.

1043
00:29:36,156 --> 0:29:37,556
Let's review what this process

1044
00:29:37,556 --> 0:29:39,326
looks like end-to-end for both

1045
00:29:39,326 --> 0:29:40,626
the customer and the developer.

1046
00:29:41,556 --> 0:29:43,276
The customer first provides you

1047
00:29:43,596 --> 0:29:45,096
with their organization name and

1048
00:29:45,096 --> 0:29:46,306
DEP ID from Apple Business

1049
00:29:46,306 --> 0:29:46,806
Manager.

1050
00:29:47,636 --> 0:29:49,806
Once you have that, when you set

1051
00:29:49,806 --> 0:29:51,026
up the App in App Store Connect,

1052
00:29:51,616 --> 0:29:52,966
in the pricing and availability

1053
00:29:52,966 --> 0:29:54,756
section, you select to make it

1054
00:29:54,756 --> 0:29:56,876
available privately as a Custom

1055
00:29:56,876 --> 0:29:59,196
App for business and specify

1056
00:29:59,196 --> 0:30:00,846
that DEP ID and organization

1057
00:29:59,196 --> 0:30:00,846
that DEP ID and organization

1058
00:30:00,846 --> 0:30:00,976
name.

1059
00:30:02,586 --> 0:30:03,846
Once the app is submitted and

1060
00:30:03,846 --> 0:30:05,586
approved, the customer can then

1061
00:30:05,586 --> 0:30:07,276
go and purchase licenses of it

1062
00:30:07,536 --> 0:30:08,706
from Apple Business Manager.

1063
00:30:09,306 --> 0:30:12,586
If for some reason you aren't

1064
00:30:12,586 --> 0:30:14,796
able to submit a custom app or

1065
00:30:14,846 --> 0:30:16,486
your customer isn't able to see

1066
00:30:16,486 --> 0:30:17,936
an app that you've assigned to

1067
00:30:17,936 --> 0:30:19,726
them, here are a few places that

1068
00:30:19,726 --> 0:30:20,726
you can troubleshoot.

1069
00:30:21,576 --> 0:30:23,136
First, on the developer side,

1070
00:30:23,526 --> 0:30:25,246
make sure both the free and paid

1071
00:30:25,246 --> 0:30:27,376
agreements are complete as well

1072
00:30:27,376 --> 0:30:28,236
as all of your banking

1073
00:30:28,236 --> 0:30:28,966
information.

1074
00:30:29,856 --> 0:30:31,406
If the customer isn't able to

1075
00:30:31,406 --> 0:30:33,056
see the app, make sure that

1076
00:30:33,056 --> 0:30:34,236
Custom Apps are enabled for

1077
00:30:34,236 --> 0:30:36,146
their account under settings and

1078
00:30:36,146 --> 0:30:37,656
enrollment info in Apple

1079
00:30:37,656 --> 0:30:38,556
Business Manager.

1080
00:30:39,486 --> 0:30:40,986
It also may take a few minutes

1081
00:30:40,986 --> 0:30:43,016
for the app to become visible in

1082
00:30:43,056 --> 0:30:44,696
Apple Business Manager, so just

1083
00:30:44,696 --> 0:30:45,746
give it a little bit of time,

1084
00:30:46,376 --> 0:30:48,286
and you can also consult the App

1085
00:30:48,336 --> 0:30:49,686
Store Connect help page for more

1086
00:30:49,686 --> 0:30:50,336
information.

1087
00:30:53,296 --> 0:30:54,806
Here are a few things to keep in

1088
00:30:54,806 --> 0:30:56,926
mind about Custom Apps.

1089
00:30:56,926 --> 0:30:58,356
Customers need to have an Apple

1090
00:30:58,356 --> 0:30:59,466
Business Manager account to

1091
00:30:59,466 --> 0:31:00,006
purchase your app.

1092
00:30:59,466 --> 0:31:00,006
purchase your app.

1093
00:31:01,296 --> 0:31:02,806
Apps have to support the

1094
00:31:02,906 --> 0:31:03,906
countries that they will be

1095
00:31:03,906 --> 0:31:04,756
distributed in.

1096
00:31:05,546 --> 0:31:07,996
By default, an app is set up to

1097
00:31:07,996 --> 0:31:09,616
support all territories in App

1098
00:31:09,616 --> 0:31:11,556
Store Connect, and you shouldn't

1099
00:31:11,556 --> 0:31:12,616
change this unless you really

1100
00:31:12,616 --> 0:31:13,086
need to.

1101
00:31:13,966 --> 0:31:15,326
It's expected that if you're

1102
00:31:15,326 --> 0:31:16,796
utilizing redemption codes for

1103
00:31:16,796 --> 0:31:18,776
distribution that they won't be

1104
00:31:18,776 --> 0:31:20,216
made publicly available, and

1105
00:31:20,216 --> 0:31:21,706
you'll instead make sure they

1106
00:31:21,706 --> 0:31:23,076
make it into the hands of your

1107
00:31:23,076 --> 0:31:24,056
specific users.

1108
00:31:24,686 --> 0:31:27,466
This is a new app that needs to

1109
00:31:27,466 --> 0:31:29,626
go through app review, and the

1110
00:31:29,626 --> 0:31:30,716
review team is going to need to

1111
00:31:30,716 --> 0:31:31,766
be able to access the full

1112
00:31:31,766 --> 0:31:33,886
functionality of the app.

1113
00:31:33,886 --> 0:31:36,206
And once submitted, apps can't

1114
00:31:36,206 --> 0:31:37,876
be moved between public and

1115
00:31:37,876 --> 0:31:38,976
private availability.

1116
00:31:42,096 --> 0:31:43,746
That concludes Custom Apps.

1117
00:31:44,736 --> 0:31:45,916
We've covered the four

1118
00:31:46,136 --> 0:31:47,366
distribution methods that you

1119
00:31:47,366 --> 0:31:48,856
have to choose from, and the

1120
00:31:48,856 --> 0:31:51,156
easiest way to decide which is

1121
00:31:51,156 --> 0:31:52,626
right for you is to think about

1122
00:31:52,626 --> 0:31:54,816
the audience for your app is

1123
00:31:54,886 --> 0:31:56,186
public or private.

1124
00:31:56,186 --> 0:31:58,706
Ad Hoc lets you distribute to a

1125
00:31:58,706 --> 0:32:00,966
limited private audience for

1126
00:31:58,706 --> 0:32:00,966
limited private audience for

1127
00:32:00,966 --> 0:32:01,486
testing.

1128
00:32:02,096 --> 0:32:03,066
The App Store lets you

1129
00:32:03,066 --> 0:32:04,226
distribute apps to the general

1130
00:32:04,286 --> 0:32:06,796
public, and In-House and Custom

1131
00:32:06,796 --> 0:32:08,346
App distribution let you

1132
00:32:08,346 --> 0:32:09,766
distribute apps privately.

1133
00:32:10,446 --> 0:32:14,006
Let's review the distribution

1134
00:32:14,006 --> 0:32:15,166
scenarios that we talked about

1135
00:32:15,256 --> 0:32:15,576
today.

1136
00:32:16,186 --> 0:32:19,196
What if the app is for the

1137
00:32:19,196 --> 0:32:19,836
general public?

1138
00:32:20,906 --> 0:32:21,946
If the app is for the general

1139
00:32:22,016 --> 0:32:24,846
public, it belongs on the App

1140
00:32:26,636 --> 0:32:26,756
Store.

1141
00:32:26,966 --> 0:32:27,986
What if you don't want to give

1142
00:32:27,986 --> 0:32:29,296
up your intellectual property to

1143
00:32:29,296 --> 0:32:29,926
an enterprise.

1144
00:32:29,926 --> 0:32:31,646
If you don't want to give up

1145
00:32:31,716 --> 0:32:33,246
intellectual property, you can

1146
00:32:33,246 --> 0:32:34,676
leverage Custom Apps to deliver

1147
00:32:34,676 --> 0:32:37,266
them a private, completed app.

1148
00:32:37,266 --> 0:32:39,036
And if you're writing an app for

1149
00:32:39,036 --> 0:32:40,326
the company where the audience

1150
00:32:40,326 --> 0:32:41,826
is the general public, you can

1151
00:32:41,826 --> 0:32:43,266
also deliver them a binary to

1152
00:32:43,376 --> 0:32:45,036
upload to their App Store

1153
00:32:45,036 --> 0:32:46,426
Connect account.

1154
00:32:47,756 --> 0:32:49,536
What if your customer doesn't

1155
00:32:49,656 --> 0:32:50,806
have an MDM solution?

1156
00:32:52,026 --> 0:32:53,426
The Custom Apps program along

1157
00:32:53,426 --> 0:32:55,346
with MDM can be used to deliver

1158
00:32:55,346 --> 0:32:57,506
apps to customers who don't have

1159
00:32:57,586 --> 0:32:58,066
MDM.

1160
00:33:01,996 --> 0:33:03,356
What if you're being paid as a

1161
00:33:03,356 --> 0:33:04,806
consultant to build an app for a

1162
00:33:04,806 --> 0:33:05,236
company?

1163
00:33:05,876 --> 0:33:07,586
So you can work in both the App

1164
00:33:07,796 --> 0:33:08,826
Store and the Custom Apps

1165
00:33:08,826 --> 0:33:11,476
program to, as a third-party

1166
00:33:11,476 --> 0:33:12,656
developer, to deliver an app to

1167
00:33:12,656 --> 0:33:13,216
someone else.

1168
00:33:14,156 --> 0:33:15,486
What if Apple Business Manager

1169
00:33:15,486 --> 0:33:17,106
isn't available for my customer?

1170
00:33:17,706 --> 0:33:18,886
So, if Apple Business Manager

1171
00:33:18,886 --> 0:33:20,506
isn't available, your customer

1172
00:33:20,506 --> 0:33:21,786
should be able to leverage

1173
00:33:22,026 --> 0:33:23,516
in-house distribution providing

1174
00:33:23,516 --> 0:33:24,946
that they're building an app for

1175
00:33:24,946 --> 0:33:25,676
their employees.

1176
00:33:26,296 --> 0:33:28,396
And what if the app is employee

1177
00:33:28,396 --> 0:33:28,876
facing?

1178
00:33:30,266 --> 0:33:31,756
Employee facing or private apps

1179
00:33:31,816 --> 0:33:33,176
can be distributed with both

1180
00:33:33,176 --> 0:33:35,706
Custom Apps or In-House, and

1181
00:33:36,396 --> 0:33:38,156
what if you want to distribute

1182
00:33:38,156 --> 0:33:39,726
an app to your own organization?

1183
00:33:41,296 --> 0:33:42,346
You can distribute to your own

1184
00:33:42,346 --> 0:33:43,686
organization using Custom Apps

1185
00:33:44,316 --> 0:33:45,626
or the In-House program.

1186
00:33:46,376 --> 0:33:48,046
To conclude this presentation, I

1187
00:33:48,046 --> 0:33:49,366
want to leave you with a quote

1188
00:33:49,366 --> 0:33:49,936
from a colleague.

1189
00:33:51,376 --> 0:33:52,846
"Apps are like cannonballs.

1190
00:33:53,586 --> 0:33:54,486
It's better to know where

1191
00:33:54,486 --> 0:33:55,806
they're going before they

1192
00:33:55,806 --> 0:33:56,206
deploy."

1193
00:33:57,736 --> 0:33:59,436
Apple wants you to be successful

1194
00:33:59,436 --> 0:34:00,536
and scale your app in the

1195
00:33:59,436 --> 0:34:00,536
and scale your app in the

1196
00:34:00,536 --> 0:34:02,296
smartest possible way, which

1197
00:34:02,296 --> 0:34:04,336
means thinking carefully about

1198
00:34:04,336 --> 0:34:05,636
the user and the customer,

1199
00:34:06,146 --> 0:34:07,216
managing your versions

1200
00:34:07,216 --> 0:34:09,206
appropriately, and knowing and

1201
00:34:09,206 --> 0:34:11,396
understanding the guidelines or

1202
00:34:11,396 --> 0:34:12,525
our developer programs.

1203
00:34:13,356 --> 0:34:14,676
If you understand how this works

1204
00:34:14,676 --> 0:34:16,505
up front, you can pick the right

1205
00:34:16,505 --> 0:34:18,036
distribution mechanism for your

1206
00:34:18,036 --> 0:34:19,916
app and deploy it to your users

1207
00:34:20,255 --> 0:34:21,315
without any friction.
