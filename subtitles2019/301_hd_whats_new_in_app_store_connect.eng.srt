00:00:15,046 --> 0:00:16,596
&gt;&gt; Hello and welcome to our

4
00:00:16,686 --> 0:00:18,526
session on What's New in App

5
00:00:18,526 --> 0:00:19,146
Store Connect.

6
00:00:19,816 --> 0:00:21,556
My name is Tommy McGlynn and I'm

7
00:00:21,556 --> 0:00:22,826
an App Store Connect Engineer.

8
00:00:24,116 --> 0:00:26,356
Today our focus is the App

9
00:00:26,356 --> 0:00:26,946
Lifecycle.

10
00:00:27,956 --> 0:00:28,906
This is everything from the

11
00:00:28,906 --> 0:00:30,536
moment you first began creating

12
00:00:30,536 --> 0:00:32,555
an app to the moment you make it

13
00:00:32,555 --> 0:00:36,006
available in the App Store.

14
00:00:36,206 --> 0:00:37,316
As we look at the lifecycle

15
00:00:37,316 --> 0:00:38,496
today, we'll highlight some

16
00:00:38,496 --> 0:00:39,696
things that are important to

17
00:00:39,696 --> 0:00:42,016
know and we'll look at recent

18
00:00:42,016 --> 0:00:43,746
improvements to specific phases

19
00:00:43,746 --> 0:00:44,466
of the lifecycle.

20
00:00:45,946 --> 0:00:47,166
And finally we'll look at some

21
00:00:47,166 --> 0:00:48,356
brand new features that you

22
00:00:48,356 --> 0:00:50,486
haven't seen yet.

23
00:00:50,756 --> 0:00:52,086
So let's begin where it all

24
00:00:52,086 --> 0:00:54,436
starts for every developer and

25
00:00:54,436 --> 0:00:55,576
that's where we design and

26
00:00:55,576 --> 0:00:57,416
develop apps in Xcode.

27
00:00:57,866 --> 0:01:00,546
Xcode is where you create apps,

28
00:00:57,866 --> 0:01:00,546
Xcode is where you create apps,

29
00:01:00,746 --> 0:01:01,926
and we've just announced that

30
00:01:01,926 --> 0:01:03,496
you can now deliver amazing

31
00:01:03,496 --> 0:01:05,075
watch apps without needing to

32
00:01:05,075 --> 0:01:07,366
build an iOS companion app.

33
00:01:08,946 --> 0:01:10,796
And these apps will be fully

34
00:01:10,796 --> 0:01:12,366
supported in App Store Connect

35
00:01:12,646 --> 0:01:14,306
from TestFlight through to

36
00:01:14,456 --> 0:01:16,246
through to the App Store and

37
00:01:16,816 --> 0:01:19,896
customers can discover your app

38
00:01:19,896 --> 0:01:21,526
right on their watch, in the new

39
00:01:21,526 --> 0:01:23,266
App Store built specifically for

40
00:01:23,266 --> 0:01:23,976
Apple Watch.

41
00:01:27,396 --> 0:01:29,156
Now you've built an app in Xcode

42
00:01:29,226 --> 0:01:30,256
and you're ready to share it

43
00:01:30,256 --> 0:01:30,866
with the world.

44
00:01:31,416 --> 0:01:34,246
The next step is to upload your

45
00:01:34,906 --> 0:01:34,973
app.

46
00:01:37,286 --> 0:01:38,666
A common way to deliver apps

47
00:01:38,666 --> 0:01:41,756
today is within Xcode or with

48
00:01:41,756 --> 0:01:43,506
Application Loader which is an

49
00:01:43,506 --> 0:01:46,906
app that's installed with Xcode.

50
00:01:47,056 --> 0:01:48,596
Beginning with the beta of Xcode

51
00:01:48,596 --> 0:01:50,926
11, Application Loader will no

52
00:01:50,926 --> 0:01:51,826
longer be included.

53
00:01:52,846 --> 0:01:54,616
Instead, we've created a new

54
00:01:54,616 --> 0:01:56,106
dedicated experience for

55
00:01:56,106 --> 0:01:57,956
delivering apps that does not

56
00:01:57,956 --> 0:01:59,546
require you to install Xcode.

57
00:02:00,786 --> 0:02:02,146
It's called Transporter.

58
00:02:02,666 --> 0:02:05,166
This is a dedicated Mac App

59
00:02:05,316 --> 0:02:06,976
that's super easy to use and

60
00:02:06,976 --> 0:02:08,166
it's a great way to deliver your

61
00:02:08,166 --> 0:02:08,586
apps.

62
00:02:10,056 --> 0:02:12,346
Transporter is also a localized

63
00:02:12,346 --> 0:02:12,576
app.

64
00:02:13,076 --> 0:02:14,436
So it's a great experience for

65
00:02:14,436 --> 0:02:16,306
anyone on your team across many

66
00:02:16,306 --> 0:02:16,906
languages.

67
00:02:18,296 --> 0:02:20,166
So let's take a closer look at

68
00:02:20,166 --> 0:02:21,156
how to use Transporter.

69
00:02:22,996 --> 0:02:24,476
First you sign in with your

70
00:02:24,476 --> 0:02:25,106
Apple ID.

71
00:02:26,446 --> 0:02:28,016
Then if you belong to multiple

72
00:02:28,016 --> 0:02:29,636
teams, you'll choose one from

73
00:02:29,636 --> 0:02:30,436
the drop-down list.

74
00:02:33,186 --> 0:02:34,246
Now it's time to select the

75
00:02:34,246 --> 0:02:35,536
files that you want to deliver.

76
00:02:36,726 --> 0:02:38,166
Transporter uses a simple

77
00:02:38,166 --> 0:02:39,366
drag-and-drop interface.

78
00:02:39,906 --> 0:02:42,306
You just take your IPA that

79
00:02:42,306 --> 0:02:44,186
you've exported from Xcode, drag

80
00:02:44,186 --> 0:02:45,806
it over Transporter and drop.

81
00:02:46,246 --> 0:02:48,656
From there it's a simple click

82
00:02:49,016 --> 0:02:52,846
to begin verifying the package.

83
00:02:52,996 --> 0:02:54,116
Transporter will display

84
00:02:54,116 --> 0:02:55,856
warnings and errors that occur

85
00:02:55,856 --> 0:02:57,786
during validation so you can

86
00:02:57,786 --> 0:03:01,556
find and fix them early.

87
00:02:57,786 --> 0:03:01,556
find and fix them early.

88
00:03:01,556 --> 0:03:02,766
Once errors have been addressed

89
00:03:03,106 --> 0:03:04,256
you can click to deliver the

90
00:03:04,256 --> 0:03:04,686
package.

91
00:03:06,496 --> 0:03:07,976
Transporter will display

92
00:03:07,976 --> 0:03:10,156
delivery progress and you have

93
00:03:10,156 --> 0:03:12,076
the option to cancel or restart

94
00:03:12,076 --> 0:03:13,236
deliveries that have not yet

95
00:03:13,236 --> 0:03:13,716
completed.

96
00:03:15,836 --> 0:03:17,546
You also have the option to

97
00:03:17,546 --> 0:03:19,516
verify many packages at the same

98
00:03:19,516 --> 0:03:19,846
time.

99
00:03:20,866 --> 0:03:22,366
Simply drag all of them into

100
00:03:22,366 --> 0:03:24,146
Transporter and click to begin

101
00:03:24,146 --> 0:03:24,756
validation.

102
00:03:25,986 --> 0:03:27,196
That's transporter for Mac.

103
00:03:27,356 --> 0:03:28,796
It's really easy, and I know it

104
00:03:28,796 --> 0:03:30,066
could be a great tool for your

105
00:03:30,656 --> 0:03:30,746
team.

106
00:03:32,756 --> 0:03:34,746
So once your app is uploaded, we

107
00:03:34,746 --> 0:03:37,886
do some further validations and

108
00:03:37,886 --> 0:03:39,036
some issues can only be

109
00:03:39,036 --> 0:03:40,656
diagnosed after we've received

110
00:03:40,656 --> 0:03:41,016
your app.

111
00:03:42,326 --> 0:03:43,926
If we do find any issues, you'll

112
00:03:43,926 --> 0:03:45,276
receive an email to let you

113
00:03:45,276 --> 0:03:48,926
know, and we've recently made

114
00:03:48,926 --> 0:03:50,036
some enhancements to these

115
00:03:50,746 --> 0:03:50,926
emails.

116
00:03:51,736 --> 0:03:53,346
First we added the version

117
00:03:53,346 --> 0:03:54,526
number prominently in the

118
00:03:54,526 --> 0:03:55,256
subject line.

119
00:03:57,636 --> 0:03:59,616
We also added additional context

120
00:03:59,656 --> 0:04:01,016
to help you quickly understand

121
00:03:59,656 --> 0:04:01,016
to help you quickly understand

122
00:04:01,016 --> 0:04:01,446
the problem.

123
00:04:01,996 --> 0:04:05,126
And finally we added numeric

124
00:04:05,126 --> 0:04:06,386
codes for each error.

125
00:04:07,386 --> 0:04:08,406
These will help you find more

126
00:04:08,406 --> 0:04:10,546
details on each error type.

127
00:04:12,036 --> 0:04:14,066
We've also introduced a new way

128
00:04:14,066 --> 0:04:15,386
to view your builds after

129
00:04:15,386 --> 0:04:17,576
they've been uploaded with the

130
00:04:17,576 --> 0:04:19,426
new Build Activity View in App

131
00:04:19,426 --> 0:04:22,546

132
00:04:22,546 --> 0:04:24,016
can see all of the recent builds

133
00:04:24,016 --> 0:04:26,126
that you've uploaded along with

134
00:04:26,126 --> 0:04:27,716
detailed information about each

135
00:04:27,716 --> 0:04:31,176
build as well as the download

136
00:04:31,176 --> 0:04:32,766
and install sizes for each

137
00:04:32,766 --> 0:04:33,356
device model.

138
00:04:35,796 --> 0:04:37,476
In addition to Build Activity,

139
00:04:37,476 --> 0:04:38,896
there's a new notification type

140
00:04:38,896 --> 0:04:41,376
that you can enable called Build

141
00:04:41,376 --> 0:04:42,296
Processing Changes.

142
00:04:43,836 --> 0:04:45,056
This is a great way to be

143
00:04:45,056 --> 0:04:46,566
notified immediately as your

144
00:04:46,566 --> 0:04:47,736
builds finish processing.

145
00:04:51,126 --> 0:04:52,786
Now you've delivered your app

146
00:04:52,786 --> 0:04:54,156
and you're moving from

147

phase.

149
00:04:57,286 --> 0:04:58,466
The next step in the App

150
00:04:58,466 --> 0:04:59,956
Lifecycle is TestFlight.

151
00:05:01,036 --> 0:05:02,116
We've built some exciting new

152
00:05:02,116 --> 0:05:03,836
features for TestFlight and to

153
00:05:03,836 --> 0:05:05,046
tell you all about it I'd like

154
00:05:05,046 --> 0:05:05,976

I'm really excited to be here

161

today to tell you all about

162
00:05:21,136 --> 0:05:23,156
what's new with TestFlight, but

163
00:05:23,156 --> 0:05:25,296
first let's reflect a little

164
00:05:25,806 --> 0:05:25,906
bit.

165
00:05:26,956 --> 0:05:29,236
Last year we introduced Public

166
00:05:29,236 --> 0:05:29,636
Links.

167
00:05:30,286 --> 0:05:32,206
This made it so much easier for

168
00:05:32,206 --> 0:05:34,026
you to invite lots of new people

169
00:05:34,026 --> 0:05:34,966
to test their apps.

170
00:05:35,876 --> 0:05:37,226
All you needed to do is create a

171
00:05:37,586 --> 0:05:39,606
unique URL, you can share it

172
00:05:39,606 --> 0:05:41,906
with anyone, anywhere all

173
00:05:41,906 --> 0:05:42,746
without an email address.

174
00:05:42,746 --> 0:05:45,996
One of the first adopters of

175
00:05:45,996 --> 0:05:48,486
Public Links was Snapchat and

176
00:05:48,486 --> 0:05:49,906
they had some great things to

177
00:05:49,906 --> 0:05:50,286
say.

178
00:05:51,466 --> 0:05:52,516
I'd like to read it to you now.

179
00:05:53,886 --> 0:05:55,366
TestFlight Public Links reduce

180
00:05:55,366 --> 0:05:56,646
friction for our testers.

181
00:05:56,916 --> 0:05:58,716
It increased our tester pool in

182
00:05:58,716 --> 0:06:00,586
a way that's lightweight and

183
00:05:58,716 --> 0:06:00,586
a way that's lightweight and

184
00:06:00,586 --> 0:06:02,766
easier to maintain while

185
00:06:02,766 --> 0:06:03,896
providing us with more than

186
00:06:03,896 --> 0:06:05,076
twice the amount of useful

187
00:06:05,076 --> 0:06:06,056
pre-release feedback.

188
00:06:07,056 --> 0:06:08,036
It's that awesome?

189
00:06:08,796 --> 0:06:10,566
And we've been working harder to

190
00:06:10,566 --> 0:06:12,336
reduce friction for testers even

191
00:06:12,336 --> 0:06:12,756
more.

192
00:06:14,056 --> 0:06:16,306
This year we improved the

193
00:06:16,306 --> 0:06:18,386
TestFlight app by localizing it

194
00:06:18,696 --> 0:06:19,786
in dozens of additional

195
00:06:19,786 --> 0:06:20,166
language.

196
00:06:21,766 --> 0:06:23,636
That means that it's even more

197
00:06:23,636 --> 0:06:25,596
effortless for testers worldwide

198
00:06:25,946 --> 0:06:27,516
to start testing their apps.

199
00:06:28,096 --> 0:06:28,966
And now that you have lots of

200
00:06:28,966 --> 0:06:30,536
new testers, you're probably

201
00:06:30,536 --> 0:06:33,086
eager to hear from them.

202
00:06:33,286 --> 0:06:35,296
We know how important it is for

203
00:06:35,296 --> 0:06:36,636
you to learn about new bugs and

204
00:06:36,636 --> 0:06:38,576
crashes as soon as they happen

205
00:06:38,576 --> 0:06:41,076
during the testing phase, and we

206
00:06:41,076 --> 0:06:42,126
know that sometimes you don't

207
00:06:42,126 --> 0:06:43,276
always get all the detail you

208
00:06:43,276 --> 0:06:44,746
need from your testers when they

209
00:06:44,806 --> 0:06:45,636
send you issues.

210
00:06:46,866 --> 0:06:48,266
So today I'm really excited to

211
00:06:48,386 --> 0:06:49,776
announce something completely

212
00:06:49,776 --> 0:06:50,846
new for TestFlight.

213
00:06:51,356 --> 0:06:52,826
We've printed features that will

214
00:06:52,826 --> 0:06:53,906
improve the beta testing

215
00:06:53,906 --> 0:06:56,146
experience, and we call it

216
00:06:56,146 --> 0:06:57,976
TestFlight Feedback.

217
00:06:58,516 --> 0:07:02,556
[ Applause ]

218
00:06:58,516 --> 0:07:02,556
[ Applause ]

219
00:07:03,056 --> 0:07:04,206
Yeah, these are some great

220
00:07:04,206 --> 0:07:05,856
enhancements that help increase

221
00:07:05,896 --> 0:07:07,456
the quality and quantity of

222
00:07:07,456 --> 0:07:08,916
feedback you receive from your

223
00:07:08,916 --> 0:07:09,796
beta testers.

224
00:07:11,366 --> 0:07:12,976
So now when testers first start

225
00:07:12,976 --> 0:07:14,656
testing your app, they're see a

226
00:07:14,656 --> 0:07:16,486
new onboarding experience that

227
00:07:16,486 --> 0:07:17,986
helps them get up to speed on

228
00:07:17,986 --> 0:07:19,396
what to test and how to start

229
00:07:19,436 --> 0:07:20,486
sending you feedback.

230
00:07:21,486 --> 0:07:23,476
Now there's two new ways to

231
00:07:23,476 --> 0:07:24,416
start sending feedback.

232
00:07:25,426 --> 0:07:27,276
First, testers can send

233
00:07:27,276 --> 0:07:29,476
screenshots to you without ever

234
00:07:29,476 --> 0:07:31,126
leaving your app.

235
00:07:31,786 --> 0:07:34,386
And second, testers are prompted

236
00:07:34,426 --> 0:07:36,556
any time a crash occurs so they

237
00:07:36,556 --> 0:07:37,796
can quickly send you feedback

238
00:07:37,956 --> 0:07:39,126
about that crash.

239
00:07:39,666 --> 0:07:42,356
And we'll also go over new

240
00:07:42,356 --> 0:07:43,476
sections in App Store Connect

241
00:07:43,796 --> 0:07:44,826
that let you manage all the

242
00:07:44,826 --> 0:07:46,186
feedback you collect through

243
00:07:46,186 --> 0:07:48,836
Test Flight, but first let's

244
00:07:48,836 --> 0:07:50,576
take a closer look at how

245
00:07:50,576 --> 0:07:52,306
testers can send you feedback in

246
00:07:52,676 --> 0:07:53,976
a demo on my iPhone.

247
00:08:00,246 --> 0:08:02,736
So, my team invited me to test a

248
00:08:02,736 --> 0:08:03,996
beta version of their app called

249
00:08:03,996 --> 0:08:05,086
Forest Explorer.

250
00:08:05,686 --> 0:08:07,126
It's still early in development

251
00:08:07,126 --> 0:08:08,726
and so there's lots for me to

252
00:08:08,726 --> 0:08:09,706
give feedback on.

253
00:08:10,626 --> 0:08:13,876
Let's start testing it together.

254
00:08:13,876 --> 0:08:15,406
Now when you launch that first

255
00:08:15,406 --> 0:08:17,186
version of an app, you see this

256
00:08:17,186 --> 0:08:18,626
new onboarding screen.

257
00:08:19,336 --> 0:08:20,536
It tells you everything you need

258
00:08:20,536 --> 0:08:22,266
to know to get started and all

259
00:08:22,266 --> 0:08:23,666
you have to do is enter test

260
00:08:23,666 --> 0:08:25,306
notes on the builds in App Store

261
00:08:25,306 --> 0:08:27,086
Connect and it will display

262
00:08:27,086 --> 0:08:27,446
here.

263
00:08:28,516 --> 0:08:29,916
So here I can see that my team

264
00:08:29,916 --> 0:08:31,226
wants me to be on the lookout

265
00:08:31,306 --> 0:08:32,736
for issues in layout and

266
00:08:32,736 --> 0:08:33,436
usability.

267
00:08:34,066 --> 0:08:35,666
Sounds good to me so I'll tap

268
00:08:36,496 --> 0:08:36,645
next.

269
00:08:37,356 --> 0:08:39,186
Here we see steps on how to

270
00:08:39,186 --> 0:08:40,966
start giving feedback just by

271
00:08:40,966 --> 0:08:42,066
taking a screenshot.

272
00:08:42,716 --> 0:08:44,006
I'm excited to give it a try.

273
00:08:44,176 --> 0:08:47,496
So let's start testing.

274
00:08:47,586 --> 0:08:49,096
Here's Forest Explorer.

275
00:08:49,986 --> 0:08:52,246
So you see my photo feed and

276
00:08:52,246 --> 0:08:54,136
some trails on the feed, and

277
00:08:54,136 --> 0:08:55,686
right off the bat I can see that

278
00:08:55,686 --> 0:08:57,786
the Half Dome Trail, it's kind

279
00:08:57,786 --> 0:08:59,296
of darker in text in comparison

280
00:08:59,296 --> 0:09:00,186
to the other trails.

281
00:08:59,296 --> 0:09:00,186
to the other trails.

282
00:09:00,186 --> 0:09:01,946
So this is a good opportunity

283
00:09:01,946 --> 0:09:03,056
for me to send some feedback.

284
00:09:04,146 --> 0:09:06,686
I'll take a screenshot, tap on

285
00:09:06,686 --> 0:09:08,936
the preview, and here when you

286
00:09:08,936 --> 0:09:11,226
tap done, there's a new Share

287
00:09:11,226 --> 0:09:12,716
Beta Feedback Option.

288
00:09:13,346 --> 0:09:14,576
This is available to all beta

289
00:09:14,576 --> 0:09:16,106
apps that's feedback enabled.

290
00:09:17,276 --> 0:09:19,586
Tap on that it opens up a

291
00:09:19,586 --> 0:09:21,066
dialogue for me to enter more

292
00:09:21,066 --> 0:09:21,906
information.

293
00:09:22,676 --> 0:09:24,506
Because I'm a Public Link tester

294
00:09:24,506 --> 0:09:25,756
I have the option to include an

295
00:09:25,756 --> 0:09:27,446
email address with this piece of

296
00:09:27,446 --> 0:09:29,696
feedback, but for now I'll just

297
00:09:29,696 --> 0:09:30,476
add some comments.

298
00:09:31,496 --> 0:09:33,926
The text should be more

299
00:09:33,926 --> 0:09:37,166
consistent with the other trails

300
00:09:38,456 --> 0:09:40,916
and I'll tap submit and that's

301
00:09:40,916 --> 0:09:40,983
it.

302
00:09:41,056 --> 0:09:42,636
I just sent some feedback.

303
00:09:43,516 --> 0:09:46,576
[ Applause ]

304
00:09:47,076 --> 0:09:48,376
Thank you.

305
00:09:48,466 --> 0:09:49,416
Let's keep looking around.

306
00:09:50,716 --> 0:09:52,186
On a trail, I see some trails

307
00:09:52,186 --> 0:09:53,696
that I've saved on this app, and

308
00:09:53,736 --> 0:09:56,626
I can see that the icons on the

309
00:09:56,626 --> 0:09:57,886
lower left are kind of clipped

310
00:09:57,886 --> 0:09:58,706
off-screen.

311
00:09:59,316 --> 0:10:00,966
So this might be a good place

312
00:09:59,316 --> 0:10:00,966
So this might be a good place

313
00:10:00,966 --> 0:10:01,756
for me to send some more

314
00:10:01,756 --> 0:10:02,206
feedback.

315
00:10:02,856 --> 0:10:05,116
I'll take a screenshot and while

316
00:10:05,116 --> 0:10:06,586
I'm at it I'll take a second

317
00:10:06,656 --> 0:10:09,066
screenshot too and that way I

318
00:10:09,066 --> 0:10:11,556
can crop the first one, but

319
00:10:11,556 --> 0:10:12,996
leave the second one intact for

320
00:10:12,996 --> 0:10:13,386
context.

321
00:10:14,566 --> 0:10:17,346
I'll even mark it up just to

322
00:10:17,346 --> 0:10:18,486
point out where the issue is

323
00:10:18,486 --> 0:10:21,056
happening, and I'll tap done and

324
00:10:21,056 --> 0:10:22,066
share beta feedback.

325
00:10:22,656 --> 0:10:24,966
Again, I can include comments

326
00:10:24,966 --> 0:10:27,416
about what the issue is, the

327
00:10:27,416 --> 0:10:29,436
icons are clipped off-screen,

328
00:10:29,966 --> 0:10:32,196
and I'll tap submit.

329
00:10:32,816 --> 0:10:34,896
And that's it.

330
00:10:34,896 --> 0:10:36,536
I've sent multiple screenshots.

331
00:10:36,536 --> 0:10:36,976
Isn't that awesome?

[ Applause ]

333
00:10:42,196 --> 0:10:42,756
Let's keep testing around.

334
00:10:42,756 --> 0:10:44,246
I'll tap on nearby and see what

335
00:10:44,246 --> 0:10:46,716
trails are around and let's find

336
00:10:46,716 --> 0:10:49,456
a Half Dome Trail on the map.

337
00:10:49,456 --> 0:10:50,786
Okay, Forest Explorer just

338
00:10:50,786 --> 0:10:52,676
crashed and this is a new

339
00:10:52,676 --> 0:10:53,626
feature that's a part of

340
00:10:53,686 --> 0:10:54,166
feedback.

341
00:10:54,696 --> 0:10:56,396
Now when your beta apps crash,

342
00:10:56,746 --> 0:10:58,076
testers are prompted to share

343
00:10:58,076 --> 0:10:59,786
feedback about the crash.

344
00:11:00,606 --> 0:11:01,816
So I know my team will want to

345
00:11:01,816 --> 0:11:03,266
know about this so I'll tap

346
00:11:03,266 --> 0:11:05,946
share and here I can include

347
00:11:05,946 --> 0:11:07,546
steps on what caused the crash.

348
00:11:08,616 --> 0:11:09,996
Tapped on the Half Dome Trail

349
00:11:10,616 --> 0:11:13,926
and the app crashed.

350
00:11:14,456 --> 0:11:18,096
And that's it.

351
00:11:18,096 --> 0:11:19,026
I've just sent some crash

352
00:11:19,026 --> 0:11:20,556
feedback to my team and they'll

353
00:11:20,556 --> 0:11:22,086
know where to start debugging

354
00:11:22,166 --> 0:11:23,356
thanks to the feedback I sent.

355
00:11:23,396 --> 0:11:25,926
So I think I'm done testing

356
00:11:25,926 --> 0:11:28,616
Forest Explorer for now, but as

357
00:11:28,616 --> 0:11:31,116
you can see, I've been able to

358
00:11:31,116 --> 0:11:32,306
send a bunch of valuable

359
00:11:32,306 --> 0:11:33,886
feedback in just a few minutes

360
00:11:34,166 --> 0:11:34,946
of testing.

00:11:34,946 --> 0:11:35,866

These are some really great

364

features and sending feedback

365
00:11:43,006 --> 0:11:44,476
through TestFlight has never

366
00:11:44,476 --> 0:11:46,676
been easier and as a developer,

367
00:11:46,676 --> 0:11:47,886
you don't have to do any extra

368
00:11:47,886 --> 0:11:50,046
work to get quality feedback

369
00:11:50,046 --> 0:11:50,866
from your testers.

370
00:11:52,106 --> 0:11:53,756
So finally, let's talk about

371
00:11:53,756 --> 0:11:54,956
managing the feedback in App

372
00:11:54,956 --> 0:11:55,426
Store Connect.

373
00:11:56,916 --> 0:11:58,126
You'll be able to view feedback

374
00:11:58,166 --> 0:11:59,496
submissions shortly after you

375
00:11:59,496 --> 0:12:01,426
receive them and you'll have

376
00:11:59,496 --> 0:12:01,426
receive them and you'll have

377
00:12:01,426 --> 0:12:03,596
helpful filters where you can

378
00:12:03,596 --> 0:12:05,346
find feedback that's important

379
00:12:05,996 --> 0:12:06,976
to you.

380
00:12:07,146 --> 0:12:08,316
Each feedback submission will

381
00:12:08,316 --> 0:12:10,076
include details about the tester

382
00:12:10,076 --> 0:12:12,626
and their device and each

383
00:12:12,626 --> 0:12:13,606
feedback will be available to

384
00:12:13,606 --> 0:12:15,176
download in a zip file.

385
00:12:15,936 --> 0:12:17,836
And in cases where you want to

386
00:12:17,836 --> 0:12:19,656
stop receiving feedback, you can

387
00:12:19,656 --> 0:12:20,496
disable it too.

388
00:12:21,036 --> 0:12:21,976
So let's take a look at these in

389
00:12:21,976 --> 0:12:22,616
more detail.

390
00:12:24,056 --> 0:12:25,426
To manage your crash feedback

391
00:12:25,726 --> 0:12:27,186
just select the Crashes tab in

392
00:12:27,266 --> 0:12:29,486

00:12:29,486 --> 0:12:31,766
view detailed information about

00:12:31,766 --> 0:12:33,116
all the crashes you've received

395
00:12:33,116 --> 0:12:33,916
from your testers.

396
00:12:35,276 --> 0:12:36,636
You can filter crashes by things

397
00:12:36,636 --> 0:12:38,486
like App Version, Build Version

398
00:12:38,486 --> 0:12:40,306
or Device Model to help find

399
00:12:40,346 --> 0:12:41,606
specific crashes you're looking

400
00:12:41,656 --> 0:12:44,596
for, and each piece of feedback

401
00:12:44,966 --> 0:12:46,646
contains useful details about

402
00:12:46,646 --> 0:12:48,456
the tester and their device at

403
00:12:48,566 --> 0:12:49,726
the time of the crash.

404
00:12:50,686 --> 0:12:52,056
So you'll find things like

405
00:12:52,136 --> 0:12:53,686
connection type and free disk

406
00:12:53,686 --> 0:12:55,236
space available or even the

407
00:12:55,236 --> 0:12:57,296
battery life of the device when

408
00:12:57,296 --> 0:12:58,336
the app crashed.

409
00:12:59,106 --> 0:13:00,096
And if you need to share

410
00:12:59,106 --> 0:13:00,096
And if you need to share

411
00:13:00,096 --> 0:13:01,796
feedback with members of your

412
00:13:01,796 --> 0:13:03,076
team outside of App Store

413
00:13:03,076 --> 0:13:05,466
Connect, you can download a zip

414
00:13:05,466 --> 0:13:07,766
file too and it'll include

415
00:13:07,766 --> 0:13:09,416
everything you see plus the

416
00:13:09,416 --> 0:13:10,896
crash log when the crash

417
00:13:10,896 --> 0:13:11,456
happened.

418
00:13:12,306 --> 0:13:13,686
Now it's even easier for you to

419
00:13:13,686 --> 0:13:14,926
track down what caused your app

420
00:13:14,926 --> 0:13:15,586
to crash.

421
00:13:15,696 --> 0:13:18,576
So what about the screenshots

422
00:13:18,856 --> 0:13:20,166
that your testers send you?

423
00:13:21,316 --> 0:13:22,436
Those live in the Screenshots

424
00:13:22,466 --> 0:13:23,476
Tab in TestFlight.

425
00:13:24,006 --> 0:13:26,346
You'll be able to find a gallery

426
00:13:26,346 --> 0:13:28,926
of screenshots feedback that

427
00:13:28,926 --> 0:13:30,086
your testers have submitted.

428
00:13:31,336 --> 0:13:32,746
Just like in crashes you can

429
00:13:32,746 --> 0:13:34,466
filter screenshots by some

430
00:13:34,466 --> 0:13:35,466
helpful filters.

431
00:13:35,746 --> 0:13:37,526
For example, you may want to

432
00:13:37,526 --> 0:13:38,826
look for some feedback from

433
00:13:38,826 --> 0:13:40,436
testers using different devices

434
00:13:40,436 --> 0:13:41,576
than the ones you normally build

435
00:13:41,576 --> 0:13:41,886
with.

436
00:13:43,086 --> 0:13:45,166
So you can select the device

437
00:13:45,236 --> 0:13:47,226
like the iPhone SE, for example.

438
00:13:48,576 --> 0:13:50,066
And now filtered you can

439
00:13:50,066 --> 0:13:52,096
discover any issues on smaller

440
00:13:52,176 --> 0:13:52,596
screens.

441
00:13:52,696 --> 0:13:54,166
So here we see a couple of

442
00:13:54,166 --> 0:13:55,406
screenshots testers have sent

443
00:13:55,406 --> 0:13:56,746
about Forest Explorer.

444
00:13:57,846 --> 0:13:58,966
Let's take a look at one more

445
00:13:58,966 --> 0:13:59,556
detail.

446
00:14:00,846 --> 0:14:02,466
This tester is reporting a major

447
00:14:02,466 --> 0:14:04,156
layout issue similar to the one

448
00:14:04,156 --> 0:14:05,086
we saw earlier.

449
00:14:07,116 --> 0:14:09,156
Screenshot feedbacks contain the

450
00:14:09,246 --> 0:14:10,776
same helpful details that you'll

451
00:14:10,776 --> 0:14:11,926
find in crash feedback.

452
00:14:13,056 --> 0:14:13,896
So you'll find things like

453
00:14:13,896 --> 0:14:15,946
screen resolution, device model

454
00:14:15,946 --> 0:14:18,026
or iOS version of the device.

455
00:14:18,946 --> 0:14:20,046
So paired with screenshots

456
00:14:20,256 --> 0:14:21,486
you'll be able to better

457
00:14:21,486 --> 0:14:23,056
troubleshoot the testers

458
00:14:23,116 --> 0:14:23,506
feedback.

459
00:14:24,216 --> 0:14:26,816
You can also download a zip file

460
00:14:26,866 --> 0:14:28,586
too and it'll include all the

461
00:14:28,586 --> 0:14:29,516
screenshots you see in

462
00:14:29,516 --> 0:14:32,196
TestFlight plus the details that

463
00:14:32,196 --> 0:14:33,156
are in App Store Connect.

464
00:14:34,036 --> 0:14:37,636
If at any point you want to stop

465
00:14:37,636 --> 0:14:39,636
collecting feedback, you can

466
00:14:39,636 --> 0:14:41,306
disable it at the tester group

467
00:14:41,306 --> 0:14:41,756
level.

468
00:14:42,716 --> 0:14:43,976
This means that your testers

469
00:14:43,976 --> 0:14:45,396
will no longer see the

470
00:14:45,396 --> 0:14:47,406
onboarding screen or be able to

471
00:14:47,406 --> 0:14:49,026
send you feedback from directly

472
00:14:49,026 --> 0:14:50,606
within your app, but you can

473
00:14:50,606 --> 0:14:52,146
re-enable this at any time.

474
00:14:52,746 --> 0:14:55,266
So these are some of the ways

475
00:14:55,266 --> 0:14:57,026
you can manage feedback that you

476
00:14:57,026 --> 0:14:58,696
receive through TestFlight and

477
00:14:58,696 --> 0:14:59,296
App Store Connect.

478
00:15:00,106 --> 0:15:01,526
With all these improvements,

479
00:15:01,526 --> 0:15:03,546
you'll be able to receive more

480
00:15:03,546 --> 0:15:05,446
effective feedback at any point

481
00:15:05,446 --> 0:15:07,506
during the testing phase and

482
00:15:07,506 --> 0:15:08,666
testers can start sending you

483
00:15:08,666 --> 0:15:10,356
feedback today.

484
00:15:10,766 --> 0:15:13,106
Anyone running iOS 13 will be

485
00:15:13,106 --> 0:15:14,416
able to use all of these new

486
00:15:14,416 --> 0:15:15,546
features in TestFlight.

487
00:15:17,176 --> 0:15:18,686
We're really excited about

488
00:15:18,686 --> 0:15:21,206
TestFlight feedback, and we want

489
00:15:21,206 --> 0:15:22,976
to start receiving feedback from

490
00:15:22,976 --> 0:15:23,516
you too.

491
00:15:23,516 --> 0:15:26,766
So today we're announcing the

492
00:15:26,766 --> 0:15:28,476
TestFlight Beta Program.

493
00:15:29,076 --> 0:15:30,486
This means that you can get

494
00:15:30,486 --> 0:15:32,106
early versions of TestFlight for

495
00:15:32,106 --> 0:15:34,256
iOS, test the latest features

496
00:15:34,666 --> 0:15:35,666
and give us feedback.

497
00:15:36,646 --> 0:15:38,036
You can sign up for the beta on

498
00:15:38,216 --> 0:15:39,876
a Developer Downloads Page.

499
00:15:40,696 --> 0:15:41,776
We're excited to receive

500
00:15:41,776 --> 0:15:43,306
feedback and help improve

501
00:15:43,306 --> 0:15:44,656
TestFlight even more.

502
00:15:45,116 --> 0:15:46,626
Thank you so much, and I'll give

503
00:15:46,626 --> 0:15:47,676
the stage back to Tommy.

[ Applause ]

505
00:15:55,056 --> 0:15:55,886
Thanks, Payam.

506
00:15:56,256 --> 0:15:57,456
Those are great new ways to

507
00:15:57,456 --> 0:15:59,116
receive feedback about your beta

508
00:15:59,116 --> 0:15:59,496
apps.

509
00:15:59,816 --> 0:16:01,756
After you've received feedback

510
00:15:59,816 --> 0:16:01,756
After you've received feedback

511
00:16:01,826 --> 0:16:03,306
and you've iterated on your app,

512
00:16:03,736 --> 0:16:05,456
it's time to transition to the

513
00:16:05,456 --> 0:16:08,056
App Store, but first something

514
00:16:08,056 --> 0:16:09,956
you'll likely think about is how

515
00:16:09,956 --> 0:16:10,686
to price your app.

516
00:16:11,196 --> 0:16:13,646
The App Store enables you to

517
00:16:13,646 --> 0:16:16,156
generate sales globally to

518
00:16:16,156 --> 0:16:18,556
millions of customers in 155

519
00:16:18,556 --> 0:16:19,266
territories.

520
00:16:19,776 --> 0:16:22,076
We ensure that you can do

521
00:16:22,076 --> 0:16:23,736
business with as many customers

522
00:16:23,736 --> 0:16:25,876
as possible by consistently

523
00:16:25,876 --> 0:16:27,256
adding support for new payment

524
00:16:27,256 --> 0:16:29,716
methods so customers can pay for

525
00:16:29,716 --> 0:16:31,156
your app in whichever method

526
00:16:31,156 --> 0:16:31,686
they prefer.

527
00:16:32,216 --> 0:16:34,796
And with new support for the

528
00:16:34,796 --> 0:16:36,696
Korean won, you can now generate

529
00:16:36,696 --> 0:16:38,706
sales across 45 unique

530
00:16:38,706 --> 0:16:39,316
currencies.

531
00:16:40,756 --> 0:16:42,446
Although you can generate sales

532
00:16:42,446 --> 0:16:44,246
across all currencies, your

533
00:16:44,246 --> 0:16:45,326
business doesn't need to handle

534
00:16:45,326 --> 0:16:48,326
payment for all them because we

535
00:16:48,326 --> 0:16:50,106
consolidate all of your proceeds

536
00:16:50,326 --> 0:16:51,736
into a single payment to your

537
00:16:51,736 --> 0:16:52,306
bank account.

538
00:16:52,806 --> 0:16:55,106
For those of you who offer

539
00:16:55,106 --> 0:16:57,746
subscriptions you have 200

540
00:16:57,746 --> 0:16:58,936
different price tiers to choose

541
00:16:58,936 --> 0:17:02,016
from, and we recently released a

542

from, and we recently released a

543
00:17:02,016 --> 0:17:03,436
feature called Subscription

544
00:17:03,436 --> 0:17:03,986
Offers.

545
00:17:05,455 --> 0:17:06,915
These allow you to offer a

546
00:17:06,915 --> 0:17:08,746
discount or free period of

547
00:17:08,746 --> 0:17:11,996
service for subscriptions and

548
00:17:11,996 --> 0:17:13,636
you decide which subscribers

549
00:17:13,705 --> 0:17:14,846
qualify for the offer.

550
00:17:15,386 --> 0:17:18,336
This is a great way to retain

551
00:17:18,336 --> 0:17:21,406
existing subscribers or to win

552
00:17:21,406 --> 0:17:22,935
back previous subscribers.

553
00:17:28,656 --> 0:17:30,026
There's a lot of great ways to

554
00:17:30,026 --> 0:17:31,576
utilize subscriptions, but I

555
00:17:31,576 --> 0:17:32,726
won't go into detail here

556
00:17:32,726 --> 0:17:34,106
because we have two sessions on

557
00:17:34,106 --> 0:17:35,396
this tomorrow, and I encourage

558
00:17:35,396 --> 0:17:39,206
you to check these out.

559
00:17:39,476 --> 0:17:40,546
Now you've nailed down the

560
00:17:40,546 --> 0:17:42,216
pricing strategy and next

561
00:17:42,216 --> 0:17:43,236
there's something equally

562
00:17:43,236 --> 0:17:45,456
important to think about and

563
00:17:45,456 --> 0:17:46,286
that's how your app is

564
00:17:46,286 --> 0:17:47,696
represented in the App Store

565
00:17:47,696 --> 0:17:49,106
Product Page.

566
00:17:50,196 --> 0:17:51,946
This involves app naming,

567
00:17:52,246 --> 0:17:54,786
description and keywords which

568
00:17:54,786 --> 0:17:56,396
make it easier for customers to

569
00:17:56,396 --> 0:17:59,246
discover your app and when it

570
00:17:59,246 --> 0:18:00,856
comes to reaching as many people

571
00:17:59,246 --> 0:18:00,856
comes to reaching as many people

572
00:18:00,856 --> 0:18:03,036
as possible, a key aspect is

573
00:18:03,036 --> 0:18:03,886
localization.

574
00:18:04,436 --> 0:18:07,306
If we take English as an

575
00:18:07,306 --> 0:18:09,456
example, only about 5% of the

576
00:18:09,456 --> 0:18:11,486
world speaks English as a first

577
00:18:11,486 --> 0:18:11,886
language.

578
00:18:12,576 --> 0:18:13,866
So when you localize your

579
00:18:13,866 --> 0:18:15,246
product page there's a huge

580
00:18:15,246 --> 0:18:16,776
opportunity to reach more

581
00:18:16,776 --> 0:18:17,106
people.

582
00:18:17,656 --> 0:18:20,746
We focus on supporting a lot of

583
00:18:20,746 --> 0:18:22,336
languages, and we recently added

584
00:18:22,336 --> 0:18:23,106
support for more.

585
00:18:23,686 --> 0:18:24,626
To tell you more about these

586
00:18:24,626 --> 0:18:26,186
languages and how you localize

587
00:18:26,186 --> 0:18:27,596
your product page, I'd like to

588
00:18:27,596 --> 0:18:28,486
invite Ethar [phonetic] on

589
00:18:28,486 --> 0:18:28,906

00:18:37,106 --> 0:18:37,636
&gt;&gt; Thanks Tommy.

592
00:18:37,806 --> 0:18:38,796
Salam everyone.

593
00:18:38,956 --> 0:18:40,646
My name is Ethar Elsaka [assumed

594
00:18:40,926 --> 0:18:42,476
spelling], and I'm an engineer

595
00:18:42,576 --> 0:18:43,546
on App Store Connect.

596
00:18:44,316 --> 0:18:46,436
Today we will talk about a very

597
00:18:46,436 --> 0:18:48,066
exciting feature related to your

598
00:18:48,066 --> 0:18:48,896
apps metadata.

599
00:18:49,656 --> 0:18:51,686
We believe that localization is

600
00:18:51,686 --> 0:18:54,586
the key aspect for making your

601
00:18:54,586 --> 0:18:56,396
apps more accessible to the

602
00:18:56,396 --> 0:18:57,266
global audience.

603
00:18:57,876 --> 0:18:59,866
We are always working hard to

604
00:18:59,866 --> 0:19:01,696
introduce new language support

605
00:18:59,866 --> 0:19:01,696
introduce new language support

606
00:19:01,696 --> 0:19:04,976
and just this past year we

607
00:19:04,976 --> 0:19:06,876
introduced nine new languages

608
00:19:08,096 --> 0:19:09,826
bringing the total number of

609
00:19:09,826 --> 0:19:12,276
languages supported by the App

610
00:19:12,276 --> 0:19:13,976
Store to 37 languages.

[ Applause ]

612
00:19:20,146 --> 0:19:22,286
Actually let me pause here and

613
00:19:22,286 --> 0:19:25,106
give you a pop quiz.

614
00:19:25,216 --> 0:19:27,086
Who knows what does aikhtibar

615
00:19:27,086 --> 0:19:27,396
[phonetic] mean?

616
00:19:31,316 --> 0:19:33,586
And what about tatbiq?

617
00:19:35,636 --> 0:19:37,606
So here is your first Arabic

618
00:19:37,606 --> 0:19:38,036
lesson.

619
00:19:38,406 --> 0:19:41,206
Aikhtibar means test and tatbiq

620
00:19:41,206 --> 0:19:42,826
means app.

621
00:19:42,826 --> 0:19:44,436
If you wonder why I give you

622
00:19:44,436 --> 0:19:46,446
this Arabic quiz, this is

623
00:19:46,446 --> 0:19:48,016
because Arabic is one of the

624
00:19:48,136 --> 0:19:50,666
right to left languages and

625
00:19:50,896 --> 0:19:53,076
today I'm very excited to share

626
00:19:53,406 --> 0:19:55,346
that for the first time in the

627
00:19:55,486 --> 0:19:58,706
App Store with iOS 13 we are

628
00:19:58,706 --> 0:19:59,966
supporting Arabic and Hebrew.

their iPhone language to Arabic

632
00:20:14,266 --> 0:20:17,456

preferred language.

635
00:20:20,976 --> 0:20:24,496
As you can imagine, this is not

636
00:20:24,496 --> 0:20:27,036
a small effort and it requires

637
00:20:27,136 --> 0:20:29,316
a rethink of almost every

638
00:20:29,316 --> 0:20:30,956
aspect of display and

639
00:20:30,956 --> 0:20:33,126
interaction, UI layout,

navigation controls, animation

and editorial artwork.

642
00:20:40,816 --> 0:20:42,766
We believe that the presence of

643
00:20:42,766 --> 0:20:45,416
localized app and editorial

644
00:20:45,416 --> 0:20:48,106
content will lead to a deeper

and more integrated experience

00:21:04,966 --> 0:21:07,426
our apps in their native

00:21:07,426 --> 0:21:10,726

655
00:21:15,466 --> 0:21:16,000
can do that.

00:21:24,336 --> 0:21:26,156
will click on my apps, which

665
00:21:43,416 --> 0:21:44,836
don't have forest in Egypt but

that I want to localize and

To summarize, we believe that

a great way to improve

788
00:26:17,926 --> 0:26:21,136
App Store and after your app has

789
00:26:21,136 --> 0:26:22,326
spent some time on the store,

790
00:26:22,706 --> 0:26:24,166
you'll start to receive customer

791
00:26:24,166 --> 0:26:25,436
ratings and reviews.

792
00:26:26,006 --> 0:26:29,266
A great way to see and respond

793
00:26:29,266 --> 0:26:30,696
to reviews is with App Store

794
00:26:30,696 --> 0:26:32,056
Connect for iOS.

795
00:26:32,596 --> 0:26:35,056
You can also enable

796
00:26:35,056 --> 0:26:36,376
notifications for customer

797
00:26:36,376 --> 0:26:37,976
reviews so you can see

798
00:26:37,976 --> 0:26:39,046
immediately when your app

799
00:26:39,046 --> 0:26:40,296
receives a new review.

800
00:26:40,876 --> 0:26:44,416
It's also important to mention

801
00:26:44,536 --> 0:26:46,346
that App Store Connect for iOS

802
00:26:46,556 --> 0:26:48,786
is now a localized app with

803
00:26:48,786 --> 0:26:51,936
support for 14 languages so you

804
00:26:51,936 --> 0:26:53,646
can see that localization is an

805
00:26:53,646 --> 0:26:55,336
important area of focus for all

806
00:26:55,336 --> 0:26:57,026
the tools available to you and

807
00:26:57,066 --> 0:26:57,986
your team.

808
00:27:00,576 --> 0:27:02,486
In addition to customer reviews,

809
00:27:02,486 --> 0:27:04,026
you have another important tool

810
00:27:04,296 --> 0:27:05,636
that can help you decide where

811
00:27:05,636 --> 0:27:06,466
to place your development

812
00:27:06,466 --> 0:27:09,216
efforts and that's analytics.

813
00:27:09,846 --> 0:27:12,396
With App Analytics you get a

814
00:27:12,396 --> 0:27:13,956
wealth of information into how

815
00:27:13,956 --> 0:27:15,966
your app is performing on the

816
00:27:16,506 --> 0:27:17,786
App Store.

817
00:27:17,996 --> 0:27:19,576
We recently added support for a

818
00:27:19,576 --> 0:27:21,636
new platform and that's Mac OS.

819
00:27:21,636 --> 0:27:24,736
So you can access powerful

820
00:27:24,736 --> 0:27:26,126
insight into how your app

821
00:27:26,126 --> 0:27:27,776
performs on the Mac App Store.

822
00:27:28,356 --> 0:27:32,196
Some of the metrics available

823
00:27:32,196 --> 0:27:33,386
for Mac will include

824
00:27:33,386 --> 0:27:35,346
Impressions, which is the number

825
00:27:35,346 --> 0:27:36,876
of times your app icon has been

826
00:27:36,876 --> 0:27:37,576
viewed in the store.

827
00:27:38,026 --> 0:27:41,116
Product Page Views is the number

828
00:27:41,116 --> 0:27:42,266
of times your product page has

829
00:27:42,266 --> 0:27:43,306
been viewed.

830
00:27:44,036 --> 0:27:46,076
App Units shows how many times

831
00:27:46,076 --> 0:27:47,256
your app was downloaded from the

832
00:27:47,256 --> 0:27:47,566
store.

833
00:27:49,676 --> 0:27:52,246
And Sales will capture the total

834
00:27:52,246 --> 0:27:54,426
amount billed through purchases

835
00:27:54,426 --> 0:27:55,596
and in-app purchases.

836
00:27:57,836 --> 0:27:59,546
We're also introducing a

837
00:27:59,546 --> 0:28:01,496
completely new metric for iOS

838
00:27:59,546 --> 0:28:01,496
completely new metric for iOS

839
00:28:01,496 --> 0:28:04,086
Apps called App Deletions.

840
00:28:04,666 --> 0:28:06,866
this will allow you to see the

841
00:28:06,866 --> 0:28:08,356
number of times your app is

842
00:28:08,356 --> 0:28:09,916
uninstalled from customer's

843
00:28:09,916 --> 0:28:10,426
devices.

844
00:28:10,996 --> 0:28:14,286
You might use this to correlate

845
00:28:14,286 --> 0:28:16,636
deletions with an issue in a

846
00:28:16,636 --> 0:28:19,586
recent version of your app.

847
00:28:19,856 --> 0:28:21,706
Or another interesting view is

848
00:28:21,706 --> 0:28:23,886
Deletions by Source Type which

849
00:28:23,886 --> 0:28:25,526
shows if a given source is

850
00:28:25,526 --> 0:28:27,136
better able to retain customers

851
00:28:27,896 --> 0:28:29,856
or what source is resulting in

852
00:28:29,856 --> 0:28:30,746
the most deletions.

853
00:28:33,616 --> 0:28:35,036
There's one more exciting

854
00:28:35,036 --> 0:28:37,206
announcement about Sales Data.

855
00:28:37,856 --> 0:28:39,776
This is an entirely new time

856
00:28:39,776 --> 0:28:41,716
range and level of granularity

857
00:28:41,746 --> 0:28:45,176
for your sales data, the 24-Hour

858

Dashboard.

859
00:28:46,286 --> 0:28:49,416
This gives you an hour by hour

860
00:28:49,416 --> 0:28:51,576
view into the last 24 hours of

861
00:28:51,576 --> 0:28:52,526
sales performance.

865
00:28:58,256 --> 0:28:59,766

your sales data.

869
00:29:03,346 --> 0:29:04,096
Let's take a look at the new

870
00:29:04,096 --> 0:29:04,596
dashboard.

871
00:29:05,176 --> 0:29:08,046
Here we're looking at a sales

872
00:29:08,046 --> 0:29:09,366
overview within Sales and

873
00:29:09,366 --> 0:29:11,296
Trends, and we see sales data

874
00:29:11,296 --> 0:29:13,126
for the last 7 days.

875
00:29:13,736 --> 0:29:15,516
If you filter this view, you can

876
00:29:15,516 --> 0:29:17,156
narrow it down to a handful of

877
00:29:17,156 --> 0:29:18,756
specific in-app purchases.

878
00:29:19,446 --> 0:29:20,876
At the bottom of the list we see

879
00:29:20,876 --> 0:29:22,526
a new in-app purchase that is

880
00:29:22,526 --> 0:29:23,276
just released today.

881
00:29:23,276 --> 0:29:26,336
You see that it doesn't have any

882
00:29:26,336 --> 0:29:27,156
sales data yet.

883
00:29:28,726 --> 0:29:29,856
This is one case where you'll

884
00:29:29,856 --> 0:29:31,226
want to use the 24-Hour

885
00:29:31,226 --> 0:29:31,746
Dashboard.

886
00:29:32,286 --> 0:29:34,936
So if you click on the calendar

887
00:29:34,936 --> 0:29:36,946
picker, you see a new option for

888
00:29:36,946 --> 0:29:38,036
Last 24 Hours.

889
00:29:39,086 --> 0:29:39,876
That will take you to the

890
00:29:39,876 --> 0:29:43,026
24-Hour Graph.

891
00:29:43,226 --> 0:29:45,006
Now you can see sales data on an

892
00:29:45,006 --> 0:29:46,916
hourly basis and you can track

893
00:29:46,916 --> 0:29:48,406
the success of your brand new

894
00:29:48,406 --> 0:29:50,186
in-app purchase as it rolls out

895
00:29:50,186 --> 0:29:50,916
to customers.

896
00:29:51,436 --> 0:29:53,486
You can see how this is a

897
00:29:53,486 --> 0:29:55,066
powerful new way to view your

898
00:29:55,066 --> 0:29:55,726
sales data.

Within the App Lifecycle that

901
00:30:00,056 --> 0:30:02,836
brings us back to Xcode where we

902
00:30:02,836 --> 0:30:03,896
can take everything we've

903
00:30:03,896 --> 0:30:05,296
learned so far and continue

904
00:30:05,296 --> 0:30:07,296
creating great apps.

905
00:30:08,776 --> 0:30:10,766
We have some labs tomorrow at 9

906
00:30:10,766 --> 0:30:12,876
and 3, where you can come ask us

907
00:30:12,906 --> 0:30:14,216
questions about anything we've

908
00:30:14,216 --> 0:30:15,386
talked about.

909
00:30:16,416 --> 0:30:18,296
As always, I can't wait to see

910
00:30:18,296 --> 0:30:19,386
what you do with these new

911
00:30:19,386 --> 0:30:20,176
capabilities.
