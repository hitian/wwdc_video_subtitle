2
00:00:11,166 --> 0:00:12,626
&gt;&gt; Hi. I'm Jacob.

3
00:00:12,766 --> 0:00:14,046
I'm here to tell you about the

4
00:00:14,046 --> 0:00:15,396
Semantic Segmentation Mattes.

5
00:00:15,726 --> 0:00:17,486
So, first, I'm going to go

6
00:00:17,486 --> 0:00:18,676
through what are these new types

7
00:00:18,676 --> 0:00:19,226
of mattes.

8
00:00:19,226 --> 0:00:20,436
And then, David is going to talk

9
00:00:20,436 --> 0:00:21,956
you through how to leverage a

10
00:00:22,006 --> 0:00:23,156
core image to work with these

11
00:00:23,156 --> 0:00:24,316
new mattes.

12
00:00:25,056 --> 0:00:27,846
So, remember in iOS 12, we

13
00:00:27,846 --> 0:00:29,016
introduced the Portrait Effect

14
00:00:29,016 --> 0:00:29,236
Matte?

15
00:00:29,406 --> 0:00:31,376
So, this was a matte designed

16
00:00:31,376 --> 0:00:33,466
explicitly to provide effects

17
00:00:33,706 --> 0:00:34,516
for portraits.

18
00:00:35,036 --> 0:00:36,836
So, we use it internally to

19
00:00:36,836 --> 0:00:38,046
render beautiful looking

20
00:00:38,046 --> 0:00:39,806
portrait mode photos and

21
00:00:39,926 --> 0:00:40,676
portrait lighting photos.

22
00:00:40,676 --> 0:00:44,026
So, in taking a closer look at

23
00:00:44,056 --> 0:00:45,906
the Portrait effect in matte,

24
00:00:46,216 --> 0:00:48,236
you can see how that clearly

25
00:00:48,366 --> 0:00:49,616
delineates the foreground

26
00:00:49,616 --> 0:00:51,356
subject from the background.

27
00:00:51,746 --> 0:00:52,946
So, this is beautifully

28
00:00:52,946 --> 0:00:54,766
represented here as a black and,

29
00:00:54,916 --> 0:00:55,676
black and white matte.

30
00:00:55,976 --> 0:00:57,456
So, values of 1 indicating

31
00:00:57,656 --> 0:00:59,236
foreground and values of zero

32
00:00:59,236 --> 0:01:00,746
indicating background.

33
00:00:59,236 --> 0:01:00,746
indicating background.

34
00:01:01,776 --> 0:01:04,126
In iOS 13, we are taking this a

35
00:01:04,126 --> 0:01:05,186
step further with Semantic

36
00:01:05,186 --> 0:01:06,166
Segmentation Mattes.

37
00:01:07,476 --> 0:01:09,000
So, we're introducing hair,

38
00:01:12,126 --> 0:01:12,660
skin,

39
00:01:14,036 --> 0:01:15,666
and teeth.

40
00:01:17,176 --> 0:01:18,976
So, taking a closer look at the

41
00:01:19,146 --> 0:01:20,526
hair matte, for instance, you

42
00:01:20,526 --> 0:01:22,546
can see how this is beautifully

43
00:01:22,796 --> 0:01:25,006
separating the hair region from

44
00:01:25,006 --> 0:01:25,906
the non-hair regions.

45
00:01:26,256 --> 0:01:28,126
So, we get great hair details

46
00:01:28,126 --> 0:01:29,176
against the background.

47
00:01:29,306 --> 0:01:30,636
And we get great separation

48
00:01:30,636 --> 0:01:32,036
between the non-hair regions

49
00:01:32,036 --> 0:01:34,566
and-- and the hair.

50
00:01:34,566 --> 0:01:35,956
Similarly, for the skin regions

51
00:01:35,956 --> 0:01:37,496
where now we have alpha values

52
00:01:37,496 --> 0:01:39,356
indicating how much of a pixel

53
00:01:39,436 --> 0:01:41,676
is of type skin.

54
00:01:41,676 --> 0:01:43,736
So, so an alpha value of .7, for

55
00:01:43,736 --> 0:01:44,776
instance, would indicate that,

56
00:01:44,776 --> 0:01:47,056
that a pixel is 70% of type

57
00:01:47,056 --> 0:01:47,386
skin.

58
00:01:48,196 --> 0:01:49,546
So, we hope these new three

59
00:01:49,546 --> 0:01:51,226
types, three new types of mattes

60
00:01:51,256 --> 0:01:52,656
will give you the creative

61
00:01:52,656 --> 0:01:55,076
freedom to, to render some cool

62
00:01:55,076 --> 0:01:56,586
effects and beautiful looking

63
00:01:56,646 --> 0:01:57,000
photos.

64
00:01:58,966 --> 0:02:01,006
So, a few things to note is that

65
00:01:58,966 --> 0:02:01,006
So, a few things to note is that

66
00:02:01,006 --> 0:02:02,446
the mattes are half size of the

67
00:02:02,446 --> 0:02:03,206
original image.

68
00:02:03,616 --> 0:02:05,076
That means they are half in each

69
00:02:05,076 --> 0:02:06,406
dimension of the original image.

70
00:02:06,406 --> 0:02:07,376
And that means quarter

71
00:02:07,376 --> 0:02:07,816
resolution.

72
00:02:08,925 --> 0:02:10,536
So, another thing to remember is

73
00:02:10,536 --> 0:02:11,986
that-- that these segmentation

74
00:02:11,986 --> 0:02:13,196
mattes can actually overlap.

75
00:02:13,196 --> 0:02:15,046
So, this is particularly true

76
00:02:15,046 --> 0:02:16,106
for the Portrait Effects Matte

77
00:02:16,106 --> 0:02:17,026
and the Skin Matte that will

78
00:02:17,026 --> 0:02:18,566
inherently overlap.

79
00:02:20,376 --> 0:02:23,146
So, these mattes do not come for

80
00:02:23,326 --> 0:02:23,526
free.

81
00:02:23,526 --> 0:02:24,736
So, we heavily leveraged the

82
00:02:24,736 --> 0:02:26,316
Apple Neural Engines for machine

83
00:02:26,316 --> 0:02:27,576
learning spectral graph theory.

84
00:02:27,666 --> 0:02:29,526
And looking a bit under the hood

85
00:02:29,696 --> 0:02:31,586
what we do is we take the

86
00:02:31,586 --> 0:02:32,546
original size image.

87
00:02:32,616 --> 0:02:33,526
We feed it through the Apple

88
00:02:33,526 --> 0:02:35,016
Neural Engine and together with

89
00:02:35,016 --> 0:02:36,906
the original sized image, we, we

90
00:02:36,906 --> 0:02:38,256
render these high-resolution,

91
00:02:38,546 --> 0:02:40,376
high-quality with high

92
00:02:40,376 --> 0:02:42,036
consistency segmentation mattes.

93
00:02:42,416 --> 0:02:43,296
These are then ready to be

94
00:02:43,296 --> 0:02:44,506
embedded into the HEIF or JPG

95
00:02:44,546 --> 0:02:46,236
files as you know them, together

96
00:02:46,236 --> 0:02:47,456
with the original sized image

97
00:02:47,456 --> 0:02:48,886
and the Depth, as you know, from

98
00:02:48,886 --> 0:02:49,496
iOS 11.

99
00:02:50,126 --> 0:02:53,546
So, there are two distinct ways

100
00:02:53,546 --> 0:02:55,876
to generate these two types of

101
00:02:55,876 --> 0:02:56,216
mattes.

102
00:02:56,216 --> 0:02:57,466
So, so one is that they're

103
00:02:57,466 --> 0:02:58,616
embedded in all Portrait Mode

104
00:02:58,616 --> 0:02:59,216
captures.

105
00:02:59,476 --> 0:03:00,596
So, you can grab them from those

106
00:02:59,476 --> 0:03:00,596
So, you can grab them from those

107
00:03:00,596 --> 0:03:01,016
files.

108
00:03:01,436 --> 0:03:02,816
Or even better, you can write

109
00:03:02,816 --> 0:03:04,236
your won capture app and opt

110
00:03:04,236 --> 0:03:05,566
into these mattes on capture.

111
00:03:05,566 --> 0:03:07,506
So, if you have files with the

112
00:03:07,506 --> 0:03:09,466
segmentation mattes in them, you

113
00:03:09,466 --> 0:03:10,926
can work with them through Core

114
00:03:10,926 --> 0:03:12,026
Image and Image I/O.

115
00:03:12,356 --> 0:03:13,536
David's going to talk more about

116
00:03:13,536 --> 0:03:13,916
that.

117
00:03:14,196 --> 0:03:16,356
But first, I'm going to talk you

118
00:03:16,356 --> 0:03:17,736
through how to capture with AV

119
00:03:17,736 --> 0:03:19,216
Foundation API.

120
00:03:22,196 --> 0:03:23,516
There are four phases we're

121
00:03:23,516 --> 0:03:24,536
going to go through here that

122
00:03:24,606 --> 0:03:25,646
relates to the extension.

123
00:03:25,696 --> 0:03:27,336
So, first, is when we set up the

124
00:03:27,336 --> 0:03:28,416
AVCapturePhotoOutput.

125
00:03:28,866 --> 0:03:30,306
So, again, is when the capture

126
00:03:30,306 --> 0:03:31,886
request is being initiated and

127
00:03:31,886 --> 0:03:33,146
any point in the lifecycle of

128
00:03:33,196 --> 0:03:34,736
your app.

129
00:03:34,736 --> 0:03:35,966
Then, two of the callbacks.

130
00:03:36,046 --> 0:03:37,376
So, one is when the settings are

131
00:03:37,376 --> 0:03:38,716
resolved for your capture.

132
00:03:39,096 --> 0:03:40,476
And the final one is the when

133
00:03:40,476 --> 0:03:42,186
the Photo did finish processing.

134
00:03:42,556 --> 0:03:44,116
So, for, for full details on

135
00:03:44,116 --> 0:03:45,726
this, please, refer to Brad's

136
00:03:45,726 --> 0:03:48,000
2017 talk on this exact topic.

137
00:03:50,576 --> 0:03:52,356
Let's go through how to set up

138
00:03:52,356 --> 0:03:53,926
AVCapturePhotoOutput.

139
00:03:53,926 --> 0:03:55,116
So, this usually happens when

140
00:03:55,116 --> 0:03:56,436
you're, you're setting, you're

141
00:03:56,436 --> 0:03:57,356
configuring your session.

142
00:03:57,356 --> 0:03:59,726
So, you've already at this point

143
00:03:59,726 --> 0:04:00,646
on session dot begin

144
00:03:59,726 --> 0:04:00,646
on session dot begin

145
00:04:00,646 --> 0:04:01,856
configuration, you've set your

146
00:04:01,856 --> 0:04:02,406
presets.

147
00:04:02,406 --> 0:04:03,956
You've added your device inputs,

148
00:04:04,246 --> 0:04:05,026
you add your

149
00:04:05,026 --> 0:04:06,016
AVCapturePhotoOutput.

150
00:04:06,106 --> 0:04:07,606
At this point is when you, when

151
00:04:07,606 --> 0:04:09,856
you tell the API what superset

152
00:04:09,856 --> 0:04:11,016
of segmentation mattes are you

153
00:04:11,046 --> 0:04:12,316
going to ask for at any point in

154
00:04:12,316 --> 0:04:13,806
the lifecycle of your app.

155
00:04:15,036 --> 0:04:16,156
When you actually want to

156
00:04:16,156 --> 0:04:17,375
initiate your capture request,

157
00:04:17,466 --> 0:04:18,416
you need to specify the

158
00:04:18,416 --> 0:04:19,406
AVCapturePhoto setting.

159
00:04:20,046 --> 0:04:21,836
So, this, this is where you tell

160
00:04:21,836 --> 0:04:23,436
the API this is what I really

161
00:04:23,436 --> 0:04:24,816
want in this particular capture.

162
00:04:24,866 --> 0:04:26,756
So, here again, you can specify

163
00:04:27,096 --> 0:04:28,086
all the ones that you already

164
00:04:28,086 --> 0:04:28,466
enabled.

165
00:04:28,856 --> 0:04:30,466
Or you can specify a subset, say

166
00:04:30,576 --> 0:04:31,116
hair or skin.

167
00:04:32,366 --> 0:04:33,966
Now, you initiate your capture

168
00:04:33,966 --> 0:04:34,316
request.

169
00:04:34,696 --> 0:04:35,706
So, you give it the

170
00:04:35,706 --> 0:04:36,816
AVCapturePhoto settings and you

171
00:04:36,816 --> 0:04:38,106
give it the delegate where you

172
00:04:38,106 --> 0:04:39,236
want to have your callbacks.

173
00:04:40,266 --> 0:04:43,926
So, time passes and soon after

174
00:04:44,026 --> 0:04:45,386
you get that, get a

175
00:04:45,386 --> 0:04:47,166
willBeginCaptureFor callback.

176
00:04:47,226 --> 0:04:49,006
This is when, this is when the

177
00:04:49,006 --> 0:04:51,236
API tells you, you may have

178
00:04:51,236 --> 0:04:52,296
asked for something but this is

179
00:04:52,296 --> 0:04:53,116
what you're actually going to

180
00:04:53,116 --> 0:04:53,206
get.

181
00:04:53,646 --> 0:04:54,976
So, this is important for the

182
00:04:55,066 --> 0:04:56,036
Portrait Effects Matte and the

183
00:04:56,036 --> 0:04:57,136
Semantic Segmentation Mattes

184
00:04:57,196 --> 0:04:58,436
because if there are no people

185
00:04:58,436 --> 0:04:59,826
in the scene, you'll actually

186
00:04:59,826 --> 0:05:00,576
not get a matte here.

187
00:04:59,826 --> 0:05:00,576
not get a matte here.

188
00:05:00,956 --> 0:05:02,346
So, you need to check for the

189
00:05:02,386 --> 0:05:03,856
dimension of the-- dimensions of

190
00:05:03,856 --> 0:05:04,826
the Semantic Segmentation

191
00:05:04,826 --> 0:05:05,046
Mattes.

192
00:05:05,046 --> 0:05:09,346
They'll be zero, in such case.

193
00:05:09,566 --> 0:05:10,586
More time passes.

194
00:05:10,966 --> 0:05:12,316
The photo did finish processing.

195
00:05:12,756 --> 0:05:14,876
So, this is when you get your

196
00:05:14,876 --> 0:05:17,376
AV-- AVSemanticSegmentationMatte

197
00:05:17,436 --> 0:05:17,646
back.

198
00:05:17,646 --> 0:05:18,706
This is the variable matte, in

199
00:05:18,706 --> 0:05:19,196
this case.

200
00:05:19,646 --> 0:05:21,796
So, this new class have the same

201
00:05:22,206 --> 0:05:23,876
type of methods and properties

202
00:05:23,876 --> 0:05:24,916
as you know from the Portrait

203
00:05:24,916 --> 0:05:25,316
Effects Matte.

204
00:05:25,386 --> 0:05:26,706
That means you can rotate

205
00:05:26,706 --> 0:05:27,656
according to Exif data.

206
00:05:27,656 --> 0:05:29,296
You can get your CVPixelBuffer

207
00:05:29,296 --> 0:05:31,016
reference or you can get a

208
00:05:31,016 --> 0:05:32,416
dictionary representation for

209
00:05:32,416 --> 0:05:35,596
each file I/O.

210
00:05:35,826 --> 0:05:38,446
So, for a full walkthrough of

211
00:05:38,446 --> 0:05:40,016
the lifecycle of, of how to make

212
00:05:40,016 --> 0:05:41,536
these captures, please refer to

213
00:05:41,536 --> 0:05:42,946
the AVCam sample app.

214
00:05:42,946 --> 0:05:44,526
It has been updated with the

215
00:05:44,526 --> 0:05:45,786
Semantic Segmentation Mattes and

216
00:05:45,786 --> 0:05:47,376
will take you through all these

217
00:05:47,866 --> 0:05:48,576
different steps.

218
00:05:48,756 --> 0:05:51,696
I'm going to hand it over to

219
00:05:51,696 --> 0:05:53,006
David who is going to talk about

220
00:05:53,006 --> 0:05:53,776
the Core Image.

221
00:05:54,516 --> 0:05:59,576
[ Applause ]

222
00:06:00,076 --> 0:06:00,466
&gt;&gt; All right.

223
00:06:00,466 --> 0:06:01,466
Thank you very much.

224
00:06:01,466 --> 0:06:02,456
Now that we've learned how to

225
00:06:02,456 --> 0:06:04,256
capture images with Semantic

226
00:06:04,256 --> 0:06:05,696
Segmentation Mattes, we get to

227
00:06:05,696 --> 0:06:07,266
have some fun and learn how we

228
00:06:07,266 --> 0:06:09,456
can leverage Core Image to apply

229
00:06:09,456 --> 0:06:10,536
some fun effects.

230
00:06:10,926 --> 0:06:12,756
Now, I'm going to have a demo

231
00:06:12,946 --> 0:06:13,496
next.

232
00:06:13,496 --> 0:06:14,686
But I should warn you if--

233
00:06:14,766 --> 0:06:16,386
there's clowns in this image.

234
00:06:16,716 --> 0:06:18,736
So, if you have any coulrophobia

235
00:06:19,076 --> 0:06:20,716
or irrational fear of clowns,

236
00:06:21,126 --> 0:06:22,896
you know, avert your eyes.

237
00:06:23,196 --> 0:06:23,626
All right.

238
00:06:23,626 --> 0:06:24,616
So, here we have an image that

239
00:06:24,616 --> 0:06:26,846
was captured in Portrait Mode on

240
00:06:26,846 --> 0:06:27,346
a device.

241
00:06:27,836 --> 0:06:29,406
And what we can see in this

242
00:06:29,406 --> 0:06:31,656
application is that we can now

243
00:06:31,896 --> 0:06:33,096
very easily see all the

244
00:06:33,096 --> 0:06:34,476
different Semantic Segmentation

245
00:06:34,476 --> 0:06:35,696
Mattes that are present in this

246
00:06:35,696 --> 0:06:36,076
file.

247
00:06:36,726 --> 0:06:39,086
We can use the-- the traditional

248
00:06:39,516 --> 0:06:42,186
Portrait Effects Matte or we can

249
00:06:42,186 --> 0:06:45,416
also see the Skin Matte or we

250
00:06:45,416 --> 0:06:47,736
can see-- the Hair Matte or the

251
00:06:47,736 --> 0:06:48,336
Teeth Matte.

252
00:06:48,816 --> 0:06:50,466
And it's also possible to use

253
00:06:50,466 --> 0:06:51,736
Core Image to combine these

254
00:06:51,736 --> 0:06:53,476
various mattes into other

255
00:06:53,476 --> 0:06:55,046
mattes, such as this one I've

256
00:06:55,046 --> 0:06:57,096
synthesized by using logical

257
00:06:57,096 --> 0:06:59,676
operations to create a matte of

258
00:06:59,676 --> 0:07:00,556
just eyes and mouth.

259
00:06:59,676 --> 0:07:00,556
just eyes and mouth.

260
00:07:01,116 --> 0:07:02,776
If we go back to the main image,

261
00:07:02,776 --> 0:07:04,006
however, we see this is a

262
00:07:04,066 --> 0:07:06,046
picture of me in Apple Park.

263
00:07:06,336 --> 0:07:07,486
And one of the great things you

264
00:07:07,486 --> 0:07:09,306
could do with Semantic-- with

265
00:07:09,406 --> 0:07:11,586
Portrait Effects Mattes is you

266
00:07:11,586 --> 0:07:13,336
could add a background very

267
00:07:13,336 --> 0:07:13,976
easily.

268
00:07:14,076 --> 0:07:15,656
As you can see here, we can put

269
00:07:15,656 --> 0:07:17,586
me in a circus tent.

270
00:07:17,836 --> 0:07:19,486
And while that really does look

271
00:07:19,486 --> 0:07:21,666
like a circus tent, I don't look

272
00:07:21,666 --> 0:07:22,476
like I fit in.

273
00:07:22,816 --> 0:07:24,586
So, now we can use some fun

274
00:07:24,586 --> 0:07:25,086
effects.

275
00:07:25,156 --> 0:07:27,126
For example, we can make it look

276
00:07:27,156 --> 0:07:28,466
like I've got some clown makeup

277
00:07:28,466 --> 0:07:28,706
on.

278
00:07:29,406 --> 0:07:30,476
Or if we want to go a little

279
00:07:30,476 --> 0:07:33,486
further, we can give myself some

280
00:07:33,486 --> 0:07:34,096
green hair.

281
00:07:34,096 --> 0:07:35,716
And lastly, we can use some of

282
00:07:35,716 --> 0:07:37,006
these other mattes to give

283
00:07:37,006 --> 0:07:37,896
myself some makeup.

284
00:07:39,226 --> 0:07:41,596
So, that's what I'd like to talk

285
00:07:41,596 --> 0:07:42,746
to you about today, is how we

286
00:07:42,746 --> 0:07:43,566
can do these kinds of fun

287
00:07:43,566 --> 0:07:44,726
effects in your application.

288
00:07:45,516 --> 0:07:50,546
[ Applause ]

289
00:07:51,046 --> 0:07:51,396
All right.

290
00:07:51,646 --> 0:07:54,436
So, most of the clown references

291
00:07:54,436 --> 0:07:55,536
are gone now so it's safe to

292
00:07:55,536 --> 0:07:56,646
look back.

293
00:07:57,396 --> 0:07:58,016
All right.

294
00:07:58,016 --> 0:07:58,796
So, we're going to be talking

295
00:07:58,796 --> 0:07:59,856
about three things today.

296
00:07:59,856 --> 0:08:01,846
One is how you create matte

297
00:07:59,856 --> 0:08:01,846
One is how you create matte

298
00:08:01,846 --> 0:08:04,146
images using Core Image, how you

299
00:08:04,146 --> 0:08:05,436
can apply filters to those

300
00:08:05,436 --> 0:08:07,426
images, and lastly, how you can

301
00:08:07,426 --> 0:08:08,696
save these into files.

302
00:08:09,186 --> 0:08:10,626
So, firstly, let's talk about

303
00:08:10,626 --> 0:08:12,946
creating matte images using Core

304
00:08:12,946 --> 0:08:13,206
Image.

305
00:08:13,446 --> 0:08:14,316
There are two ways.

306
00:08:14,616 --> 0:08:15,886
One if you can create matte

307
00:08:15,886 --> 0:08:18,116
images by using the

308
00:08:18,116 --> 0:08:19,616
AVCapturePhoto APIs.

309
00:08:20,096 --> 0:08:21,696
And then, from that, you can

310
00:08:21,936 --> 0:08:23,526
create a Core Image.

311
00:08:24,006 --> 0:08:25,086
So, the code for this is very

312
00:08:25,086 --> 0:08:25,486
simple.

313
00:08:25,486 --> 0:08:26,796
What we're going to be doing is

314
00:08:26,796 --> 0:08:28,226
using the Semantic Segmentation

315
00:08:28,226 --> 0:08:30,416
Matte API and specifying that we

316
00:08:30,416 --> 0:08:32,275
want either the hair or the skin

317
00:08:32,366 --> 0:08:32,866
or the teeth.

318
00:08:33,035 --> 0:08:34,946
And that returns an

319
00:08:34,946 --> 0:08:36,645
AVSemanticSegmentationMatte

320
00:08:36,645 --> 0:08:37,176
object.

321
00:08:37,176 --> 0:08:39,356
And from that, it's trivial to

322
00:08:39,356 --> 0:08:41,275
create a CIImage or we can just

323
00:08:41,275 --> 0:08:43,196
substantiate a CIImage from that

324
00:08:43,196 --> 0:08:43,686
object.

325
00:08:44,896 --> 0:08:46,036
The other common way you're

326
00:08:46,036 --> 0:08:47,096
going to want to create matte

327
00:08:47,146 --> 0:08:49,136
images is by loading them from a

328
00:08:49,216 --> 0:08:50,836
HEIF or a JPG file.

329
00:08:51,246 --> 0:08:53,526
These files have a main image

330
00:08:53,596 --> 0:08:54,476
which you're familiar with, a

331
00:08:54,476 --> 0:08:56,036
typical RGB image.

332
00:08:56,306 --> 0:08:57,956
But they also have auxiliary

333
00:08:57,956 --> 0:08:59,516
images such as the Portrait

334
00:08:59,516 --> 0:09:01,736
Effects Matte as well as the new

335
00:08:59,516 --> 0:09:01,736
Effects Matte as well as the new

336
00:09:01,736 --> 0:09:03,696
mattes that we're talking about,

337
00:09:03,746 --> 0:09:06,216
the Skin Segmentation Matte and

338
00:09:06,216 --> 0:09:07,216
the Hair and the Teeth.

339
00:09:08,266 --> 0:09:09,306
The code for this is very

340
00:09:09,306 --> 0:09:09,706
simple.

341
00:09:10,086 --> 0:09:11,606
The traditional code to create a

342
00:09:11,606 --> 0:09:14,036
CIImage from a HEIF file is just

343
00:09:14,036 --> 0:09:16,076
to say CIImage and specify a

344
00:09:16,076 --> 0:09:16,316
URL.

345
00:09:16,956 --> 0:09:18,566
To create these auxiliary

346
00:09:18,566 --> 0:09:20,236
images, all you do is make the

347
00:09:20,236 --> 0:09:22,166
same call and provide an options

348
00:09:22,196 --> 0:09:24,136
dictionary specifying which

349
00:09:24,306 --> 0:09:26,196
matte image you want to return.

350
00:09:26,636 --> 0:09:27,796
So, we can specify the

351
00:09:27,796 --> 0:09:29,866
auxiliarySegmentationHairMatte.

352
00:09:29,866 --> 0:09:32,396
Or if we want, we can get the

353
00:09:32,396 --> 0:09:34,526
mattes for the other Semantic

354
00:09:34,526 --> 0:09:35,316
Segmentations.

355
00:09:36,546 --> 0:09:37,416
So, very simple.

356
00:09:37,416 --> 0:09:39,426
Just couple lines of code.

357
00:09:40,396 --> 0:09:42,016
The next thing we want to do is

358
00:09:42,016 --> 0:09:43,246
talk about how you can apply

359
00:09:43,246 --> 0:09:44,686
effects to these images.

360
00:09:45,206 --> 0:09:46,906
So, I showed a bunch of effects.

361
00:09:46,906 --> 0:09:48,086
I'm going to talk about one in a

362
00:09:48,086 --> 0:09:49,006
little bit of detail.

363
00:09:49,416 --> 0:09:51,186
What we're going to do is we're

364
00:09:51,186 --> 0:09:52,666
going to start with a base RGB

365
00:09:52,666 --> 0:09:53,206
image.

366
00:09:53,316 --> 0:09:54,716
And then, we're going to apply

367
00:09:54,716 --> 0:09:55,716
some effect to that.

368
00:09:55,716 --> 0:09:57,366
Let's say we want to do the

369
00:09:57,366 --> 0:10:00,196
washed-out clown white makeup.

370
00:09:57,366 --> 0:10:00,196
washed-out clown white makeup.

371
00:10:00,376 --> 0:10:01,876
So, I'm going to apply some

372
00:10:01,876 --> 0:10:02,836
adjustments to that.

373
00:10:03,276 --> 0:10:04,376
Those adjustments, however,

374
00:10:04,376 --> 0:10:05,976
apply to the entire image so we

375
00:10:05,976 --> 0:10:07,766
want those to be limited to just

376
00:10:07,766 --> 0:10:08,406
the skin area.

377
00:10:08,976 --> 0:10:10,526
So, we're going to use the Skin

378
00:10:10,976 --> 0:10:11,946
Matte and then, we're going to

379
00:10:11,946 --> 0:10:13,466
combine these three images to

380
00:10:13,466 --> 0:10:14,736
produce the result we want.

381
00:10:16,106 --> 0:10:17,526
Let me walk you through the code

382
00:10:17,526 --> 0:10:18,506
for it because it's actually

383
00:10:18,506 --> 0:10:19,006
quite simple.

384
00:10:20,256 --> 0:10:21,536
But first, I want to talk about

385
00:10:21,576 --> 0:10:22,756
the top feature request we've

386
00:10:22,756 --> 0:10:24,296
had for Core Image which is to

387
00:10:24,296 --> 0:10:25,536
make it easier for people to

388
00:10:25,536 --> 0:10:28,106
discover and use the 200 plus

389
00:10:28,156 --> 0:10:29,386
built-in filters we have.

390
00:10:29,826 --> 0:10:31,216
And that is the new header

391
00:10:31,676 --> 0:10:32,596
called Core mage

392
00:10:32,686 --> 0:10:33,936
CIFilterBuiltins.

393
00:10:34,216 --> 0:10:35,866
And these allow you to use all

394
00:10:35,866 --> 0:10:37,106
of the built-in filters without

395
00:10:37,106 --> 0:10:38,836
having to remember the names of

396
00:10:38,836 --> 0:10:40,026
the filters for the names of the

397
00:10:40,026 --> 0:10:40,366
input.

398
00:10:41,686 --> 0:10:41,836
So.

399

[ Applause ]

400
00:10:45,306 --> 0:10:46,116
It's-- it's really great.

401
00:10:46,706 --> 0:10:48,046
So, let me show you some code

402
00:10:48,046 --> 0:10:49,056
that will use this new header.

403
00:10:49,726 --> 0:10:50,576
So, the first thing we're going

404
00:10:50,576 --> 0:10:51,966
to do is create the base image.

405
00:10:52,036 --> 0:10:52,856
And we're just going to call it

406
00:10:52,856 --> 0:10:54,196
image with contents of URL.

407
00:10:54,246 --> 0:10:56,006
And that will produce the

408
00:10:56,006 --> 0:10:57,356
traditional RGB image.

409
00:10:58,166 --> 0:10:59,296
Now, we're going to start

410
00:10:59,296 --> 0:11:00,306
applying some effects.

411
00:10:59,296 --> 0:11:00,306
applying some effects.

412
00:11:00,376 --> 0:11:01,486
So, the first thing I want to do

413
00:11:01,486 --> 0:11:02,436
is I'm going to convert it to

414
00:11:02,436 --> 0:11:04,296
grayscale and I'm going to use a

415
00:11:04,296 --> 0:11:05,026
filter called the

416
00:11:05,026 --> 0:11:06,016
maximumComponent.

417
00:11:06,726 --> 0:11:08,116
And I'm going to give that

418
00:11:08,116 --> 0:11:09,576
filter an input image of the

419
00:11:09,576 --> 0:11:10,216
base image.

420
00:11:10,786 --> 0:11:11,926
And then, I'm going to ask for

421
00:11:11,926 --> 0:11:13,036
that filter's output.

422
00:11:13,586 --> 0:11:15,056
And that produces the image that

423
00:11:15,056 --> 0:11:16,416
looks grayscale like this.

424
00:11:17,496 --> 0:11:18,716
This doesn't look quite bright

425
00:11:18,716 --> 0:11:20,066
enough to look like clown

426
00:11:20,066 --> 0:11:20,436
makeup.

427
00:11:20,736 --> 0:11:21,636
So, we're going to apply an

428
00:11:21,636 --> 0:11:22,446
additional filter.

429
00:11:22,446 --> 0:11:23,926
We're going to say use the gamma

430
00:11:23,926 --> 0:11:24,766
adjustment filter.

431
00:11:25,256 --> 0:11:26,896
And the input to this will be

432
00:11:26,896 --> 0:11:28,686
the previous filter's output.

433
00:11:28,686 --> 0:11:30,386
And then, we're going to specify

434
00:11:30,666 --> 0:11:32,656
the power for the gamma function

435
00:11:33,476 --> 0:11:35,296
and ask for the output image.

436
00:11:35,996 --> 0:11:37,466
And you'll notice it's now very

437
00:11:37,466 --> 0:11:39,716
easy to specify the power for

438
00:11:39,716 --> 0:11:40,506
the gamma filter.

439
00:11:40,506 --> 0:11:42,086
It's a Float rather than having

440
00:11:42,086 --> 0:11:43,556
to remember to use NSNumber.

441
00:11:43,556 --> 0:11:47,106
So, that's the first part of our

442
00:11:47,106 --> 0:11:47,386
effect.

443
00:11:48,036 --> 0:11:51,146
The next thing we want to do is

444
00:11:51,836 --> 0:11:54,046
start by getting this Skin

445
00:11:54,046 --> 0:11:54,876
Segmentation Matte.

446
00:11:55,276 --> 0:11:56,286
So, again, as I described

447
00:11:56,416 --> 0:11:57,286
earlier, we're going to start

448
00:11:57,286 --> 0:11:59,036
with the URL to specify that we

449
00:11:59,036 --> 0:12:00,746
want the Skin Matte.

450
00:11:59,036 --> 0:12:00,746
want the Skin Matte.

451
00:12:01,156 --> 0:12:03,366
However, when we get this image,

452
00:12:03,966 --> 0:12:05,226
notice it's smaller than the

453
00:12:05,226 --> 0:12:05,716
other image.

454
00:12:05,716 --> 0:12:06,716
As we mentioned before, these

455
00:12:06,716 --> 0:12:07,866
are half size by default.

456
00:12:09,766 --> 0:12:11,096
So, we need to scale it up to

457
00:12:11,096 --> 0:12:12,626
match the image, main image

458
00:12:12,626 --> 0:12:12,916
size.

459
00:12:13,196 --> 0:12:14,176
So, we're going to create a

460
00:12:14,176 --> 0:12:15,666
CGAffineTransform that scales

461
00:12:15,666 --> 0:12:16,956
from the matte's size to the

462
00:12:17,216 --> 0:12:18,146
base image size.

463
00:12:18,566 --> 0:12:20,216
And then, we're going to apply a

464
00:12:20,216 --> 0:12:21,416
transform to the image.

465
00:12:21,416 --> 0:12:22,726
And that produces a new image

466
00:12:22,836 --> 0:12:24,906
which, as you expect, matches

467
00:12:24,906 --> 0:12:25,726
the correct size.

468
00:12:27,216 --> 0:12:28,466
The next step we're going to do

469
00:12:28,746 --> 0:12:30,586
is start combining these two.

470
00:12:31,536 --> 0:12:32,596
And we're going to use the

471
00:12:32,656 --> 0:12:33,946
blendWithMask filter.

472
00:12:34,036 --> 0:12:35,176
And this is great and we use

473
00:12:35,176 --> 0:12:36,536
this throughout the sample I

474
00:12:36,566 --> 0:12:36,936
just showed.

475
00:12:37,936 --> 0:12:38,966
We're going to specify the

476
00:12:38,966 --> 0:12:40,416
background image to be the base

477
00:12:40,456 --> 0:12:42,776
RGB image which looks like this.

478
00:12:43,616 --> 0:12:44,836
Next, we're going to specify the

479
00:12:44,836 --> 0:12:46,506
input image which will be the

480
00:12:46,506 --> 0:12:48,126
foreground image which is the

481
00:12:48,126 --> 0:12:49,986
image which has the-- the white

482
00:12:49,986 --> 0:12:50,726
makeup applied.

483
00:12:50,796 --> 0:12:52,426
And lastly, we're going to

484
00:12:52,426 --> 0:12:55,716
specify a mask image which is

485
00:12:55,936 --> 0:12:57,346
the image that I showed

486
00:12:58,046 --> 0:12:58,496
previously.

487
00:12:59,256 --> 0:13:00,756
Given these three inputs, you

488
00:12:59,256 --> 0:13:00,756
Given these three inputs, you

489
00:13:00,756 --> 0:13:02,246
can ask the blend filter for its

490
00:13:02,246 --> 0:13:04,096
output and the result looks like

491
00:13:04,166 --> 0:13:04,446
this.

492
00:13:05,246 --> 0:13:06,056
Now, as you can see, this is

493
00:13:06,056 --> 0:13:06,926
just the starting point.

494
00:13:06,926 --> 0:13:07,936
You can combine all sort of

495
00:13:07,936 --> 0:13:10,036
interesting effects to produce

496
00:13:10,156 --> 0:13:10,966
great results in your

497
00:13:10,966 --> 0:13:11,466
application.

498
00:13:14,016 --> 0:13:15,396
Once you're done applying these

499
00:13:15,396 --> 0:13:16,426
effects, you want to save them.

500
00:13:17,126 --> 0:13:18,936
And, most typically, you want to

501
00:13:18,936 --> 0:13:21,046
save them as a HEIF or a JPG

502
00:13:21,046 --> 0:13:22,476
file which supports saving

503
00:13:22,746 --> 0:13:24,406
auxiliary images, as well.

504
00:13:25,236 --> 0:13:26,196
So, in addition to the main

505
00:13:26,196 --> 0:13:28,006
image, you can also store the

506
00:13:28,156 --> 0:13:30,006
Semantic Segmentation Mattes so

507
00:13:30,006 --> 0:13:31,716
that either your application or

508
00:13:31,716 --> 0:13:33,456
other applications can apply

509
00:13:33,456 --> 0:13:34,366
additional effects.

510
00:13:36,266 --> 0:13:37,216
The code for this is very

511
00:13:37,216 --> 0:13:37,586
simple.

512
00:13:37,786 --> 0:13:39,776
You use the Core Image API

513
00:13:39,776 --> 0:13:41,366
writeHEIFRepresentation.

514
00:13:41,876 --> 0:13:43,606
And typically, you specify the

515
00:13:43,856 --> 0:13:46,276
main image, the URL that you

516
00:13:46,276 --> 0:13:48,136
want to save it to, and then the

517
00:13:48,176 --> 0:13:49,766
pixel format that you want it to

518
00:13:49,766 --> 0:13:51,646
be saved as, and the colorSpace

519
00:13:51,646 --> 0:13:52,656
you want it to be saved as.

520
00:13:53,206 --> 0:13:54,226
And what I want to highlight

521
00:13:54,226 --> 0:13:56,166
today is another set of options

522
00:13:56,166 --> 0:13:57,506
that you can provide when you're

523
00:13:57,506 --> 0:13:58,326
saving the image.

524
00:13:58,906 --> 0:14:00,546
So, for example, you can specify

525
00:13:58,906 --> 0:14:00,546
So, for example, you can specify

526
00:14:00,546 --> 0:14:01,036
the key

527
00:14:01,036 --> 0:14:02,756
semanticSegmentationSkinMatte

528
00:14:02,936 --> 0:14:05,686
and specify the skinImage or the

529
00:14:05,686 --> 0:14:07,386
hairImage or the teethImage.

530
00:14:07,696 --> 0:14:09,036
And all four of these images

531
00:14:09,036 --> 0:14:10,536
will be saved into the resulting

532
00:14:11,066 --> 0:14:12,246
HEIF or JPG file.

533
00:14:13,486 --> 0:14:14,686
Now, there's an alternate way of

534
00:14:14,746 --> 0:14:16,726
getting this result, which is,

535
00:14:16,726 --> 0:14:18,086
if you want, you can save the

536
00:14:18,086 --> 0:14:20,626
main images and specify the

537
00:14:20,626 --> 0:14:21,936
segmentation mattes as

538
00:14:21,936 --> 0:14:23,646
AVSemanticSegmentationMatte

539
00:14:23,646 --> 0:14:24,196
objects.

540
00:14:24,666 --> 0:14:26,066
This again, the API is very

541
00:14:26,066 --> 0:14:26,456
simple.

542
00:14:26,756 --> 0:14:29,016
You specify the-- the URL, the

543
00:14:29,016 --> 0:14:31,056
primary image, the pixel format,

544
00:14:31,416 --> 0:14:32,306
and the color space.

545
00:14:32,896 --> 0:14:34,126
In this case, if you want to

546
00:14:34,126 --> 0:14:35,486
specify these objects to be

547
00:14:35,486 --> 0:14:37,776
saved in the file, you just say

548
00:14:37,776 --> 0:14:39,376
AVSemanticSegmentationMattes and

549
00:14:39,376 --> 0:14:40,986
you provide an array of mattes.

550
00:14:43,396 --> 0:14:45,676
So, that's what you can do using

551
00:14:45,676 --> 0:14:46,776
Core Image with these mattes.

552
00:14:46,776 --> 0:14:48,296
What I talked about today is how

553
00:14:48,296 --> 0:14:50,646
to create images for-- for

554
00:14:50,746 --> 0:14:52,456
mattes, how to apply filters,

555
00:14:52,556 --> 0:14:53,436
and how to save them.

556
00:14:53,756 --> 0:14:54,906
I will, however, mention that

557
00:14:54,956 --> 0:14:56,616
the sample app I showed you has

558
00:14:56,616 --> 0:14:58,316
been written as a Photos App

559
00:14:58,316 --> 0:14:58,796
plug-in.

560
00:14:59,216 --> 0:15:00,236
And if you want to learn about

561
00:14:59,216 --> 0:15:00,236
And if you want to learn about

562
00:15:00,236 --> 0:15:01,346
how you can do that in your

563
00:15:01,346 --> 0:15:03,176
application so that you can save

564
00:15:03,176 --> 0:15:04,596
these images, not just to HEIFs

565
00:15:04,646 --> 0:15:06,226
but, also, into the user's Photo

566
00:15:06,226 --> 0:15:08,596
library, I recommend you consult

567
00:15:08,596 --> 0:15:10,326
these earlier presentations.

568
00:15:10,576 --> 0:15:11,846
Especially, the "Introduction to

569
00:15:11,846 --> 0:15:13,836
the Photos Frameworks" from WWDC

570
00:15:13,836 --> 0:15:16,866
in 2014.

571
00:15:16,996 --> 0:15:17,276
All right.

572
00:15:17,276 --> 0:15:18,556
And thank you all, very much, I

573
00:15:18,556 --> 0:15:19,606
really look forward to seeing

574
00:15:19,606 --> 0:15:20,436
what you do with these great

575
00:15:20,436 --> 0:15:20,636
features.

576
00:15:20,636 --> 0:15:20,866
Thanks.
