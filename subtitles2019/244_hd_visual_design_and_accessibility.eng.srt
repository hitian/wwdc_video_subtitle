00:00:14,436 --> 0:00:16,646
&gt;&gt; Hi, everyone, my name is

3
00:00:16,706 --> 0:00:18,016
Sommer Panage, and I'm

4
00:00:18,016 --> 0:00:19,246
Engineering Manager on the

5
00:00:19,246 --> 0:00:20,216
Accessibility Team.

6
00:00:21,186 --> 0:00:22,586
I'm excited to share with you

7
00:00:22,846 --> 0:00:24,626
three ways in which you can make

8
00:00:24,626 --> 0:00:26,146
your apps more visually

9
00:00:26,416 --> 0:00:27,000
accessible.

10
00:00:28,176 --> 0:00:29,516
We will be covering Dynamic Type

11
00:00:30,116 --> 0:00:31,266
as well as some great

12
00:00:31,266 --> 0:00:32,756
improvements to Reduce Motion

13
00:00:33,386 --> 0:00:35,296
and an API that we brought over

14
00:00:35,296 --> 0:00:37,826
from Mac to iOS that we call

15
00:00:37,826 --> 0:00:39,006
Differentiate Without Color.

16
00:00:40,796 --> 0:00:41,896
So let's get started with

17
00:00:41,896 --> 0:00:42,576
Dynamic Type.

18
00:00:44,046 --> 0:00:45,676
Dynamic Type is a feature that

19
00:00:45,676 --> 0:00:47,926
allows users to customize the

20
00:00:48,006 --> 0:00:49,296
size of the text on their

21
00:00:49,296 --> 0:00:49,746
screen.

22
00:00:50,906 --> 0:00:52,136
Now for some users that might

23
00:00:52,136 --> 0:00:54,906
mean smaller text and for others

24
00:00:55,176 --> 0:00:56,026
that might be larger text.

25
00:00:57,216 --> 0:00:59,366
Now for some larger text might

26
00:00:59,366 --> 0:01:01,746
just be a preference, but for

27
00:00:59,366 --> 0:01:01,746
just be a preference, but for

28
00:01:01,746 --> 0:01:03,966
others large text can be the

29
00:01:03,966 --> 0:01:05,606
difference between being unable

30
00:01:05,606 --> 0:01:07,996
to use their device and being

31
00:01:07,996 --> 0:01:08,716
able to use it.

32
00:01:11,136 --> 0:01:12,366
When you're implementing Dynamic

33
00:01:12,466 --> 0:01:14,376
Type for your users, I'd like to

34
00:01:14,376 --> 0:01:16,326
remind you of four important

35
00:01:16,326 --> 0:01:16,796
principles.

36
00:01:18,216 --> 0:01:21,456
First, you make as much of your

37
00:01:21,456 --> 0:01:23,206
text dynamic as possible.

38
00:01:23,766 --> 0:01:26,026
If the text can grow, it should grow.

39
00:01:27,666 --> 0:01:29,786
Second, use as much of the

40
00:01:29,896 --> 0:01:31,346
screen width as possible.

41
00:01:33,026 --> 0:01:35,976
Third, don't truncate text as it

42
00:01:35,976 --> 0:01:36,336
grows.

43
00:01:36,896 --> 0:01:38,246
You'll want to display the same

44
00:01:38,246 --> 0:01:40,266
amount of text as your default UI.

45
00:01:41,736 --> 0:01:43,476
And, finally, you should scale

46
00:01:43,476 --> 0:01:44,856
glyphs that appear next to text

47
00:01:46,036 --> 0:01:47,636
so that your UI continues to

48
00:01:47,636 --> 0:01:48,176
look balanced.

49
00:01:50,486 --> 0:01:52,736
In iOS, there are 11 different

50
00:01:52,806 --> 0:01:54,076
text styles that you can use

51
00:01:54,076 --> 0:01:55,726
with Dynamic Type all the way

52
00:01:55,726 --> 0:01:57,676
from titles down the captions

53
00:01:57,856 --> 0:01:58,256
and footnotes.

54
00:02:00,816 --> 0:02:02,636
To use Dynamic Type for your UI

55
00:02:02,636 --> 0:02:05,016
labels, your UI text fields, and

56
00:02:05,016 --> 0:02:06,866
your UI text views, you just

57
00:02:06,866 --> 0:02:08,846
need to use a preferred font for

58
00:02:08,846 --> 0:02:10,985
one of these text styles and

59
00:02:11,356 --> 0:02:12,816
you'll want to set the adjust

60
00:02:13,156 --> 0:02:15,086
font for content size categories

61
00:02:15,086 --> 0:02:17,066
flag to true on those views.

62
00:02:17,916 --> 0:02:19,366
This guarantees that your view

63
00:02:19,696 --> 0:02:21,476
will update whenever the user

64
00:02:21,476 --> 0:02:23,736
changes their font size even if

65
00:02:23,736 --> 0:02:24,806
your app is in the foreground.

66
00:02:26,796 --> 0:02:29,086
As of iOS 11, we made it easier

67
00:02:29,086 --> 0:02:30,916
for you to use Dynamic Type with

68
00:02:30,916 --> 0:02:32,146
your custom fonts as well.

69
00:02:33,476 --> 0:02:35,336
You'll want to have one font and

70
00:02:35,336 --> 0:02:37,536
size mapped to each of the 11

71
00:02:37,636 --> 0:02:39,356
text styles that we saw

72
00:02:39,356 --> 0:02:39,886
previously.

73
00:02:41,096 --> 0:02:43,106
Here I create my own dictionary

74
00:02:43,106 --> 0:02:44,266
of fonts for each style.

75
00:02:45,876 --> 0:02:47,846
Then I can look to see if I have

76
00:02:47,846 --> 0:02:49,186
a font for the given style.

77
00:02:50,226 --> 0:02:51,686
If I do, then I scale it as

78
00:02:51,816 --> 0:02:53,516
appropriate using UI font

79
00:02:53,516 --> 0:02:56,386
metrics, and if not, then I fall

80
00:02:56,386 --> 0:02:58,446
back to that preferred system

81
00:02:58,446 --> 0:02:58,696
font.

82
00:03:00,956 --> 0:03:02,466
As I'm doing my awesome Dynamic

83
00:03:02,576 --> 0:03:04,496
Type work, I want to be able to

84
00:03:04,496 --> 0:03:06,096
see it and I can now easily

85
00:03:06,096 --> 0:03:08,436
preview it using the new Xcode

86
00:03:08,436 --> 0:03:09,966
environments overwrites pane

87
00:03:10,426 --> 0:03:10,776
seen here.

88
00:03:10,776 --> 0:03:12,746
I can just slide the Dynamic

89
00:03:12,796 --> 0:03:15,016
Type slider and instantly in the

90
00:03:15,016 --> 0:03:17,000
simulator see the results.

91
00:03:19,656 --> 0:03:21,116
Next, I'd like to talk to you

92
00:03:21,316 --> 0:03:22,156
about reduced motion.

93
00:03:23,536 --> 0:03:25,606
So, motion is often an exciting

94
00:03:25,646 --> 0:03:27,126
and dynamic part of iOS.

95
00:03:28,046 --> 0:03:29,716
We use motion in many places to

96
00:03:29,716 --> 0:03:30,696
create a more immersive

97
00:03:30,696 --> 0:03:31,986
experience for our customers.

98
00:03:33,626 --> 0:03:35,596
However, for some users these

99
00:03:35,596 --> 0:03:37,076
effects might not be desirable.

100
00:03:37,926 --> 0:03:39,556
One in three people has some

101
00:03:39,556 --> 0:03:40,836
form of motion sensitivity.

102
00:03:41,396 --> 0:03:43,216
Now for most people this means

103
00:03:43,216 --> 0:03:44,876
riding a roller coaster or maybe

104
00:03:44,876 --> 0:03:46,616
reading a book in the car, but

105
00:03:46,616 --> 0:03:48,166
for a small subset of people

106
00:03:48,166 --> 0:03:50,176
that sensitivity could be

107
00:03:50,176 --> 0:03:51,816
triggered by even looking at a

108
00:03:51,926 --> 0:03:52,966
screen with motion on it.

109
00:03:55,446 --> 0:03:57,236
To help iOS adapt to all

110
00:03:57,236 --> 0:03:59,046
customers, we already provide a

111
00:03:59,046 --> 0:04:00,966
reduced motion setting in our

112
00:03:59,046 --> 0:04:00,966
reduced motion setting in our

113
00:04:00,966 --> 0:04:02,346
accessibility settings to

114
00:04:02,346 --> 0:04:04,056
disable things like weather and

115
00:04:04,056 --> 0:04:05,466
parallax effects in the system.

116
00:04:07,176 --> 0:04:08,716
And here's the reduce motion API

117
00:04:09,016 --> 0:04:10,056
that you might already be

118
00:04:10,056 --> 0:04:10,606
familiar with.

119
00:04:11,676 --> 0:04:13,686
When reduced motion is on, your

120
00:04:13,686 --> 0:04:15,176
app should adapt its animations

121
00:04:15,176 --> 0:04:15,516
as well.

122
00:04:17,856 --> 0:04:19,456
Now another motion effect is

123
00:04:19,555 --> 0:04:20,636
autoplaying video.

124
00:04:21,416 --> 0:04:23,176
Here we see that as we scroll

125
00:04:23,176 --> 0:04:24,916
through the App Store trailers

126
00:04:25,016 --> 0:04:26,716
for the featured games begin to

127
00:04:26,716 --> 0:04:26,836
play.

128
00:04:28,166 --> 0:04:29,646
Now while for some this might

129
00:04:29,646 --> 0:04:30,946
make them want to click in and

130
00:04:30,946 --> 0:04:32,026
learn more about a fun looking

131
00:04:32,026 --> 0:04:34,056
game; for others this behavior

132
00:04:34,056 --> 0:04:35,906
could be a bit jarring or

133
00:04:35,906 --> 0:04:36,846
perhaps it could trigger some

134
00:04:36,846 --> 0:04:37,396
anxiety.

135
00:04:39,096 --> 0:04:41,156
So that users can decide if they

136
00:04:41,156 --> 0:04:42,706
want to see autoplaying video,

137
00:04:43,006 --> 0:04:44,936
we're excited to announce a new

138
00:04:44,936 --> 0:04:46,616
motion setting this year for iOS

139
00:04:46,666 --> 0:04:47,056
13.

140
00:04:48,066 --> 0:04:49,936
Settings, accessibility, motion,

141
00:04:50,336 --> 0:04:51,446
auto-play video previews.

142
00:04:52,606 --> 0:04:54,786
With this setting disabled our

143
00:04:54,786 --> 0:04:57,146
apps such as App Store will no

144
00:04:57,146 --> 0:04:58,406
longer auto-play content like

145
00:04:58,406 --> 0:05:00,246
trailers but rather they will

146
00:04:58,406 --> 0:05:00,246
trailers but rather they will

147
00:05:00,246 --> 0:05:01,756
require user interaction to

148
00:05:01,756 --> 0:05:02,606
start and stop playback.

149
00:05:03,866 --> 0:05:05,756
Auto-play video previews starts

150
00:05:05,756 --> 0:05:08,006
as enabled by default, but you

151
00:05:08,006 --> 0:05:10,516
can turn it off at any time.

152
00:05:10,516 --> 0:05:11,856
And, additionally, we've made

153
00:05:11,856 --> 0:05:12,806
this public API.

154
00:05:14,136 --> 0:05:16,336
If is video auto-play enabled is

155
00:05:16,426 --> 0:05:18,206
false, you should also make sure

156
00:05:18,206 --> 0:05:19,576
that any videos in your apps

157
00:05:19,806 --> 0:05:21,446
provide a play or pause

158
00:05:21,446 --> 0:05:22,686
avoidance to your users.

159
00:05:23,606 --> 0:05:24,656
And, of course, always listen

160
00:05:24,656 --> 0:05:26,116
for that notification to know

161
00:05:26,116 --> 0:05:26,876
when you should change your

162
00:05:26,876 --> 0:05:27,266
behavior.

163
00:05:29,116 --> 0:05:31,246
Now if your app already provides

164
00:05:31,246 --> 0:05:32,976
an in-app setting, you'll simply

165
00:05:32,976 --> 0:05:34,876
want to mirror that, mirror our

166
00:05:34,876 --> 0:05:36,336
global setting as your default.

167
00:05:37,096 --> 0:05:39,466
However, you can still use the

168
00:05:39,466 --> 0:05:40,566
setting in your app to allow

169
00:05:40,566 --> 0:05:41,536
users to customize your

170
00:05:41,536 --> 0:05:41,926
behavior.

171
00:05:43,386 --> 0:05:45,746
Another form of motion in iOS is

172
00:05:45,746 --> 0:05:48,116
a transition from one screen to

173
00:05:48,116 --> 0:05:48,386
another.

174
00:05:49,306 --> 0:05:51,716
Here we see the typical sliding

175
00:05:51,716 --> 0:05:53,026
transition as we navigate

176
00:05:53,026 --> 0:05:54,886
through our settings app.

177
00:06:00,156 --> 0:06:01,206
To provide even more

178
00:06:01,376 --> 0:06:03,326
fine-grained control over the

179
00:06:03,416 --> 0:06:04,896
types of motion that a customer

180
00:06:04,936 --> 0:06:06,696
experiences on iOS, we've

181
00:06:06,696 --> 0:06:08,436
introduced an additional setting

182
00:06:08,656 --> 0:06:10,146
when reduced motion is enabled

183
00:06:10,836 --> 0:06:12,356
and this is called prefer

184
00:06:12,356 --> 0:06:13,516
Cross-fade Transitions.

185
00:06:14,346 --> 0:06:16,536
As you can see, by enabling that

186
00:06:16,536 --> 0:06:19,076
setting, my lateral slides have

187
00:06:19,076 --> 0:06:20,976
become dissolved transitions in

188
00:06:20,976 --> 0:06:21,106
the app.

189
00:06:22,166 --> 0:06:23,636
Now UIKit implements these

190
00:06:23,636 --> 0:06:25,076
dissolved transitions for you

191
00:06:25,186 --> 0:06:26,346
when the setting is enabled.

192
00:06:26,816 --> 0:06:28,846
So as long as you're using UIKit

193
00:06:28,846 --> 0:06:30,586
standard navigation or modal

194
00:06:30,586 --> 0:06:31,886
presentation, you'll get this

195
00:06:31,886 --> 0:06:33,000
behavior for free.

196
00:06:35,396 --> 0:06:37,046
Finally, I'd like to talk to you

197
00:06:37,116 --> 0:06:38,266
about Differentiate Without

198
00:06:38,266 --> 0:06:38,546
Color.

199
00:06:40,646 --> 0:06:42,346
So colorblindness might cause

200
00:06:42,516 --> 0:06:44,006
numerous colors that appear

201
00:06:44,056 --> 0:06:46,906
different to some to appear very

202
00:06:46,906 --> 0:06:47,926
similar to others.

203
00:06:48,906 --> 0:06:50,296
For those with deuteranopia, for

204
00:06:50,296 --> 0:06:52,656
example, some reds and greens

205
00:06:52,716 --> 0:06:54,616
and yellows might all look very

206
00:06:54,616 --> 0:06:55,226
much the same.

207
00:06:56,306 --> 0:06:57,646
To see how this might impact

208
00:06:57,716 --> 0:06:59,306
users and how we're solving for

209
00:06:59,306 --> 0:07:00,806
it, I'd like to show you this

210
00:06:59,306 --> 0:07:00,806
it, I'd like to show you this

211
00:07:00,806 --> 0:07:02,146
little app that my colleagues

212
00:07:02,146 --> 0:07:02,766
and I worked on.

213
00:07:03,656 --> 0:07:05,716
So we all really like peanut

214
00:07:05,806 --> 0:07:07,486
butter, and I just added a new

215
00:07:07,546 --> 0:07:09,266
feature so that I can track my

216
00:07:09,406 --> 0:07:10,596
personal peanut butter status.

217
00:07:11,206 --> 0:07:12,516
I've added green circles to the

218
00:07:12,556 --> 0:07:13,836
peanut butters that I currently

219
00:07:13,836 --> 0:07:16,576
have, I've added yellow circles

220
00:07:16,706 --> 0:07:17,606
to the ones where I've eaten

221
00:07:17,606 --> 0:07:18,616
them before but I don't have

222
00:07:18,616 --> 0:07:20,216
them right now, and I've added

223
00:07:20,216 --> 0:07:21,076
red circles for the ones I

224
00:07:21,166 --> 0:07:21,806
haven't tried yet.

225
00:07:23,446 --> 0:07:24,806
Now if my friend wants to use

226
00:07:24,806 --> 0:07:26,456
this app but they happen to be

227
00:07:26,456 --> 0:07:28,186
colorblind, this might be how it

228
00:07:28,186 --> 0:07:28,536
looks.

229
00:07:29,086 --> 0:07:30,146
As you can see, all of the

230
00:07:30,236 --> 0:07:31,486
circles kind of blend together.

231
00:07:33,816 --> 0:07:36,576
Now, as of iOS 13, this user can

232
00:07:36,576 --> 0:07:37,446
go over to settings,

233
00:07:37,746 --> 0:07:39,426
accessibility, display in text

234
00:07:39,586 --> 0:07:41,546
size and turn this on --

235
00:07:42,106 --> 0:07:43,116
Differentiate Without Color.

236
00:07:44,546 --> 0:07:48,496
As a developer, I can just check

237
00:07:48,976 --> 0:07:50,256
should Differentiate, Without

238
00:07:50,256 --> 0:07:51,936
Color and observe the

239
00:07:51,936 --> 0:07:53,316
Differentiate Without Color to

240
00:07:53,316 --> 0:07:54,266
change notification.

241
00:07:55,296 --> 0:07:56,926
If the setting is true, any

242
00:07:56,926 --> 0:07:58,476
place in my app where I use

243
00:07:58,476 --> 0:08:00,176
color as the only way of

244
00:07:58,476 --> 0:08:00,176
color as the only way of

245
00:08:00,216 --> 0:08:02,016
conveying information, I should

246
00:08:02,016 --> 0:08:03,106
now add some additional

247
00:08:03,106 --> 0:08:03,646
indicator.

248
00:08:04,196 --> 0:08:05,366
For example, a shape.

249
00:08:07,156 --> 0:08:09,816
So back to my peanut butter app,

250
00:08:09,816 --> 0:08:10,836
when I see that the user has

251
00:08:10,976 --> 0:08:12,226
turned on Differentiate Without

252
00:08:12,226 --> 0:08:14,376
Color I now replace my circles

253
00:08:14,646 --> 0:08:17,526
with a green check, a yellow

254
00:08:17,526 --> 0:08:22,176
question mark and a red X.

255
00:08:22,966 --> 0:08:24,356
So now even if the app appears

256
00:08:24,356 --> 0:08:26,566
like this, we can still discern

257
00:08:26,566 --> 0:08:27,706
the status of my different

258
00:08:27,706 --> 0:08:28,236
peanut butters.

259
00:08:29,446 --> 0:08:31,016
Now you might be thinking, hey,

260
00:08:31,016 --> 0:08:31,766
Sommer, wait a minute.

261
00:08:32,366 --> 0:08:33,606
The app actually just looks

262
00:08:33,606 --> 0:08:34,385
better this way.

263
00:08:34,546 --> 0:08:36,176
Why even bother with the plain

264
00:08:36,246 --> 0:08:36,885
circle version?

265
00:08:37,756 --> 0:08:38,806
And you'd be totally right.

266
00:08:39,986 --> 0:08:42,436
In fact, when possible, you

267
00:08:42,436 --> 0:08:43,966
should not rely on color alone

268
00:08:43,966 --> 0:08:44,896
to signal meaning.

269
00:08:45,716 --> 0:08:46,826
Now in the case of my peanut

270
00:08:46,826 --> 0:08:48,116
butter app, that's easy.

271
00:08:48,206 --> 0:08:49,116
I can just get rid of the

272
00:08:49,116 --> 0:08:51,076
circles, but it's not always

273
00:08:51,076 --> 0:08:51,726
that easy.

274
00:08:53,746 --> 0:08:55,266
Here we see the game Causality.

275
00:08:56,576 --> 0:08:57,876
The game play is actually

276
00:08:57,876 --> 0:08:59,396
indicated by the color on the

277
00:08:59,486 --> 0:08:59,856
screen.

278
00:09:00,976 --> 0:09:02,336
Now this might not be enough

279
00:09:02,336 --> 0:09:04,956
information for all users and so

280
00:09:04,956 --> 0:09:06,466
the game creators provide a

281
00:09:06,566 --> 0:09:07,636
colorblind mode that you see

282
00:09:07,636 --> 0:09:08,156
here.

283
00:09:10,026 --> 0:09:11,756
When that's enabled, the players

284
00:09:11,756 --> 0:09:12,836
and the targets now have

285
00:09:12,896 --> 0:09:14,926
symbolic flags above their heads

286
00:09:15,296 --> 0:09:15,986
and associated.

287
00:09:17,456 --> 0:09:18,586
The game designers might not

288
00:09:18,586 --> 0:09:20,366
have wanted this extra symbol

289
00:09:20,366 --> 0:09:22,116
noise in the original design,

290
00:09:23,196 --> 0:09:25,296
but for some users this actually

291
00:09:25,356 --> 0:09:26,956
is what makes the game playable.

292
00:09:28,246 --> 0:09:29,656
And that's it.

293
00:09:29,656 --> 0:09:32,866
With that we've seen three ways

294
00:09:33,116 --> 0:09:34,706
that we can make our apps more

295
00:09:34,706 --> 0:09:36,456
visually accessible to all of

296
00:09:36,456 --> 0:09:37,056
our customers.

297
00:09:38,276 --> 0:09:39,716
We can support all text sizes

298
00:09:39,876 --> 0:09:42,266
with Dynamic Type, we can adapt

299
00:09:42,616 --> 0:09:44,386
via new motion settings for our

300
00:09:44,386 --> 0:09:45,766
customers that might have motion

301
00:09:45,766 --> 0:09:49,196
sensitivities, and we can convey

302
00:09:49,196 --> 0:09:50,596
information in different ways

303
00:09:50,856 --> 0:09:52,016
when we check Differentiate

304
00:09:52,016 --> 0:09:52,526
Without Color.

305
00:09:54,216 --> 0:09:55,426
Thank you all so much for your

306
00:09:55,426 --> 0:09:55,656
time.
