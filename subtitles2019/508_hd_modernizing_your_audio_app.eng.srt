&gt;&gt; Hello, and welcome to our

3
00:00:09,036 --> 0:00:11,006
session about Modernizing Your

4
00:00:11,006 --> 0:00:11,496
Audio App.

5
00:00:12,336 --> 0:00:14,246
My name is Peter Vasil, and I'm

6
00:00:14,246 --> 0:00:15,886
a software engineer in the Core

7
00:00:15,886 --> 0:00:16,486
Audio Team.

8
00:00:16,776 --> 0:00:19,296
Let's start with audio units.

9
00:00:21,556 --> 0:00:22,276
Support for

10
00:00:22,276 --> 0:00:23,856
Carbon-Component-Based Audio

11
00:00:23,856 --> 0:00:25,736
Units will be removed in a

12
00:00:25,736 --> 0:00:27,166
future macOS release.

13
00:00:28,036 --> 0:00:29,926
We encourage hosts to use the

14
00:00:29,926 --> 0:00:31,826
AudioComponent API for audio

15
00:00:31,826 --> 0:00:32,866
unit discovery.

16
00:00:35,226 --> 0:00:36,936
With the next OS release,

17
00:00:37,136 --> 0:00:38,676
AudioHardwarePlugIn-based

18
00:00:38,676 --> 0:00:41,326
plugins are disabled by default.

19
00:00:42,176 --> 0:00:43,556
We recommend using the

20
00:00:43,556 --> 0:00:45,766
AudioServerPlugin API instead.

21
00:00:46,796 --> 0:00:48,676
For now, disabled plugins can be

22
00:00:48,676 --> 0:00:50,346
re-enabled in the Audio MIDI

23
00:00:50,346 --> 0:00:53,406
Setup utility, but support will

24
00:00:53,406 --> 0:00:54,766
be removed completely in a

25
00:00:54,766 --> 0:00:56,226
future macOS release.

26
00:00:56,716 --> 0:01:00,236
With the next OS release, we

27
00:00:56,716 --> 0:01:00,236
With the next OS release, we

28
00:01:00,236 --> 0:01:01,256
will introduce some

29
00:01:01,256 --> 0:01:02,136
deprecations.

30
00:01:02,686 --> 0:01:05,126
AUGraph, Inter-App Audio, and

31
00:01:05,126 --> 0:01:07,076
OpenAL will be deprecated.

32
00:01:07,766 --> 0:01:09,326
We encourage developers to

33
00:01:09,326 --> 0:01:11,746
switch over to AVAudioEngine, as

34
00:01:11,746 --> 0:01:13,586
replacement for AUGraph and

35
00:01:13,586 --> 0:01:14,376
OpenAL.

36
00:01:15,676 --> 0:01:17,566
For Inter-App Audio, please use

37
00:01:17,766 --> 0:01:19,646
Audio Unit Extensions instead.

38
00:01:20,816 --> 0:01:22,996
The 3D Mixer parameters have

39
00:01:23,026 --> 0:01:24,426
been unified across all

40
00:01:24,426 --> 0:01:25,206
platforms.

41
00:01:25,296 --> 0:01:27,946
For details, please refer to the

42
00:01:27,946 --> 0:01:30,166
AudioUnitParameters header file

43
00:01:30,366 --> 0:01:32,216
for a list of new and deprecated

44
00:01:32,216 --> 0:01:33,006
parameters.

45
00:01:33,956 --> 0:01:35,786
For more information, please

46
00:01:35,786 --> 0:01:37,426
visit the developer website.

47
00:01:39,306 --> 0:01:40,696
Thank you for your attention.
