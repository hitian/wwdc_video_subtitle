00:00:07,396 --> 0:00:09,166
&gt;&gt; Hi, this is Tom from the Car

3
00:00:09,166 --> 0:00:10,586
Experience Team at Apple and

4
00:00:10,586 --> 0:00:12,166
welcome to our talk on Advances

5
00:00:12,166 --> 0:00:13,246
in CarPlay Systems.

6
00:00:15,196 --> 0:00:16,656
As you know, CarPlay is the

7
00:00:16,656 --> 0:00:18,636
smarter, safer way to use your

8
00:00:18,636 --> 0:00:20,766
iPhone in the car.

9
00:00:20,766 --> 0:00:22,716
iOS 13 has a ton of new updates

10
00:00:22,716 --> 0:00:24,576
to CarPlay including the all-new

11
00:00:24,576 --> 0:00:26,326
CarPlay Dashboard for a simple

12
00:00:26,326 --> 0:00:28,746
view of your tunes, turns and

13
00:00:28,746 --> 0:00:30,186
Smart Siri suggestions.

14
00:00:30,506 --> 0:00:32,235
In this session we will

15
00:00:32,235 --> 0:00:33,436
introduce you to vehicle

16
00:00:33,436 --> 0:00:34,826
integration features newly

17
00:00:34,826 --> 0:00:36,546
available in iOS 13.

18
00:00:37,386 --> 0:00:38,746
All of the features we will talk

19
00:00:38,746 --> 0:00:40,096
about today will require the

20
00:00:40,096 --> 0:00:42,006
vehicle system to adopt new APIs

21
00:00:42,006 --> 0:00:43,456
available in the CarPlay

22
00:00:43,456 --> 0:00:47,506
Communication plug-in R15.

23
00:00:47,506 --> 0:00:48,926
Today we will introduce new

24
00:00:48,926 --> 0:00:50,696
display and audio features in

25
00:00:50,696 --> 0:00:51,856
CarPlay that you can take

26
00:00:51,856 --> 0:00:53,566
advantage of in future vehicles.

27
00:00:55,156 --> 0:00:56,956
First up, let's look at how

28
00:00:56,956 --> 0:00:58,406
CarPlay supports irregularly

29
00:00:58,406 --> 0:00:59,406
shaped displays.

30
00:01:00,726 --> 0:01:01,866
The vehicle declares the

31
00:01:01,866 --> 0:01:03,786
physical size and resolution of

32
00:01:03,786 --> 0:01:04,786
the display and iPhone will

33
00:01:04,786 --> 0:01:07,416
setup an H.264 video stream of

34
00:01:07,416 --> 0:01:08,836
that size which will be rendered

35
00:01:08,836 --> 0:01:09,456
to the display.

36
00:01:10,606 --> 0:01:12,606
Prior to iOS 13, the CarPlay UI

37
00:01:12,606 --> 0:01:14,566
would be drawn up to each edge

38
00:01:14,566 --> 0:01:15,526
of the video screen.

39
00:01:16,286 --> 0:01:18,426
However, some car displays are

40
00:01:18,426 --> 0:01:19,976
fitted with pieces of trim that

41
00:01:19,976 --> 0:01:21,636
may obscure parts of the CarPlay

42
00:01:21,636 --> 0:01:23,566
user interface, restricting

43
00:01:23,566 --> 0:01:24,776
access to some touchable

44
00:01:24,776 --> 0:01:26,506
controls and preventing the user

45
00:01:26,506 --> 0:01:27,926
from being able to see certain

46
00:01:27,926 --> 0:01:28,876
parts of the UI.

47
00:01:30,316 --> 0:01:32,296
With iOS 13, CarPlay now

48
00:01:32,296 --> 0:01:33,826
supports irregularly shaped

49
00:01:33,826 --> 0:01:34,496
displays.

50
00:01:35,136 --> 0:01:36,556
First, your system defines a

51
00:01:36,556 --> 0:01:37,186
view area.

52
00:01:37,456 --> 0:01:39,246
This represents the rectangle

53
00:01:39,246 --> 0:01:40,886
that CarPlay can draw a user

54
00:01:40,886 --> 0:01:42,156
interface image into.

55
00:01:43,586 --> 0:01:45,646
A view area can also contain a

56
00:01:45,646 --> 0:01:46,326
safe area.

57
00:01:47,386 --> 0:01:48,796
The safe area is also a

58
00:01:48,796 --> 0:01:50,626
rectangular area and must be a

59
00:01:50,626 --> 0:01:51,896
subset of the view area.

60
00:01:53,276 --> 0:01:55,006
The safe area represents the

61
00:01:55,006 --> 0:01:56,446
portion of the display that will

62
00:01:56,446 --> 0:01:58,076
contain interactive content.

63
00:01:58,676 --> 0:02:00,346
This includes user interface

64
00:01:58,676 --> 0:02:00,346
This includes user interface

65
00:02:00,346 --> 0:02:01,536
elements such as buttons and

66
00:02:01,536 --> 0:02:02,996
lists and important status

67
00:02:02,996 --> 0:02:05,136
information like time, signal

68
00:02:05,136 --> 0:02:06,546
strength and route guidance

69
00:02:06,546 --> 0:02:07,146
information.

70
00:02:07,736 --> 0:02:09,295
iPhone will draw interactive

71
00:02:09,295 --> 0:02:11,076
content within the boundaries of

72
00:02:11,076 --> 0:02:11,786
the safe area.

73
00:02:13,656 --> 0:02:15,036
Modern car displays can come in

74
00:02:15,036 --> 0:02:16,786
many different shapes and sizes.

75
00:02:16,786 --> 0:02:17,956
Displays themselves may be

76
00:02:17,956 --> 0:02:19,736
non-rectangular or portions of

77
00:02:19,736 --> 0:02:21,486
the display may be occluded by

78
00:02:21,486 --> 0:02:22,196
other elements.

79
00:02:22,926 --> 0:02:24,896
With iOS 13, CarPlay can use

80
00:02:24,896 --> 0:02:26,476
safe areas to better support

81
00:02:26,476 --> 0:02:28,296
non-rectangular shaped displays.

82
00:02:28,586 --> 0:02:30,976
First, the system defines a view

83
00:02:30,976 --> 0:02:31,316
area.

84
00:02:32,136 --> 0:02:33,516
The view area rectangle in this

85
00:02:33,516 --> 0:02:34,586
case would be made up of the

86
00:02:34,586 --> 0:02:36,216
widest and tallest points of the

87
00:02:36,216 --> 0:02:36,736
display.

88
00:02:37,226 --> 0:02:38,626
This allows the CarPlay image to

89
00:02:38,626 --> 0:02:40,016
render to all parts of the

90
00:02:40,016 --> 0:02:40,546
display.

91
00:02:41,626 --> 0:02:43,416
Then a safe area rectangle will

92
00:02:43,416 --> 0:02:44,756
be declared for the part of the

93
00:02:44,756 --> 0:02:46,756
display where a CarPlay UI is

94
00:02:46,756 --> 0:02:48,496
guaranteed to be visible and

95
00:02:48,496 --> 0:02:49,896
interactable to the user.

96
00:02:50,486 --> 0:02:52,926
And that was our update on

97
00:02:52,926 --> 0:02:54,566
irregularly shaped displays.

98
00:02:54,946 --> 0:02:58,276
Next up, let's talk about second

99
00:02:58,276 --> 0:02:59,606
screen support in CarPlay.

100
00:03:01,016 --> 0:03:02,866
Prior to iOS 13, iPhone provided

101
00:03:02,866 --> 0:03:05,586
a single H.264 video screen to

102
00:03:05,586 --> 0:03:07,126
display the CarPlay UI on the

103
00:03:07,126 --> 0:03:08,386
center console display.

104
00:03:09,246 --> 0:03:10,686
This provides a great way for

105
00:03:10,686 --> 0:03:12,096
users to set a navigation

106
00:03:12,096 --> 0:03:13,976
destination, interact with music

107
00:03:13,976 --> 0:03:15,006
apps and more.

108
00:03:15,216 --> 0:03:17,366
However, this limits the user's

109
00:03:17,366 --> 0:03:18,486
CarPlay experience to the

110
00:03:18,486 --> 0:03:19,676
vehicle's main display.

111
00:03:21,196 --> 0:03:23,136
Many vehicles have rich displays

112
00:03:23,136 --> 0:03:24,626
directly in front of the driver

113
00:03:24,626 --> 0:03:26,226
to show important information in

114
00:03:26,226 --> 0:03:27,216
the form of an instrument

115
00:03:27,216 --> 0:03:27,586
cluster.

116
00:03:28,346 --> 0:03:30,156
In iOS 13, we now support

117
00:03:30,156 --> 0:03:33,116
multiple H.264 video streams to

118
00:03:33,116 --> 0:03:34,636
display CarPlay content in the

119
00:03:34,636 --> 0:03:36,026
vehicle's instrument cluster.

120
00:03:36,306 --> 0:03:38,116
This is a great way to display

121
00:03:38,116 --> 0:03:39,176
additional information from

122
00:03:39,176 --> 0:03:40,946
CarPlay apps directly in the

123
00:03:40,946 --> 0:03:41,796
instrument cluster.

124
00:03:43,896 --> 0:03:45,006
And different types of

125
00:03:45,006 --> 0:03:46,216
information can be displayed in

126
00:03:46,216 --> 0:03:47,146
different areas of the

127
00:03:47,146 --> 0:03:48,866
instrument cluster using more

128
00:03:48,866 --> 0:03:49,876
than one video stream.

129
00:03:50,326 --> 0:03:53,806
In iOS 13, CarPlay will support

130
00:03:53,806 --> 0:03:55,276
a maneuver instruction card

131
00:03:55,276 --> 0:03:57,726
provided by Apple Maps, as well

132
00:03:57,726 --> 0:03:58,946
as a map view which can be

133
00:03:58,946 --> 0:04:00,386
rendered in parallel with the

134
00:03:58,946 --> 0:04:00,386
rendered in parallel with the

135
00:04:00,386 --> 0:04:02,066
instruction card in two separate

136
00:04:02,066 --> 0:04:03,016
video streams.

137
00:04:04,386 --> 0:04:05,756
Each video stream will have an

138
00:04:05,756 --> 0:04:07,576
independent night mode, allowing

139
00:04:07,576 --> 0:04:09,086
the vehicle system to specify an

140
00:04:09,086 --> 0:04:10,336
appearance mode for different

141
00:04:10,336 --> 0:04:11,266
content types.

142
00:04:12,186 --> 0:04:14,216
Also, the vehicle chooses what

143
00:04:14,216 --> 0:04:15,886
type of content is shown in each

144
00:04:15,886 --> 0:04:16,276
stream.

145
00:04:16,776 --> 0:04:18,116
For instrument clusters, car

146
00:04:18,116 --> 0:04:19,986
play will only draw the type of

147
00:04:19,986 --> 0:04:21,136
content the vehicle has

148
00:04:21,136 --> 0:04:21,636
selected.

149
00:04:21,956 --> 0:04:24,336
But please note for heads-up

150
00:04:24,336 --> 0:04:26,306
displays, information from iAP2

151
00:04:26,386 --> 0:04:27,906
Route Guidance will continue to

152
00:04:27,906 --> 0:04:28,466
be used.

153
00:04:28,936 --> 0:04:30,606
So with this in mind, let's look

154
00:04:30,606 --> 0:04:31,896
at how to best utilize the

155
00:04:31,896 --> 0:04:33,456
different available protocols to

156
00:04:33,456 --> 0:04:35,026
integrate CarPlay into a vehicle

157
00:04:35,026 --> 0:04:35,776
instrument cluster.

158
00:04:36,816 --> 0:04:38,116
Users can be provided with

159
00:04:38,116 --> 0:04:39,726
simple status information from

160
00:04:39,726 --> 0:04:41,126
apps in CarPlay such as

161
00:04:41,126 --> 0:04:43,026
navigation, audio and phone

162
00:04:43,026 --> 0:04:43,456
calls.

163
00:04:44,406 --> 0:04:46,396
Firstly, map or turn-by-turn

164
00:04:46,396 --> 0:04:47,956
information provided as a video

165
00:04:47,956 --> 0:04:49,426
from iPhone can be displayed.

166
00:04:50,496 --> 0:04:51,726
Additional information about the

167
00:04:51,726 --> 0:04:52,946
navigation route can also be

168
00:04:52,946 --> 0:04:55,126
provided as metadata using the

169
00:04:55,126 --> 0:04:56,986
iAP2 Route Guidance feature.

170
00:04:57,746 --> 0:05:00,266
This, like other iAP2 features,

171
00:04:57,746 --> 0:05:00,266
This, like other iAP2 features,

172
00:05:00,266 --> 0:05:01,706
requires the vehicle to draw the

173
00:05:01,706 --> 0:05:03,786
metadata in its own native UI.

174
00:05:04,056 --> 0:05:05,696
The currently playing track or

175
00:05:05,696 --> 0:05:07,396
podcasts can be rendered using

176
00:05:07,396 --> 0:05:09,596
iAP2 Now Playing along with any

177
00:05:09,596 --> 0:05:11,456
information about ongoing phone

178
00:05:11,456 --> 0:05:12,786
calls using the iAP2

179
00:05:12,786 --> 0:05:14,006
Communications feature.

180
00:05:15,036 --> 0:05:16,666
Control of those phone calls can

181
00:05:16,666 --> 0:05:18,686
be supported using iAP2 Call

182
00:05:18,686 --> 0:05:20,456
Controls, allowing the system to

183
00:05:20,456 --> 0:05:22,036
offer specific user actions

184
00:05:22,116 --> 0:05:23,726
during phone calls like mute,

185
00:05:24,436 --> 0:05:26,786
swap call and end call.

186
00:05:28,856 --> 0:05:30,536
Displaying CarPlay content in

187
00:05:30,536 --> 0:05:31,586
the instrument cluster is

188
00:05:31,586 --> 0:05:32,636
another part of the vehicle

189
00:05:32,636 --> 0:05:34,206
system that benefits from using

190
00:05:34,206 --> 0:05:35,936
safe areas and view areas.

191
00:05:36,586 --> 0:05:38,316
In this example, the view area

192
00:05:38,316 --> 0:05:39,986
would be the rectangle between

193
00:05:40,046 --> 0:05:41,376
and behind the virtual

194
00:05:41,376 --> 0:05:42,106
tachometers.

195
00:05:42,716 --> 0:05:43,976
While aesthetically it may be

196
00:05:43,976 --> 0:05:45,856
desirable for CarPlay content to

197
00:05:45,856 --> 0:05:47,296
fill this region, some of it

198
00:05:47,296 --> 0:05:48,696
would be obscured by the virtual

199
00:05:48,696 --> 0:05:49,396
tachometers.

200
00:05:49,776 --> 0:05:51,476
So a safe area would be declared

201
00:05:51,476 --> 0:05:52,866
in the area between the two

202
00:05:52,866 --> 0:05:54,466
tachometers and CarPlay will

203
00:05:54,466 --> 0:05:55,526
position the important

204
00:05:55,526 --> 0:05:56,736
information where it will be

205
00:05:56,736 --> 0:05:57,716
visible to the user.

206
00:05:58,286 --> 0:06:00,856
And multiple streams can be set

207
00:05:58,286 --> 0:06:00,856
And multiple streams can be set

208
00:06:00,856 --> 0:06:02,116
up to display different types of

209
00:06:02,116 --> 0:06:03,496
content from CarPlay within the

210
00:06:03,496 --> 0:06:04,296
instrument cluster.

211
00:06:04,526 --> 0:06:06,626
For example, the second stream

212
00:06:06,626 --> 0:06:07,806
could be a map view and the

213
00:06:07,806 --> 0:06:09,736
third stream an instruction

214
00:06:10,076 --> 0:06:10,606
card.

215
00:06:11,116 --> 0:06:12,216
Displaying content within a

216
00:06:12,216 --> 0:06:13,806
virtual tachometer will also

217
00:06:13,806 --> 0:06:15,706
make use of view areas and safe

218
00:06:15,706 --> 0:06:16,186
areas.

219
00:06:17,006 --> 0:06:18,196
The rectangle containing the

220
00:06:18,196 --> 0:06:20,046
entire circle would be the view

221
00:06:20,046 --> 0:06:21,666
area, and the rectangle

222
00:06:21,666 --> 0:06:23,246
contained entirely within the

223
00:06:23,246 --> 0:06:24,916
circle is the safe area.

224
00:06:25,736 --> 0:06:27,706
Again, CarPlay will position the

225
00:06:27,706 --> 0:06:29,286
important information where it

226
00:06:29,286 --> 0:06:30,476
will be visible to the user.

227
00:06:31,936 --> 0:06:33,206
So that was our update on

228
00:06:33,206 --> 0:06:34,666
support for second screens.

229
00:06:36,416 --> 0:06:37,446
Now let's take a look at the

230
00:06:37,446 --> 0:06:38,836
last of our new features that

231
00:06:38,836 --> 0:06:40,236
affects displays in CarPlay,

232
00:06:40,636 --> 0:06:42,316
dynamic screen resizing.

233
00:06:43,586 --> 0:06:45,606
Prior to iOS 13, the size of the

234
00:06:45,606 --> 0:06:47,336
CarPlay image remained fixed

235
00:06:47,336 --> 0:06:48,506
while the CarPlay session was

236
00:06:48,506 --> 0:06:48,906
active.

237
00:06:49,466 --> 0:06:51,606
Now the size of the CarPlay UI

238
00:06:51,606 --> 0:06:53,086
can change on the fly at the

239
00:06:53,086 --> 0:06:55,046
user's request by declaring

240
00:06:55,046 --> 0:06:56,406
multiple view areas for that

241
00:06:56,406 --> 0:06:56,866
display.

242
00:06:57,856 --> 0:06:59,226
This is ideal for systems that

243
00:06:59,226 --> 0:07:00,926
support configurable horizontal

244
00:06:59,226 --> 0:07:00,926
support configurable horizontal

245
00:07:00,926 --> 0:07:03,116
split screens as shown here, and

246
00:07:03,116 --> 0:07:04,616
larger portrait screens that are

247
00:07:04,616 --> 0:07:06,276
normally divided into distinct

248
00:07:06,276 --> 0:07:07,846
context-specific regions.

249
00:07:08,436 --> 0:07:10,016
CarPlay can provide an Always

250
00:07:10,016 --> 0:07:11,546
Available button for the user to

251
00:07:11,546 --> 0:07:13,176
trigger a resize request from

252
00:07:13,176 --> 0:07:14,476
within the CarPlay UI.

253
00:07:15,786 --> 0:07:17,376
This is useful to show CarPlay

254
00:07:17,376 --> 0:07:18,966
in a full-screen configuration

255
00:07:19,066 --> 0:07:20,416
without reserving space in the

256
00:07:20,416 --> 0:07:22,626
native UI for dedicated control

257
00:07:22,626 --> 0:07:23,816
for the user to exit that

258
00:07:23,816 --> 0:07:24,566
configuration.

259
00:07:26,676 --> 0:07:28,236
Resizing is not only supported

260
00:07:28,236 --> 0:07:29,626
on the center console display

261
00:07:29,796 --> 0:07:30,796
but also on the instrument

262
00:07:30,796 --> 0:07:31,486
cluster as well.

263
00:07:32,806 --> 0:07:34,076
So let's use the instrument

264
00:07:34,076 --> 0:07:35,176
cluster from the previous

265
00:07:35,176 --> 0:07:36,556
section as an example of how

266
00:07:36,556 --> 0:07:38,236
dynamic resizing could be used

267
00:07:38,236 --> 0:07:38,816
in CarPlay.

268
00:07:40,136 --> 0:07:41,436
Let's say this instrument

269
00:07:41,436 --> 0:07:43,076
cluster offers the user a way to

270
00:07:43,076 --> 0:07:44,616
move the virtual tachometers

271
00:07:44,876 --> 0:07:46,476
into one of two preferred

272
00:07:46,476 --> 0:07:47,156
positions.

273
00:07:48,626 --> 0:07:50,116
For this to work well, the

274
00:07:50,116 --> 0:07:51,406
CarPlay image needs to be able

275
00:07:51,406 --> 0:07:52,776
to adjust its size based on

276
00:07:52,776 --> 0:07:54,066
where the virtual tachometers

277
00:07:54,066 --> 0:07:54,746
are positioned.

278
00:07:56,036 --> 0:07:57,586
Multiple view areas can be

279
00:07:57,586 --> 0:07:59,016
declared for this display to

280
00:07:59,016 --> 0:07:59,706
make this happen.

281
00:08:00,486 --> 0:08:01,666
Let's declare the first view

282
00:08:01,666 --> 0:08:02,686
area for the widest

283
00:08:02,686 --> 0:08:04,426
configuration and include a safe

284
00:08:04,426 --> 0:08:05,786
area as discussed earlier.

285
00:08:08,056 --> 0:08:09,526
For the narrower configuration,

286
00:08:09,586 --> 0:08:11,236
a second view area would be used

287
00:08:11,236 --> 0:08:12,936
with its own narrower safe area.

288
00:08:14,036 --> 0:08:15,316
The vehicle system can also

289
00:08:15,316 --> 0:08:16,956
specify how long the transition

290
00:08:16,956 --> 0:08:18,246
between those configurations

291
00:08:18,246 --> 0:08:19,666
should take, allowing the

292
00:08:19,666 --> 0:08:21,236
CarPlay content to transition

293
00:08:21,236 --> 0:08:22,966
sizes in the same timeframe.

294
00:08:24,026 --> 0:08:25,026
Let's take a look at how this

295
00:08:25,026 --> 0:08:26,566
transition would work.

296
00:08:27,866 --> 0:08:29,486
The user starts in the wider

297
00:08:29,486 --> 0:08:30,956
configuration and uses some

298
00:08:30,956 --> 0:08:32,806
native UI control, possibly a

299
00:08:32,806 --> 0:08:34,056
steering wheel button, to begin

300
00:08:34,056 --> 0:08:34,746
the transition.

301
00:08:37,006 --> 0:08:37,976
During this three-second

302
00:08:37,976 --> 0:08:39,466
transition, CarPlay is telling

303
00:08:39,466 --> 0:08:40,826
the native system the size of

304
00:08:40,826 --> 0:08:42,645
the encoded image in the H.264

305
00:08:42,645 --> 0:08:44,196
frame, allowing the vehicle

306
00:08:44,196 --> 0:08:45,306
system to synchronize the

307
00:08:45,306 --> 0:08:46,656
position of its own tachometer

308
00:08:46,656 --> 0:08:47,626
UI elements.

309
00:08:48,166 --> 0:08:51,026
So in summary, dynamic resizing

310
00:08:51,026 --> 0:08:52,706
is supported on center console

311
00:08:52,706 --> 0:08:54,226
and instrument cluster displays.

312
00:08:54,866 --> 0:08:56,966
A UI resize can be triggered by

313
00:08:56,966 --> 0:08:58,316
the user either through the

314
00:08:58,316 --> 0:09:00,026
native UI or a button within the

315
00:08:58,316 --> 0:09:00,026
native UI or a button within the

316
00:09:00,026 --> 0:09:00,846
CarPlay UI.

317
00:09:02,316 --> 0:09:03,736
The vehicle system declares how

318
00:09:03,736 --> 0:09:05,116
long transitions between view

319
00:09:05,116 --> 0:09:05,886
areas should take.

320
00:09:06,276 --> 0:09:09,256
And CarPlay provides an update

321
00:09:09,256 --> 0:09:10,556
on how far the view area

322
00:09:10,556 --> 0:09:12,106
transition it is so the vehicle

323
00:09:12,106 --> 0:09:13,116
system can synchronize

324
00:09:13,116 --> 0:09:14,816
transition animations in its own

325
00:09:14,816 --> 0:09:15,156
UI.

326
00:09:15,516 --> 0:09:18,186
So that's all for our new

327
00:09:18,186 --> 0:09:19,716
display-related features.

328
00:09:20,036 --> 0:09:21,326
Thanks for listening so far.

329
00:09:21,706 --> 0:09:23,096
Now over to Tanya for an update

330
00:09:23,096 --> 0:09:24,216
on Siri in CarPlay.

331
00:09:25,606 --> 0:09:26,226
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Tom.

332
00:09:26,866 --> 0:09:28,656
My name is Tanya Kancheva and

333
00:09:28,656 --> 0:09:30,656
I'll talk to you about enabling

334
00:09:30,656 --> 0:09:32,396
Hey Siri support in future

335
00:09:32,396 --> 0:09:33,046
vehicles.

336
00:09:33,996 --> 0:09:35,756
So what do we mean when we talk

337
00:09:35,756 --> 0:09:37,476
about supporting Hey Siri in

338
00:09:37,476 --> 0:09:37,966
your car?

339
00:09:39,326 --> 0:09:41,696
First, of course, the driver can

340
00:09:41,696 --> 0:09:43,006
launch Siri completely

341
00:09:43,006 --> 0:09:44,996
hands-free without needing to

342
00:09:44,996 --> 0:09:46,886
press a button or take their

343
00:09:46,886 --> 0:09:47,896
eyes off the road.

344
00:09:48,956 --> 0:09:51,136
And since Hey Siri is detected

345
00:09:51,136 --> 0:09:52,646
using the car's microphone,

346
00:09:53,226 --> 0:09:55,436
iPhone can be out of sight, left

347
00:09:55,436 --> 0:09:57,086
in a pocket or even in the

348
00:09:57,086 --> 0:09:57,436
trunk.

349
00:09:58,156 --> 0:09:59,846
Siri will still be available.

350
00:10:01,796 --> 0:10:03,946
We also updated audio handling

351
00:10:04,016 --> 0:10:05,856
so that activating Siri through

352
00:10:05,856 --> 0:10:08,116
a button press is instantaneous.

353
00:10:08,856 --> 0:10:10,666
Just hold the Siri button on the

354
00:10:10,666 --> 0:10:12,426
steering wheel and say your

355
00:10:12,426 --> 0:10:14,056
request without waiting for an

356
00:10:14,056 --> 0:10:15,506
audible trigger to speak.

357
00:10:16,196 --> 0:10:17,636
Siri will be back with your

358
00:10:17,636 --> 0:10:18,906
answer immediately.

359
00:10:21,286 --> 0:10:23,566
Lastly, we looked at how Siri

360
00:10:23,566 --> 0:10:25,276
and Music interplay in the car

361
00:10:25,606 --> 0:10:27,496
and enable the smoother and more

362
00:10:27,496 --> 0:10:28,756
familiar experience.

363
00:10:29,546 --> 0:10:30,936
Music continues to play in the

364
00:10:30,936 --> 0:10:33,076
background while interacting

365
00:10:33,076 --> 0:10:33,626
with Siri.

366
00:10:37,246 --> 0:10:39,166
Here is a system overview for

367
00:10:39,166 --> 0:10:40,576
audio handling in CarPlay.

368
00:10:41,266 --> 0:10:42,826
Some of the components should

369
00:10:42,826 --> 0:10:44,516
already be familiar to you, but

370
00:10:44,746 --> 0:10:46,276
let's go ahead and look into the

371
00:10:46,276 --> 0:10:46,876
details.

372
00:10:48,216 --> 0:10:50,506
To support Hey Siri, the in-car

373
00:10:50,506 --> 0:10:52,386
microphone needs to be always

374
00:10:52,386 --> 0:10:55,336
active and undergo continuous

375
00:10:55,336 --> 0:10:56,256
voice processing.

376
00:10:57,616 --> 0:10:59,376
The echo cancellation module

377
00:10:59,376 --> 0:11:01,256
runs all the time and removes

378
00:10:59,376 --> 0:11:01,256
runs all the time and removes

379
00:11:01,256 --> 0:11:02,626
any audio playing through the

380
00:11:02,626 --> 0:11:04,916
car's speakers as well as

381
00:11:04,916 --> 0:11:06,386
reduces background driving

382
00:11:06,386 --> 0:11:06,656
noise.

383
00:11:08,846 --> 0:11:11,146
The process microphone data is

384
00:11:11,146 --> 0:11:12,826
sent to an audio ring buffer

385
00:11:13,126 --> 0:11:14,786
within the CarPlay communication

386
00:11:14,786 --> 0:11:16,886
plug-in which holds a couple of

387
00:11:16,886 --> 0:11:18,816
seconds of historical audio.

388
00:11:19,586 --> 0:11:21,296
This buffer is stored within the

389
00:11:21,296 --> 0:11:23,576
car until there is a trigger to

390
00:11:23,576 --> 0:11:25,796
send it to iPhone.

391
00:11:26,026 --> 0:11:27,256
So what is this trigger?

392
00:11:28,156 --> 0:11:30,126
In fact, there are two modules

393
00:11:30,126 --> 0:11:31,886
which can lead to audio exchange

394
00:11:31,886 --> 0:11:32,576
with iPhone.

395
00:11:33,366 --> 0:11:35,306
Both constantly analyze the

396
00:11:35,306 --> 0:11:36,716
process microphone data.

397
00:11:37,536 --> 0:11:39,116
One can trigger when the drive

398
00:11:39,116 --> 0:11:40,126
says Siri.

399
00:11:40,346 --> 0:11:41,936
That's the keyword detector.

400
00:11:42,556 --> 0:11:44,456
The other one triggers when the

401
00:11:44,456 --> 0:11:45,836
drive starts talking.

402
00:11:46,276 --> 0:11:47,556
That's the voice activity

403
00:11:47,556 --> 0:11:48,016
detector.

404
00:11:49,056 --> 0:11:51,196
Both detectors must be available

405
00:11:51,196 --> 0:11:53,646
in the car as iPhone determines

406
00:11:53,846 --> 0:11:55,126
which one is used for a

407
00:11:55,126 --> 0:11:56,306
particular scenario.

408
00:11:58,096 --> 0:11:59,956
Now let's say the keyword

409
00:11:59,956 --> 0:12:02,216
detector triggered so the car

410
00:11:59,956 --> 0:12:02,216
detector triggered so the car

411
00:12:02,216 --> 0:12:03,936
notifies iPhone through the

412
00:12:03,936 --> 0:12:05,066
communication plug-in.

413
00:12:06,706 --> 0:12:09,176
iPhone opens a new audio stream

414
00:12:09,436 --> 0:12:11,946
called Aux In, requesting some

415
00:12:11,946 --> 0:12:13,756
historical audio data to be

416
00:12:13,756 --> 0:12:14,186
sent.

417
00:12:15,346 --> 0:12:18,366
The received audio is reanalyzed

418
00:12:18,706 --> 0:12:20,886
by a voice trigger detector on

419
00:12:21,006 --> 0:12:23,246
iPhone which verifies that the

420
00:12:23,246 --> 0:12:24,706
user said, "Hey, Siri."

421
00:12:25,666 --> 0:12:28,026
The second pass detector uses

422
00:12:28,026 --> 0:12:29,916
offline keyword detection on

423
00:12:29,916 --> 0:12:32,706
iPhone similar to how Hey Siri

424
00:12:32,706 --> 0:12:34,606
is detected when the user is not

425
00:12:34,606 --> 0:12:35,056
driving.

426
00:12:36,336 --> 0:12:38,196
Only after the second pass

427
00:12:38,196 --> 0:12:41,736
detector on iPhone triggers Siri

428
00:12:41,736 --> 0:12:43,686
is activated to process the data

429
00:12:44,016 --> 0:12:45,316
and respond to the user.

430
00:12:47,986 --> 0:12:49,716
Now, let's look at how this

431
00:12:49,716 --> 0:12:51,516
architecture is helping us

432
00:12:51,516 --> 0:12:53,376
improve triggering Siri with a

433
00:12:53,376 --> 0:12:54,246
button press.

434
00:12:54,636 --> 0:12:57,926
As we already saw, the mic, the

435
00:12:57,926 --> 0:13:00,276
ECNR unit and the audio ring

436
00:12:57,926 --> 0:13:00,276
ECNR unit and the audio ring

437
00:13:00,276 --> 0:13:02,136
buffer are processing audio

438
00:13:02,136 --> 0:13:04,026
within the car system all the

439
00:13:04,026 --> 0:13:04,436
time.

440
00:13:07,216 --> 0:13:08,686
Now the user presses the Siri

441
00:13:08,686 --> 0:13:10,326
button on the steering wheel

442
00:13:10,836 --> 0:13:13,416
that is the trigger for iPhone

443
00:13:13,416 --> 0:13:15,336
to request audio data from the

444
00:13:15,336 --> 0:13:17,176
time when the user pressed the

445
00:13:17,176 --> 0:13:17,646
button.

446
00:13:18,516 --> 0:13:20,076
Since this is the button press,

447
00:13:20,506 --> 0:13:22,446
Siri activates immediately.

448
00:13:22,946 --> 0:13:24,956
And as the buffered audio is

449
00:13:24,956 --> 0:13:27,566
sent faster than real-time, Siri

450
00:13:27,566 --> 0:13:29,366
can be ready with a response

451
00:13:29,366 --> 0:13:31,056
right after the user stops

452
00:13:31,056 --> 0:13:31,546
talking.

453
00:13:33,326 --> 0:13:35,886
Okay, now that we have discussed

454
00:13:35,886 --> 0:13:37,756
the three ways in which Siri can

455
00:13:37,756 --> 0:13:40,536
trigger from the car through a

456
00:13:40,536 --> 0:13:43,156
detected keyword, voice activity

457
00:13:43,426 --> 0:13:45,596
or a button press, let's see

458
00:13:45,596 --> 0:13:47,506
what happens when Siri is active

459
00:13:47,666 --> 0:13:48,896
and helping the driver.

460
00:13:50,466 --> 0:13:52,936
Typically, music will be playing

461
00:13:52,936 --> 0:13:53,496
in the car.

462
00:13:54,316 --> 0:13:56,136
In this case, let's say that

463
00:13:56,136 --> 0:13:57,846
music is coming from iPhone.

464
00:13:58,696 --> 0:14:00,366
The car will receive the audio,

465
00:13:58,696 --> 0:14:00,366
The car will receive the audio,

466
00:14:00,586 --> 0:14:02,366
mix it and play it through the

467
00:14:02,366 --> 0:14:03,016
speakers.

468
00:14:03,616 --> 0:14:05,696
In the past, when Siri started

469
00:14:05,696 --> 0:14:08,126
in CarPlay, music had to stop

470
00:14:08,296 --> 0:14:09,836
and there was a bit of silence

471
00:14:09,836 --> 0:14:11,486
before Siri prompts played.

472
00:14:12,636 --> 0:14:13,956
With this new architecture,

473
00:14:14,366 --> 0:14:16,536
media playback is separated from

474
00:14:16,536 --> 0:14:19,396
Siri prompts so the music can

475
00:14:19,396 --> 0:14:20,776
keep playing in the background.

476
00:14:21,966 --> 0:14:23,706
When Siri launches, an

477
00:14:23,706 --> 0:14:25,116
additional audio stream

478
00:14:25,116 --> 0:14:27,556
dedicated to Siri output, Aux

479
00:14:27,556 --> 0:14:29,296
Out, will be opened.

480
00:14:30,106 --> 0:14:32,636
The car will then mix the two

481
00:14:32,636 --> 0:14:35,036
streams, reduce the volume of

482
00:14:35,036 --> 0:14:37,366
the music as needed and play

483
00:14:37,366 --> 0:14:39,496
Siri prompts quickly and without

484
00:14:39,496 --> 0:14:40,586
big interruptions.

485
00:14:42,506 --> 0:14:44,536
But please don't forget that in

486
00:14:44,536 --> 0:14:47,016
addition to Siri prompts, there

487
00:14:47,016 --> 0:14:49,276
might be active route guidance,

488
00:14:49,646 --> 0:14:51,556
so the mixer has to be able to

489
00:14:51,556 --> 0:14:53,816
mix three parallel audio streams

490
00:14:53,816 --> 0:14:54,866
coming from iPhone.

491
00:14:57,066 --> 0:14:57,676
All right.

492
00:14:58,226 --> 0:14:59,626
Now that we have gone through

493
00:14:59,626 --> 0:15:00,936
the details of the audio

494
00:14:59,626 --> 0:15:00,936
the details of the audio

495
00:15:00,936 --> 0:15:02,926
architecture, let's quickly

496
00:15:02,926 --> 0:15:05,656
summarize what is needed within

497
00:15:05,656 --> 0:15:06,716
the vehicle system.

498
00:15:07,806 --> 0:15:10,046
First, a microphone which is

499
00:15:10,046 --> 0:15:11,766
always processing audio in your

500
00:15:11,766 --> 0:15:12,256
system.

501
00:15:13,606 --> 0:15:15,186
Then, an echo canceller and

502
00:15:15,216 --> 0:15:17,136
noise reduction module to clean

503
00:15:17,136 --> 0:15:18,396
up microphone input.

504
00:15:18,966 --> 0:15:21,786
A detector that triggers when

505
00:15:21,786 --> 0:15:23,006
the driver is talking.

506
00:15:23,576 --> 0:15:26,676
A detector that triggers when

507
00:15:26,676 --> 0:15:28,296
the Siri keyword is heard.

508
00:15:30,546 --> 0:15:32,906
The ability to mix three audio

509
00:15:32,906 --> 0:15:33,946
streams from CarPlay.

510
00:15:36,716 --> 0:15:38,396
And that's how our update on Hey

511
00:15:38,396 --> 0:15:38,816
Siri.

512
00:15:40,516 --> 0:15:41,926
Thank you for your time.

513
00:15:42,616 --> 0:15:44,376
