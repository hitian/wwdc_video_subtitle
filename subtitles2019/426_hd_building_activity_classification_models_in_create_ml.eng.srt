00:00:12,076 --> 0:00:15,196
&gt;&gt; I am Yuxin from Core ML.

3
00:00:15,566 --> 0:00:18,176
Today I'm very excited to

4
00:00:18,176 --> 0:00:20,476
introduce a brand-new model in

5
00:00:20,476 --> 0:00:22,996
Create ML this year, Activity

6
00:00:22,996 --> 0:00:23,856
Classification.

7
00:00:27,596 --> 0:00:30,966
We do lots of activities with

8
00:00:30,966 --> 0:00:34,226
our devices every day such as

9
00:00:34,496 --> 0:00:36,836
playing games, doing sports.

10
00:00:37,626 --> 0:00:39,856
And our mobile devices have been

11
00:00:40,106 --> 0:00:42,156
equipped with a very

12
00:00:42,286 --> 0:00:43,246
rich set of sensors.

13
00:00:44,366 --> 0:00:45,606
Such as for motion,

14
00:00:47,166 --> 0:00:49,916
Accelerometer and Gyroscope are

15
00:00:49,916 --> 0:00:51,056
very commonly used.

16
00:00:52,026 --> 0:00:54,146
And they can help us to detect

17
00:00:54,496 --> 0:00:56,146
your device's three-dimensional

18
00:00:56,196 --> 0:00:59,456
acceleration, rotation rate or

19
00:00:59,456 --> 0:01:00,516
device orientation.

20
00:00:59,456 --> 0:01:00,516
device orientation.

21
00:01:01,796 --> 0:01:05,706
And we could just use such sensor data 

22
00:01:05,706 --> 0:01:06,346
to represent our activities.

23
00:01:08,166 --> 0:01:11,146
For example, if you are jogging,

24
00:01:12,066 --> 0:01:14,196
your activity data may look very

25
00:01:14,196 --> 0:01:16,456
different when you are standing

26
00:01:16,776 --> 0:01:16,906
still.

27
00:01:18,276 --> 0:01:21,556
Similarly, if you have different

28
00:01:21,636 --> 0:01:24,886
gestures, gaming controls, or

29
00:01:24,886 --> 0:01:26,296
different sports movement.

30
00:01:26,366 --> 0:01:29,866
Your activity data could also be

31
00:01:29,866 --> 0:01:32,266
distinctive enough to be

32
00:01:32,356 --> 0:01:32,646
recognized.

33
00:01:34,546 --> 0:01:36,856
So what is Activity

34
00:01:36,856 --> 0:01:38,436
Classification?

35
00:01:39,306 --> 0:01:43,096
It is a task that allows you to

36
00:01:43,096 --> 0:01:45,706
recognize your pre-defined set

37
00:01:45,706 --> 0:01:49,026
of physical actions that you do

38
00:01:49,026 --> 0:01:50,586
with your devices.

39
00:01:51,416 --> 0:01:53,606
Then what if you have a

40
00:01:53,676 --> 0:01:55,746
different set of activities to

41
00:01:55,746 --> 0:02:00,006
recognize or your app may have a

42
00:01:55,746 --> 0:02:00,006
recognize or your app may have a

43
00:02:00,006 --> 0:02:00,706
different need.

44
00:02:00,706 --> 0:02:04,896
We think it will be really great

45
00:02:05,036 --> 0:02:07,086
if you could customize your own

46
00:02:07,086 --> 0:02:09,526
model for your own purpose and

47
00:02:10,735 --> 0:02:13,396
that's exactly what we are

48
00:02:13,436 --> 0:02:15,966
introducing this year, Activity

49
00:02:15,966 --> 0:02:19,506
Classification in Create ML.

50
00:02:19,726 --> 0:02:21,146
Perhaps, let's start with an

51
00:02:21,146 --> 0:02:22,126
example.

52
00:02:25,436 --> 0:02:28,426
I really love to go out and play

53
00:02:28,536 --> 0:02:30,696
ultimate frisbee with my family

54
00:02:30,816 --> 0:02:31,436
and friends.

55
00:02:32,716 --> 0:02:36,056
So after a whole game, I'm also

56
00:02:36,056 --> 0:02:38,916
very interested to see how well

57
00:02:38,916 --> 0:02:41,486
I might have performed such as

58
00:02:41,956 --> 0:02:43,646
what they types of throwing

59
00:02:43,646 --> 0:02:46,596
techniques and how many of them.

60
00:02:47,076 --> 0:02:49,106
So I trained a Frisbee Motion

61
00:02:49,106 --> 0:02:51,426
Classifier to recognize my moves

62
00:02:52,206 --> 0:02:54,026
and I use it on my watch.

63
00:02:54,636 --> 0:02:56,886
I think it's going to be fine.

64
00:02:57,246 --> 0:02:58,656
Let's see a live demo first.

65
00:03:00,386 --> 0:03:02,856
So this is the screen of my

66
00:03:02,976 --> 0:03:06,356
phone which is paired with my

67
00:03:06,356 --> 0:03:06,786
watch.

68
00:03:07,816 --> 0:03:09,796
So my model is going to run on

69
00:03:09,796 --> 0:03:10,396
my watch.

70
00:03:11,926 --> 0:03:14,396
You can see a Start button here.

71
00:03:15,886 --> 0:03:18,076
So once I hit a Start button, my

72
00:03:18,076 --> 0:03:19,486
watch is going to start

73
00:03:19,826 --> 0:03:21,076
streaming the sensor data.

74
00:03:22,116 --> 0:03:23,846
And then my model is going to

75
00:03:23,846 --> 0:03:25,676
make continuous predictions.

76
00:03:27,236 --> 0:03:30,516
So let's get started.

77
00:03:30,636 --> 0:03:32,826
Now it asks me to try a frisbee

78
00:03:32,826 --> 0:03:36,336
move which means it predicts a

79
00:03:36,336 --> 0:03:39,306
no activity class which is true

80
00:03:39,306 --> 0:03:39,806
for now.

81
00:03:40,476 --> 0:03:43,066
Let me try something simple

82
00:03:43,776 --> 0:03:43,906
first.

83
00:03:46,786 --> 0:03:48,696

91
00:04:10,526 --> 0:04:13,476
I also have a fancier and secret

00:04:13,476 --> 0:04:15,296
one to show.

93
00:04:15,526 --> 0:04:15,956
Bowling.

[ Applause ]

95
00:04:18,505 --> 0:04:20,946
It's called Bowler but as if I'm

96
00:04:20,946 --> 0:04:21,805
playing bowling.

97
00:04:21,805 --> 0:04:23,976
Let me try that again.

98
00:04:24,056 --> 0:04:24,846
Bowler.

99
00:04:28,936 --> 0:04:30,696
Yeah, it's machine learning models.

100
00:04:31,776 --> 0:04:36,746
Now, let me hit the Stop button

101
00:04:36,746 --> 0:04:40,516
and see my results.

102
00:04:41,726 --> 0:04:44,466
Looks like pretty okay to me.

103
00:04:45,586 --> 0:04:48,496
For certain classes like Bowler,

104
00:04:48,496 --> 0:04:50,796
I know I can always go back and

105
00:04:50,796 --> 0:04:51,626
collect more data.

106
00:04:52,546 --> 0:04:54,176
So I'm pretty fine with this.

107
00:04:54,526 --> 0:04:58,396
Very good exercise for today.

108
00:04:58,576 --> 0:05:04,056
Now, let's come back and I know

109
00:04:58,576 --> 0:05:04,056
Now, let's come back and I know

110
00:05:04,306 --> 0:05:07,896
you as developers may have lots

111
00:05:07,896 --> 0:05:10,576
of other more creative ideas to

112
00:05:10,576 --> 0:05:10,916
explore.

113
00:05:13,526 --> 0:05:17,156
So now let's see how could we

114
00:05:17,156 --> 0:05:19,476
truly set your model in Create

115
00:05:19,476 --> 0:05:19,656
ML.

116
00:05:23,056 --> 0:05:26,856
Just the three steps.

117
00:05:26,856 --> 0:05:28,546
First, collect some data for

118
00:05:28,546 --> 0:05:29,536
your own activities.

119
00:05:30,046 --> 0:05:35,306
Train the model using Create ML.

120
00:05:35,556 --> 0:05:38,736
And finally, deploy the model to

121
00:05:38,736 --> 0:05:39,926
your app.

122
00:05:41,516 --> 0:05:44,086
Let's get some data first.

123
00:05:46,396 --> 0:05:48,756
The easiest way to access sensor

124
00:05:48,756 --> 0:05:51,066
data is to use Core Motion.

125
00:05:52,526 --> 0:05:54,586
For more information, please

126
00:05:54,586 --> 0:05:56,836
refer to our previous sessions

127
00:05:57,106 --> 0:05:59,026
as well as Apple Developers

128
00:05:59,026 --> 0:06:00,056
Documentation.

Documentation.

130
00:06:00,566 --> 0:06:04,216
But from a high-level point of

131
00:06:04,666 --> 0:06:06,586
view your app could simply

132
00:06:06,586 --> 0:06:08,686
access a list of the sensors.

133
00:06:09,036 --> 0:06:10,426
So Core Motion Framework.

134
00:06:10,836 --> 0:06:13,736
You can also manipulate the

135
00:06:13,736 --> 0:06:17,106
Start, Stop, or Set Update

136
00:06:17,106 --> 0:06:19,506
Intervals from your app for your

137
00:06:19,506 --> 0:06:20,056
recordings.

138
00:06:20,396 --> 0:06:24,186
And you can also use exactly the

139
00:06:24,266 --> 0:06:26,546
same mechanism for both your

140
00:06:26,546 --> 0:06:28,666
training data collection as well

141
00:06:28,666 --> 0:06:31,786
as your later on device

142
00:06:32,251 --> 0:06:34,251
inference.

143
00:06:34,716 --> 0:06:37,096
And here is how my data look

144
00:06:37,096 --> 0:06:37,346
like.

145
00:06:38,356 --> 0:06:40,086
This is one of my Forehand

146
00:06:40,086 --> 0:06:43,876
recordings, which is in a CSV

147
00:06:43,876 --> 0:06:44,136
format.

148
00:06:45,716 --> 0:06:47,696
There's one column of Time

149
00:06:47,696 --> 0:06:51,026
Stamps and several other columns

150
00:06:51,026 --> 0:06:52,996
of the sensor features.

151
00:06:54,306 --> 0:06:56,446
I actually used both User

152
00:06:56,446 --> 0:06:58,676
Acceleration and Rotation Grade

153
00:06:58,936 --> 0:07:00,796
for my frisbee motion example.

154
00:06:58,936 --> 0:07:00,796
for my frisbee motion example.

155
00:07:01,346 --> 0:07:03,386
But here for simplicity only

156
00:07:03,386 --> 0:07:04,946
three are listed.

157
00:07:06,686 --> 0:07:08,826
And if they would like to take

158
00:07:08,826 --> 0:07:10,886
one step further to look into

159
00:07:10,886 --> 0:07:12,686
the data, this is how the

160
00:07:12,686 --> 0:07:15,326
activity patterns may look like.

161
00:07:16,416 --> 0:07:20,046
My Forehand recording has three

162
00:07:20,046 --> 0:07:22,056
back to back moves in the same

163
00:07:22,056 --> 0:07:22,406
class.

164
00:07:24,346 --> 0:07:27,346
And later during training, the

165
00:07:27,346 --> 0:07:29,046
deep learning model is going to

166
00:07:29,046 --> 0:07:31,576
use a sliding window to move

167
00:07:31,616 --> 0:07:33,496
through this time series data.

168
00:07:34,656 --> 0:07:36,366
And in this way, it could

169
00:07:36,366 --> 0:07:39,526
extract both your spatial and

170
00:07:39,526 --> 0:07:40,946
temporal patterns of the

171
00:07:40,946 --> 0:07:41,646
activities.

172
00:07:43,696 --> 0:07:45,586
Now we have the files ready.

173
00:07:46,376 --> 0:07:48,006
You could simply organize your

174
00:07:48,006 --> 0:07:50,526
data in such a hierarchy of data

175
00:07:50,596 --> 0:07:53,626
source, where each folder's name

176
00:07:53,626 --> 0:07:54,566
is a Label name.

177
00:07:54,566 --> 0:07:57,396
And all the files under this

178
00:07:57,396 --> 0:07:59,186
folder belongs to the same

179
00:07:59,186 --> 0:07:59,836
activity.

180
00:08:00,896 --> 0:08:03,346
We support CSV,JSON , and

181
00:08:03,866 --> 0:08:04,776
text formats.

182
00:08:05,736 --> 0:08:07,116
You could choose either one of

183
00:08:07,196 --> 0:08:10,376
them or if you like, you can mix

184
00:08:10,376 --> 0:08:11,646
and match.

185
00:08:13,736 --> 0:08:15,136
There's a data ready.

186
00:08:15,946 --> 0:08:20,506
Now let's start printing.

187
00:08:20,566 --> 0:08:22,706
Simply select Activity Class

188
00:08:22,706 --> 0:08:24,216
from our template from the

189
00:08:24,216 --> 0:08:27,566
Create ML app.

190
00:08:27,776 --> 0:08:30,016
And now this is a standard info

191
00:08:30,016 --> 0:08:33,265
screen where you could drag and

192
00:08:33,265 --> 0:08:35,946
drop your training data into the

193
00:08:35,946 --> 0:08:36,576
window.

194
00:08:37,356 --> 0:08:39,076
For Activity, you can see a

195
00:08:39,126 --> 0:08:41,866
preview of how many files and

196
00:08:41,936 --> 0:08:43,265
how many samples in your

197
00:08:43,265 --> 0:08:43,946
recordings.

198
00:08:45,516 --> 0:08:47,646
The one special step above the

199
00:08:47,726 --> 0:08:50,326
Activity is that you have to

200
00:08:50,326 --> 0:08:52,436
tell Create ML what are the

201
00:08:52,526 --> 0:08:54,106
sensor features you'd like to

202
00:08:54,106 --> 0:08:54,506
try out.

203
00:08:55,926 --> 0:08:58,736
Simply select one or a few from

204
00:08:58,736 --> 0:08:59,276
this list.

205
00:09:00,746 --> 0:09:02,366
And all these sensor features

206
00:09:02,856 --> 0:09:04,666
actually come from your own

207
00:09:04,666 --> 0:09:07,706
files, the headers of your CSV

208
00:09:08,516 --> 0:09:08,666
files.

209
00:09:11,626 --> 0:09:14,236
Optionally, you could choose to

210
00:09:14,236 --> 0:09:15,796
adjust the parameters as well

211
00:09:16,736 --> 0:09:18,756
such as this Prediction Window

212
00:09:18,816 --> 0:09:22,266
Size based on how fast and slow

213
00:09:22,266 --> 0:09:23,166
of your activities.

214
00:09:23,806 --> 0:09:27,116
For my frisbee motion example, I

215
00:09:27,236 --> 0:09:28,706
actually used the two second

216
00:09:28,786 --> 0:09:31,096
window, which is 100 samples.

217
00:09:31,096 --> 0:09:34,896
So I put 100 here and that's

218
00:09:34,896 --> 0:09:37,126
because my data was initially

219
00:09:37,126 --> 0:09:39,616
sampled at a 50 hertz frequency.

220
00:09:42,516 --> 0:09:44,756
Now, let's hit the Train button

221
00:09:44,756 --> 0:09:48,526
and we can start training from

222
00:09:48,576 --> 0:09:49,066
here.

223
00:09:49,526 --> 0:09:52,146
I'm sure you have seen this

224
00:09:52,146 --> 0:09:53,856
whole process several times

225
00:09:53,916 --> 0:09:54,596
during the week.

226
00:09:54,856 --> 0:09:57,256
I'm going to skip this because

227
00:09:57,516 --> 0:09:59,576
the whole workflow from here is

228
00:09:59,576 --> 0:10:01,716
exactly the same as other models

229
00:09:59,576 --> 0:10:01,716
exactly the same as other models

230
00:10:01,896 --> 0:10:03,216
in Create ML.

231
00:10:06,366 --> 0:10:07,896
If you are satisfied with your

232
00:10:07,896 --> 0:10:10,406
accuracies, you could move on

233
00:10:10,586 --> 0:10:13,056
and try some new data to

234
00:10:13,056 --> 0:10:14,996
evaluate the performance of this

235
00:10:14,996 --> 0:10:15,446
model.

236
00:10:19,046 --> 0:10:21,646
This is a standard testing tab.

237
00:10:22,296 --> 0:10:24,426
Just supply your testing data

238
00:10:24,576 --> 0:10:26,276
the same way you just did.

239
00:10:29,906 --> 0:10:32,506
And after the evaluation, you

240
00:10:32,506 --> 0:10:34,666
would see a table of your per

241
00:10:34,666 --> 0:10:37,876
class matrix in terms of

242
00:10:37,876 --> 0:10:39,396
precision and recall.

243
00:10:42,236 --> 0:10:44,306
For my frisbee motion example,

244
00:10:44,516 --> 0:10:47,336
you can see here, Bowler and

245
00:10:47,466 --> 0:10:49,416
Hammer, these certain classes

246
00:10:49,416 --> 0:10:50,496
are not that perfect.

247
00:10:51,666 --> 0:10:53,206
So this perhaps means I need to

248
00:10:53,206 --> 0:10:55,026
go back and collect more data

249
00:10:55,026 --> 0:10:55,986
for these classes.

250
00:10:55,986 --> 0:10:58,976
And iterate again, so we

251
00:10:58,976 --> 0:11:01,086
can improve the performance.

252
00:10:58,976 --> 0:11:01,086
can improve the performance.

253
00:11:03,196 --> 0:11:05,556
And finally, we get a train

254
00:11:05,556 --> 0:11:08,676
model and from this point, you

255
00:11:08,676 --> 0:11:10,596
could choose either save the

256
00:11:10,596 --> 0:11:12,846
model and deploy it to our app

257
00:11:13,926 --> 0:11:16,276
or you can do batch predictions

258
00:11:16,616 --> 0:11:19,706
in Create ML app on your Mac

259
00:11:19,706 --> 0:11:20,736
directly here.

260
00:11:22,596 --> 0:11:24,296
Simply add some new unseen

261
00:11:24,586 --> 0:11:27,256
and unlabeled the data into the

262
00:11:27,256 --> 0:11:30,746
window and you will see

263
00:11:30,886 --> 0:11:33,356
immediate prediction results in

264
00:11:33,356 --> 0:11:36,256
terms of Label Name, Confidence,

265
00:11:36,896 --> 0:11:38,806
and also a preview of your

266
00:11:38,806 --> 0:11:40,966
Activity Data so you could have

267
00:11:40,966 --> 0:11:42,366
a better understanding of your

268
00:11:42,366 --> 0:11:43,766
activities.

269
00:11:46,106 --> 0:11:48,906
And finally, this is my Core ML model.

270
00:11:50,316 --> 0:11:53,856
My Frisbee Motion Example is

271
00:11:54,096 --> 0:11:55,866
a Neural Network classifier.

272
00:11:56,396 --> 0:11:59,496
With only 1.1 megabyte which is

273
00:11:59,496 --> 0:12:01,906
pretty small and very simple for

274
00:11:59,496 --> 0:12:01,906
pretty small and very simple for

275
00:12:01,906 --> 0:12:03,466
mobile devices.

276
00:12:06,306 --> 0:12:09,246
In addition, you could also see

277
00:12:09,446 --> 0:12:11,766
a complete list of all the

278
00:12:11,766 --> 0:12:13,936
sensor features you have used in

279
00:12:13,936 --> 0:12:16,596
training, as well as a

280
00:12:16,596 --> 0:12:17,836
Prediction Window size.

281
00:12:18,506 --> 0:12:21,156
So later for your own device

282
00:12:21,156 --> 0:12:23,386
inference, you could simply use

283
00:12:23,386 --> 0:12:26,036
the same data, same size to keep

284
00:12:26,036 --> 0:12:27,386
consistent.

285
00:12:29,546 --> 0:12:31,896
And this is Create ML app.

286
00:12:32,446 --> 0:12:34,206
We also have the framework in macOS.

287
00:12:35,546 --> 0:12:37,516
So you could automate this whole

288
00:12:37,516 --> 0:12:40,056
process by using Xcode

289
00:12:40,056 --> 0:12:44,256
Playground, Swift Script, or

290
00:12:44,756 --> 0:12:46,916
Command Line Tools.

291
00:12:47,416 --> 0:12:48,036
Like this.

292
00:12:51,196 --> 0:12:53,156
The one special step above

293
00:12:53,156 --> 0:12:56,046
Activity is that you have to

294
00:12:56,046 --> 0:12:57,996
specify the selectedSensors.

295
00:12:59,136 --> 0:13:01,356
And other than this, the rest of

296
00:12:59,136 --> 0:13:01,356
And other than this, the rest of

297
00:13:01,426 --> 0:13:03,616
the workflow is standard and is

298
00:13:03,726 --> 0:13:05,706
the same with other models we

299
00:13:06,776 --> 0:13:06,896
have,

300
00:13:07,246 --> 0:13:09,806
where each training evaluation

301
00:13:09,806 --> 0:13:12,196
and model saving is just a one

302
00:13:12,196 --> 0:13:13,656
line of code for each.

303
00:13:17,526 --> 0:13:19,476
And this is how we view an

304
00:13:19,476 --> 0:13:21,456
activity classifier in Create

305
00:13:22,176 --> 0:13:22,246
ML.

306
00:13:23,416 --> 0:13:25,676
But additionally, I'd also love

307
00:13:25,676 --> 0:13:27,656
to share a few better practices

308
00:13:27,756 --> 0:13:28,486
for this model.

309
00:13:32,436 --> 0:13:34,316
Understand your activities.

310
00:13:35,486 --> 0:13:38,086
Use the relevant sensors, such

311
00:13:38,086 --> 0:13:40,666
as Accelerometer and Gyroscope,

312
00:13:40,666 --> 0:13:42,906
are very common for motion-based

313
00:13:43,896 --> 0:13:44,046
tasks.

314
00:13:46,526 --> 0:13:49,206
It will be also helpful to

315
00:13:49,206 --> 0:13:51,526
collect some data for additional

316
00:13:51,876 --> 0:13:54,206
no activity or other class.

317
00:13:55,276 --> 0:13:57,466
This is especially helpful for

318
00:13:57,466 --> 0:13:59,046
your runtime performance.

319
00:14:03,016 --> 0:14:05,546
Providing balanced classes is

320
00:14:05,546 --> 0:14:06,816
also good practice.

321
00:14:07,626 --> 0:14:09,886
For activity, this is in terms

322
00:14:09,886 --> 0:14:11,866
of both number of recording files and the

323
00:14:11,866 --> 0:14:14,986
recording length for each class.

324
00:14:16,036 --> 0:14:21,196
And finally, Core Motion

325
00:14:21,396 --> 0:14:23,446
provides both raw sensor data

326
00:14:23,446 --> 0:14:25,876
and processed device motion

327
00:14:25,876 --> 0:14:26,096
data.

328
00:14:27,566 --> 0:14:29,926
Device motion is a sensor fusion

329
00:14:29,926 --> 0:14:32,486
under Core Motion Framework, and

330
00:14:32,486 --> 0:14:34,756
it provides some additional

331
00:14:34,926 --> 0:14:37,906
normalization, time alignment,

332
00:14:38,106 --> 0:14:39,506
or bias removal.

333
00:14:40,506 --> 0:14:42,496
So sometimes it could be really

334
00:14:42,496 --> 0:14:46,086
helpful for you to process the

335
00:14:46,746 --> 0:14:46,866
data.

336
00:14:48,076 --> 0:14:48,946
And that's Activity.

337
00:14:49,516 --> 0:14:54,500
[ Applause ]
