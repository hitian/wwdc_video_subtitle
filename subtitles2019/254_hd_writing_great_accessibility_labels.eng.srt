00:00:13,766 --> 0:00:14,876
&gt;&gt; Good morning everyone.

3
00:00:16,486 --> 0:00:16,976
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

4
00:00:17,706 --> 0:00:19,576
&gt;&gt; My name is Jordyn Castor and

5
00:00:19,576 --> 0:00:21,056
I work here at Apple on the

6
00:00:21,056 --> 0:00:23,146
Accessibility Design and Quality

7
00:00:23,146 --> 0:00:23,636
Team.

8
00:00:23,986 --> 0:00:29,456
I'm so excited to be here today.

9
00:00:30,216 --> 0:00:32,735
Accessibility is built into our

10
00:00:32,735 --> 0:00:34,496
hardware and software design

11
00:00:34,676 --> 0:00:35,446
here at Apple.

12
00:00:37,346 --> 0:00:39,356
We believe accessibility is a

13
00:00:39,356 --> 0:00:41,606
human right and it's one of our

14
00:00:41,606 --> 0:00:42,476
core values.

15
00:00:43,936 --> 0:00:46,206
When I download an app, there's

16
00:00:46,206 --> 0:00:48,566
an expectation that it just

17
00:00:48,696 --> 0:00:49,356
works.

18
00:00:49,996 --> 0:00:51,866
And I'm able to access all of

19
00:00:51,866 --> 0:00:54,266
the buttons, controls, and

20
00:00:54,266 --> 0:00:56,206
information using VoiceOver.

21
00:00:56,816 --> 0:00:59,386
To be honest, I give an app a

22
00:00:59,526 --> 0:01:02,166
first 30 second glance and if I

23
00:00:59,526 --> 0:01:02,166
first 30 second glance and if I

24
00:01:02,166 --> 0:01:03,776
can't access any of the

25
00:01:03,776 --> 0:01:06,236
functionality, I delete it.

26
00:01:07,096 --> 0:01:08,896
Now, I really, really want to

27
00:01:08,896 --> 0:01:09,956
use your applications.

28
00:01:10,136 --> 0:01:12,766
I do. But, one of the most

29
00:01:12,766 --> 0:01:14,916
crucial aspects to our built-in

30
00:01:14,986 --> 0:01:17,346
features like VoiceOver, Speak

31
00:01:17,346 --> 0:01:20,496
Screen, and Voice Control being

32
00:01:20,496 --> 0:01:22,156
able to access the functionality

33
00:01:22,156 --> 0:01:24,406
of your app is by the labeling

34
00:01:24,406 --> 0:01:26,186
of your buttons, and text

35
00:01:26,186 --> 0:01:28,496
fields, controls, and other

36
00:01:28,496 --> 0:01:29,026
elements.

37
00:01:29,846 --> 0:01:33,866
So today, I'm going to talk to

38
00:01:33,866 --> 0:01:35,956
you about what an accessibility

39
00:01:35,956 --> 0:01:38,616
label is, understanding the

40
00:01:38,616 --> 0:01:40,646
context for writing great

41
00:01:40,646 --> 0:01:43,496
labels, and best practices.

42
00:01:44,346 --> 0:01:48,446
So, let's -- so what is an

43
00:01:48,446 --> 0:01:49,556
accessibility label?

44
00:01:50,166 --> 0:01:55,056
Well, the definition is pretty

45
00:01:55,056 --> 0:01:55,456
short.

46
00:01:55,946 --> 0:01:57,916
It's a localized string that

47
00:01:57,916 --> 0:01:59,736
succinctly identifies the

48
00:01:59,736 --> 0:02:01,096
accessibility element.

49
00:01:59,736 --> 0:02:01,096
accessibility element.

50
00:02:02,166 --> 0:02:04,836
But let's unpack that a bit.

51
00:02:04,836 --> 0:02:06,706
Identifies the accessibility

52
00:02:06,706 --> 0:02:07,106
element.

53
00:02:07,786 --> 0:02:09,466
What does that mean exactly?

54
00:02:10,866 --> 0:02:12,906
It's a human readable, human

55
00:02:12,906 --> 0:02:15,146
understandable label that gives

56
00:02:15,186 --> 0:02:17,336
context and meaning for the

57
00:02:17,336 --> 0:02:19,326
elements in your app.

58
00:02:20,006 --> 0:02:22,756
And writing the code is pretty

59
00:02:22,756 --> 0:02:23,466
simple too.

60
00:02:23,466 --> 0:02:26,026
It's just getting or setting a

61
00:02:26,026 --> 0:02:26,446
string.

62
00:02:27,326 --> 0:02:28,826
But I get it.

63
00:02:29,106 --> 0:02:30,496
It's actually pretty difficult

64
00:02:30,716 --> 0:02:32,766
to accurately label the elements

65
00:02:32,806 --> 0:02:34,306
in your app.

66
00:02:34,306 --> 0:02:36,866
And as it turns out, that's all

67
00:02:36,986 --> 0:02:38,286
about the context.

68
00:02:39,166 --> 0:02:42,666
So that's what I'm going to help

69
00:02:42,666 --> 0:02:44,066
you understand in the next few

70
00:02:44,066 --> 0:02:46,026
minutes, is the importance of

71
00:02:46,056 --> 0:02:48,486
understanding context.

72
00:02:49,736 --> 0:02:51,776
So, let's dive right in.

73
00:02:52,856 --> 0:02:54,256
What should the label of this

74
00:02:54,326 --> 0:02:56,886
button be in your app?

75
00:02:57,556 --> 0:03:00,426
Well, by default it might be

76
00:02:57,556 --> 0:03:00,426
Well, by default it might be

77
00:03:00,456 --> 0:03:01,116
called plus.

78
00:03:01,116 --> 0:03:03,186
And I might be able to figure

79
00:03:03,186 --> 0:03:03,896
out what you meant.

80
00:03:04,956 --> 0:03:07,606
But, let's look at that with a

81
00:03:07,606 --> 0:03:09,386
bit more context.

82
00:03:11,536 --> 0:03:15,016
What about in a nav bar across

83
00:03:15,056 --> 0:03:16,216
from a back button?

84
00:03:16,586 --> 0:03:18,816
This is pretty common in iOS

85
00:03:18,816 --> 0:03:19,016
apps.

86
00:03:19,986 --> 0:03:21,296
What should the label of this

87
00:03:21,296 --> 0:03:22,466
button be here?

88
00:03:23,346 --> 0:03:27,296
Add? Well, that might be just

89
00:03:27,296 --> 0:03:27,776
dandy.

90
00:03:28,076 --> 0:03:30,556
If I'm in a notes app and I hear

91
00:03:30,556 --> 0:03:33,096
the word add, I'm going to know

92
00:03:33,096 --> 0:03:34,276
that that's going to add a new

93
00:03:34,276 --> 0:03:34,716
note.

94
00:03:35,266 --> 0:03:37,366
But remember, these labels are

95
00:03:37,366 --> 0:03:38,736
supposed to be succinct.

96
00:03:38,736 --> 0:03:43,066
In a shopping context I might

97
00:03:43,066 --> 0:03:44,756
need to clarify that a bit

98
00:03:44,836 --> 0:03:47,066
further to distinguish this app

99
00:03:47,066 --> 0:03:49,146
button from other actions like

100
00:03:49,496 --> 0:03:50,546
Add to Favorites.

101
00:03:51,246 --> 0:03:53,826
So, we might need to call that

102
00:03:53,826 --> 0:03:54,466
Add to Cart.

103
00:03:56,656 --> 0:03:58,716
And, what if there were dozens

104
00:03:58,916 --> 0:04:00,246
of Add to Cart buttons?

105
00:03:58,916 --> 0:04:00,246
of Add to Cart buttons?

106
00:04:00,606 --> 0:04:02,806
In this context I might expect

107
00:04:02,806 --> 0:04:05,036
VoiceOver to say, add peanut

108
00:04:05,036 --> 0:04:05,946
butter to cart.

109
00:04:06,606 --> 0:04:08,496
And hopefully it's not crunchy

110
00:04:08,496 --> 0:04:09,636
peanut butter.

111
00:04:10,816 --> 0:04:13,116
To bring it back to the original

112
00:04:13,116 --> 0:04:15,056
example, what should the label

113
00:04:15,056 --> 0:04:16,826
of this button be in your app?

114
00:04:18,076 --> 0:04:24,326
Well, that all depends on the

115
00:04:25,416 --> 0:04:25,976
context.

116
00:04:29,096 --> 0:04:30,116
So, now let's talk about some

117
00:04:30,116 --> 0:04:31,106
best practices when considering

118
00:04:31,106 --> 0:04:32,986
what a label should be.

119
00:04:33,796 --> 0:04:36,046
First and foremost, always,

120
00:04:36,126 --> 0:04:38,066
always remember to add labels to

121
00:04:38,066 --> 0:04:39,136
your apps.

122
00:04:39,136 --> 0:04:40,016
This is crucial.

123
00:04:40,016 --> 0:04:42,656
If a label's not added,

124
00:04:42,786 --> 0:04:44,246
VoiceOver might speak something

125
00:04:44,246 --> 0:04:44,646
like.

126
00:04:45,776 --> 0:04:47,646
&gt;&gt; Button, button, button.

127
00:04:47,776 --> 0:04:50,216
&gt;&gt; And for all I know guys, that

128
00:04:50,216 --> 0:04:51,666
could be the Delete hard drive

129
00:04:51,666 --> 0:04:53,966
Partition button and I wouldn't

130
00:04:53,966 --> 0:04:54,596
want to press that.

131
00:04:56,606 --> 0:04:58,696
If there is no label added and

132
00:04:58,696 --> 0:05:00,396
if there's an image in the

133
00:04:58,696 --> 0:05:00,396
if there's an image in the

134
00:05:00,396 --> 0:05:01,926
button or if there's an image

135
00:05:01,926 --> 0:05:04,096
within the button, VoiceOver

136
00:05:04,096 --> 0:05:06,286
might speak something like --

137
00:05:07,276 --> 0:05:08,186
&gt;&gt; Plus underscore icon

138
00:05:08,186 --> 0:05:09,256
underscore outline underscore

139
00:05:09,256 --> 0:05:10,156
hash nine, nine, nine, nine,

140
00:05:10,156 --> 0:05:11,766
nine, nine, dot.

141
00:05:11,936 --> 0:05:14,036
&gt;&gt; What? What does that even

142
00:05:14,036 --> 0:05:14,546
mean?

143
00:05:16,006 --> 0:05:20,006
So please, please guys, add

144
00:05:21,476 --> 0:05:21,696
labels.

145
00:05:22,196 --> 0:05:23,776
VoiceOver knows what the element

146
00:05:23,776 --> 0:05:25,646
in your apps is based on the

147
00:05:25,646 --> 0:05:26,396
element type.

148
00:05:27,046 --> 0:05:30,216
So, it's redundant to add text

149
00:05:30,276 --> 0:05:32,126
to your string like button or

150
00:05:32,126 --> 0:05:32,566
tab.

151
00:05:32,966 --> 0:05:35,486
And if you do, VoiceOver would

152
00:05:35,486 --> 0:05:36,616
read out the label like --

153
00:05:36,726 --> 0:05:38,486
&gt;&gt; Add button button.

154
00:05:38,996 --> 0:05:41,086
&gt;&gt; Hearing this though --

155
00:05:41,136 --> 0:05:42,666
&gt;&gt; Add button.

156
00:05:42,806 --> 0:05:43,986
&gt;&gt; Makes much more sense.

157
00:05:44,556 --> 0:05:48,896
Remember to update the label

158
00:05:48,896 --> 0:05:50,196
when the UI changes.

159
00:05:50,446 --> 0:05:52,986
So, if you have an add button --

160
00:05:53,956 --> 0:05:54,746
&gt;&gt; Add button.

161
00:05:54,876 --> 0:05:56,366
&gt;&gt; That changes to a delete

162
00:05:56,366 --> 0:05:56,756
button --

163
00:05:57,346 --> 0:05:59,476
&gt;&gt; Delete button.

164
00:05:59,476 --> 0:06:01,396
&gt;&gt; Remember to update your UI so

165
00:05:59,476 --> 0:06:01,396
&gt;&gt; Remember to update your UI so

166
00:06:01,396 --> 0:06:02,296
that the label, so that

167
00:06:02,296 --> 0:06:03,536
VoiceOver will speak the correct

168
00:06:03,536 --> 0:06:07,306
state of the button.

169
00:06:07,966 --> 0:06:09,746
When there's multiple buttons

170
00:06:09,746 --> 0:06:12,076
with the same action like adding

171
00:06:12,076 --> 0:06:14,166
an item to the cart, remember to

172
00:06:14,166 --> 0:06:15,426
provide the context.

173
00:06:16,536 --> 0:06:18,716
Here it's not clear what I'm

174
00:06:18,716 --> 0:06:19,076
adding.

175
00:06:20,076 --> 0:06:20,866
&gt;&gt; Add button.

176
00:06:21,356 --> 0:06:22,976
&gt;&gt; Am I adding the peanut

177
00:06:22,976 --> 0:06:26,526
butter, the bananas, or the

178
00:06:26,526 --> 0:06:27,146
cookies?

179
00:06:27,296 --> 0:06:29,086
Oh, I love cookies.

180
00:06:30,926 --> 0:06:32,506
The context is much more clear

181
00:06:32,506 --> 0:06:33,216
here.

182
00:06:33,216 --> 0:06:36,486
&gt;&gt; Add peanut butter button.

183
00:06:36,486 --> 0:06:37,436
&gt;&gt; Oh, we're adding the peanut

184
00:06:37,436 --> 0:06:37,926
butter.

185
00:06:38,536 --> 0:06:39,696
Hopefully it's not crunchy.

186
00:06:42,496 --> 0:06:45,226
Avoid redundant labels.

187
00:06:45,736 --> 0:06:47,836
So, if I'm in a music player the

188
00:06:47,836 --> 0:06:49,836
context is clear that we're

189
00:06:49,836 --> 0:06:51,476
dealing with songs.

190
00:06:51,996 --> 0:06:54,156
So, having VoiceOver speak --

191
00:06:55,306 --> 0:06:56,966
&gt;&gt; Play song button.

192
00:06:56,966 --> 0:07:00,556
&gt;&gt; Or next song, is unnecessary.

193
00:06:56,966 --> 0:07:00,556
&gt;&gt; Or next song, is unnecessary.

194
00:07:01,066 --> 0:07:02,786
I'd much rather hear VoiceOver

195
00:07:02,786 --> 0:07:03,316
speak --

196
00:07:04,306 --> 0:07:05,196
&gt;&gt; Play button.

197
00:07:05,196 --> 0:07:08,176
&gt;&gt; Just the word play.

198
00:07:08,536 --> 0:07:11,566
It's also great to add labels to

199
00:07:11,566 --> 0:07:12,956
your animations, such as your

200
00:07:12,956 --> 0:07:13,536
spinners.

201
00:07:13,816 --> 0:07:15,306
So that VoiceOver will let me

202
00:07:15,306 --> 0:07:17,146
know that the content in your

203
00:07:17,146 --> 0:07:18,156
app is --

204
00:07:18,856 --> 0:07:19,516
&gt;&gt; Loading.

205
00:07:19,516 --> 0:07:20,156
&gt;&gt; Loading.

206
00:07:20,156 --> 0:07:21,106
That's really important.

207
00:07:23,786 --> 0:07:25,046
So, this --

208
00:07:26,366 --> 0:07:27,496
&gt;&gt; Delete items from the current

209
00:07:27,496 --> 0:07:28,726
folder and add it to the trash

210
00:07:28,726 --> 0:07:29,096
button.

211
00:07:29,186 --> 0:07:30,436
&gt;&gt; That is too verbose.

212
00:07:31,476 --> 0:07:33,626
Remember, we want these labels

213
00:07:33,666 --> 0:07:36,356
to be as succinct as possible.

214
00:07:37,526 --> 0:07:39,516
And, the context really makes

215
00:07:39,516 --> 0:07:41,226
things in your app clear.

216
00:07:41,396 --> 0:07:42,406
So, this --

217
00:07:43,496 --> 0:07:44,256
&gt;&gt; Delete button.

218
00:07:44,436 --> 0:07:46,666
&gt;&gt; Would be just fine.

219
00:07:48,496 --> 0:07:51,626
But verbosity isn't always a bad

220
00:07:51,666 --> 0:07:52,156
thing though.

221
00:07:52,936 --> 0:07:55,516
Oftentimes verbose descriptions

222
00:07:55,926 --> 0:07:57,446
when in appropriate situations

223
00:07:57,686 --> 0:07:59,136
is really what makes your app

224
00:07:59,416 --> 0:08:00,746
fun and memorable.

225
00:07:59,416 --> 0:08:00,746
fun and memorable.

226
00:08:01,546 --> 0:08:02,886
The developers of the Cookie

227
00:08:02,886 --> 0:08:05,046
Monster sticker packs have added

228
00:08:05,046 --> 0:08:07,876
verbose but really fun labels to

229
00:08:07,876 --> 0:08:08,526
their stickers.

230
00:08:08,926 --> 0:08:11,076
So now, VoiceOver speaks --

231
00:08:12,086 --> 0:08:13,216
&gt;&gt; Me happy face eat small

232
00:08:13,216 --> 0:08:15,456
cookie, om nom nom button.

233
00:08:15,456 --> 0:08:16,856
&gt;&gt; I love that.

234
00:08:17,016 --> 0:08:18,166
That is so awesome.

235
00:08:18,776 --> 0:08:20,176
These Cookie Monster stickers

236
00:08:20,246 --> 0:08:22,776
are intended to be fun and just

237
00:08:22,936 --> 0:08:24,306
make a person smile.

238
00:08:24,706 --> 0:08:26,556
Whether you can see the sticker

239
00:08:26,826 --> 0:08:28,116
or you hear the label.

240
00:08:29,376 --> 0:08:30,856
So, let's review.

241
00:08:32,696 --> 0:08:35,846
Remember to add labels so that

242
00:08:35,846 --> 0:08:37,846
VoiceOver doesn't speak "button,

243
00:08:38,395 --> 0:08:39,586
button, button."

244
00:08:40,216 --> 0:08:43,796
Don't include the element type

245
00:08:43,796 --> 0:08:45,646
in your label because VoiceOver

246
00:08:45,646 --> 0:08:47,516
gathers that info already.

247
00:08:47,936 --> 0:08:50,616
So, hearing add button button is

248
00:08:50,616 --> 0:08:51,576
unnecessary.

249
00:08:53,116 --> 0:08:55,016
Update the labels when your UI

250
00:08:55,226 --> 0:08:55,646
changes.

251
00:08:56,276 --> 0:08:57,526
So, when you have that add

252
00:08:57,556 --> 0:08:59,016
button that changes to a delete

253
00:08:59,016 --> 0:09:00,906
button, remember to update your

254
00:08:59,016 --> 0:09:00,906
button, remember to update your

255
00:09:00,906 --> 0:09:02,396
label so VoiceOver reads the

256
00:09:02,396 --> 0:09:03,836
correct state of the button.

257
00:09:05,886 --> 0:09:09,236
Avoid redundancy like play song,

258
00:09:09,546 --> 0:09:11,146
next song, previous song.

259
00:09:11,676 --> 0:09:13,846
In a music player, remember to

260
00:09:13,846 --> 0:09:16,516
provide enough context so I know

261
00:09:16,516 --> 0:09:17,876
whether I'm adding peanut

262
00:09:17,876 --> 0:09:19,586
butter, bananas, or those

263
00:09:19,586 --> 0:09:20,976
awesome cookies to my cart.

264
00:09:24,536 --> 0:09:26,066
Add labels to your meaningful

265
00:09:26,066 --> 0:09:28,486
animations like spinners, so

266
00:09:28,486 --> 0:09:30,876
that VoiceOver will read that

267
00:09:30,876 --> 0:09:32,446
the content in your app is

268
00:09:32,526 --> 0:09:35,986
loading or in progress.

269
00:09:36,656 --> 0:09:39,416
Avoid verbose labels like delete

270
00:09:39,416 --> 0:09:41,016
current item from the trash and

271
00:09:41,016 --> 0:09:42,366
move it.

272
00:09:42,366 --> 0:09:44,176
Unless you have a great reason

273
00:09:44,176 --> 0:09:45,216
like those awesome Cookie

274
00:09:45,216 --> 0:09:46,846
Monster stickers.

275
00:09:48,536 --> 0:09:51,626
I really hope you've enjoyed

276
00:09:51,626 --> 0:09:53,396
learning about best practices

277
00:09:53,676 --> 0:09:55,586
for labeling your apps.

278
00:09:55,586 --> 0:09:57,526
But if you're ever curious what

279
00:09:57,526 --> 0:09:58,676
your app would sound like to a

280
00:09:58,676 --> 0:10:01,026
VoiceOver user, I really

281
00:09:58,676 --> 0:10:01,026
VoiceOver user, I really

282
00:10:01,026 --> 0:10:03,266
encourage you to turn it on and

283
00:10:03,266 --> 0:10:04,166
swipe around.

284
00:10:04,616 --> 0:10:07,066
It's really a great opportunity

285
00:10:07,126 --> 0:10:08,906
to improve your app for

286
00:10:08,906 --> 0:10:09,386
everyone.

287
00:10:10,176 --> 0:10:10,866
Thank you so much.
