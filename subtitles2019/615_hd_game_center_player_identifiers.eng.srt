00:00:06,476 --> 0:00:08,226
&gt;&gt; Hello. I'm Ben Harry from the

3
00:00:08,226 --> 0:00:09,466
Game Center Engineering team.

4
00:00:09,546 --> 0:00:12,166
In this presentation, I'm going

5
00:00:12,166 --> 0:00:13,546
to talk about Game Center player

6
00:00:13,546 --> 0:00:14,346
identifiers.

7
00:00:16,166 --> 0:00:17,716
To get started, I'm going to

8
00:00:17,716 --> 0:00:19,156
give you a brief overview of

9
00:00:19,156 --> 0:00:20,426
what Game Center offers to the

10
00:00:20,426 --> 0:00:21,486
players of your games.

11
00:00:23,426 --> 0:00:24,856
Game Center is a social gaming

12
00:00:24,856 --> 0:00:26,306
network that allows players to

13
00:00:26,306 --> 0:00:27,496
track their best scores on

14
00:00:27,496 --> 0:00:28,946
leaderboards, view their

15
00:00:28,946 --> 0:00:30,396
achievements earned playing your

16
00:00:30,396 --> 0:00:32,625
games, challenge their friends

17
00:00:32,625 --> 0:00:34,226
to complete an achievement or to

18
00:00:34,226 --> 0:00:36,876
beat a leaderboard score, and

19
00:00:36,876 --> 0:00:38,156
play either real-time or

20
00:00:38,156 --> 0:00:39,616
turn-based multiplayer games

21
00:00:39,616 --> 0:00:40,416
with their friends.

22
00:00:43,056 --> 0:00:44,116
At the heart of Game Center

23
00:00:44,116 --> 0:00:45,466
games are the players.

24
00:00:47,096 --> 0:00:48,316
Players are represented by

25
00:00:48,316 --> 0:00:49,606
objects that contain unique

26
00:00:49,606 --> 0:00:51,296
information that differentiate

27
00:00:51,296 --> 0:00:52,586
one player from another.

28
00:00:53,916 --> 0:00:55,326
The object used to represent

29
00:00:55,326 --> 0:00:56,606
Game Center players is the

30
00:00:56,606 --> 0:00:57,466
GKPlayer.

31
00:00:59,526 --> 0:01:01,296
Every GKPlayer has a unique

32
00:00:59,526 --> 0:01:01,296
Every GKPlayer has a unique

33
00:01:01,296 --> 0:01:02,976
nickname accessed by the alias

34
00:01:02,976 --> 0:01:03,476
property.

35
00:01:04,995 --> 0:01:06,346
A player may also choose an

36
00:01:06,346 --> 0:01:07,876
avatar image that will be used

37
00:01:07,876 --> 0:01:09,326
within Game Center UIs.

38
00:01:09,796 --> 0:01:12,546
In addition, each Game Center

39
00:01:12,546 --> 0:01:13,986
user has a unique static

40
00:01:13,986 --> 0:01:15,996
identifier that remains the same

41
00:01:15,996 --> 0:01:17,496
across all games that the player

42
00:01:17,496 --> 0:01:17,986
plays.

43
00:01:19,486 --> 0:01:20,896
You may use this identifier to

44
00:01:20,896 --> 0:01:22,516
store per-player information.

45
00:01:26,516 --> 0:01:27,896
Let me now talk about how a

46
00:01:27,896 --> 0:01:29,316
player static identifier

47
00:01:29,386 --> 0:01:30,666
currently works in Game Center.

48
00:01:32,016 --> 0:01:33,346
You may already be familiar with

49
00:01:33,376 --> 0:01:35,246
this, but let us consider this

50
00:01:35,246 --> 0:01:36,696
example in case you need to

51
00:01:36,696 --> 0:01:37,596
refresh your memory.

52
00:01:39,166 --> 0:01:40,896
Here we have two teams, Team A

53
00:01:40,896 --> 0:01:41,846
and Team B.

54
00:01:43,086 --> 0:01:44,836
In this presentation, I will be

55
00:01:44,836 --> 0:01:46,746
using the term team to represent

56
00:01:46,746 --> 0:01:48,716
a development team that releases

57
00:01:48,716 --> 0:01:50,276
a game to the App Store using

58
00:01:50,276 --> 0:01:51,276
App Store Connect.

59
00:01:52,586 --> 0:01:54,486
So, I have been playing two

60
00:01:54,486 --> 0:01:56,376
games from Team A and I also

61
00:01:56,376 --> 0:01:57,836
really enjoy the game from Team

62
00:01:57,836 --> 0:01:58,136
B.

63
00:01:59,166 --> 0:02:01,296
As we see, my static Game Center

64
00:01:59,166 --> 0:02:01,296
As we see, my static Game Center

65
00:02:01,296 --> 0:02:03,086
identifier is P123.

66
00:02:04,256 --> 0:02:05,466
Each of these games we'll see

67
00:02:05,466 --> 0:02:06,836
the same value from my

68
00:02:06,836 --> 0:02:08,636
identifier P123.

69
00:02:08,636 --> 0:02:11,476
No matter which game I play, I

70
00:02:11,476 --> 0:02:13,496
had the same static identifier.

71
00:02:14,746 --> 0:02:16,546
Going forward, we now want to

72
00:02:16,546 --> 0:02:18,246
increase privacy by introducing

73
00:02:18,246 --> 0:02:20,386
new player identifiers that are

74
00:02:20,386 --> 0:02:22,116
scoped to the either the team or

75
00:02:22,116 --> 0:02:23,146
the game itself.

76
00:02:25,306 --> 0:02:26,656
So let's begin with the first of

77
00:02:26,656 --> 0:02:28,486
these new identifiers, the team

78
00:02:28,486 --> 0:02:29,256
player ID.

79
00:02:30,466 --> 0:02:32,306
Remember that team refers to the

80
00:02:32,306 --> 0:02:34,026
development team that releases a

81
00:02:34,026 --> 0:02:35,186
game to the App Store.

82
00:02:36,416 --> 0:02:38,816
Again, consider Team A and Team

83
00:02:38,816 --> 0:02:40,776
B along with the same games from

84
00:02:40,776 --> 0:02:41,276
before.

85
00:02:42,836 --> 0:02:44,486
Notice that now I have two

86
00:02:44,486 --> 0:02:45,616
different identifiers.

87
00:02:46,346 --> 0:02:47,546
When I play either game from

88
00:02:47,546 --> 0:02:49,566
Team A, the value of my team

89
00:02:49,566 --> 0:02:50,976
player ID will be T11.

90
00:02:50,976 --> 0:02:53,446
When I play the game from Team

91
00:02:53,446 --> 0:02:55,486
B, the value of my team player

92
00:02:55,486 --> 0:02:57,216
ID will be T22.

93
00:02:58,596 --> 0:03:00,196
This means that the value of my

94
00:02:58,596 --> 0:03:00,196
This means that the value of my

95
00:03:00,196 --> 0:03:02,236
team player ID scoped to the

96
00:03:02,236 --> 0:03:03,836
team that releases the game I

97
00:03:03,836 --> 0:03:04,226
play.

98
00:03:05,646 --> 0:03:07,536
This is an improvement to player

99
00:03:07,536 --> 0:03:10,236
privacy as Team A will only know

100
00:03:10,236 --> 0:03:12,966
my team player ID as T11, and

101
00:03:12,966 --> 0:03:14,686
Team B will only know my team

102
00:03:14,686 --> 0:03:16,316
player ID as T22.

103
00:03:18,066 --> 0:03:19,926
So this is the team player ID.

104
00:03:20,946 --> 0:03:22,416
I now want to tell you about our

105
00:03:22,416 --> 0:03:24,066
other new player identifier, the

106
00:03:24,066 --> 0:03:25,106
game player ID.

107
00:03:28,046 --> 0:03:29,636
The game player ID is unique per

108
00:03:29,636 --> 0:03:30,526
game per player.

109
00:03:31,786 --> 0:03:33,416
This means that my game player

110
00:03:33,416 --> 0:03:35,396
ID is unique to each game that I

111
00:03:35,396 --> 0:03:35,816
play.

112
00:03:37,326 --> 0:03:39,276
Its value is also independent

113
00:03:39,276 --> 0:03:40,566
from the team that releases the

114
00:03:40,566 --> 0:03:40,926
game.

115
00:03:41,466 --> 0:03:44,446
Let us go back to our familiar

116
00:03:44,446 --> 0:03:46,556
teams, Team A and Team B.

117
00:03:47,196 --> 0:03:49,406
As you can see here, my game

118
00:03:49,406 --> 0:03:51,206
player ID is different for each

119
00:03:51,206 --> 0:03:53,846
game that I play, regardless of

120
00:03:53,846 --> 0:03:54,856
which team has released the

121
00:03:54,856 --> 0:03:55,156
game.

122
00:03:57,226 --> 0:03:58,496
To further show how a game

123
00:03:58,496 --> 0:04:00,146
player ID is independent from

124
00:03:58,496 --> 0:04:00,146
player ID is independent from

125
00:04:00,146 --> 0:04:01,976
the team, let's consider the

126
00:04:01,976 --> 0:04:03,446
case when a game is transferred

127
00:04:03,446 --> 0:04:04,666
from one team to another.

128
00:04:05,196 --> 0:04:07,786
I am now going to show you what

129
00:04:07,786 --> 0:04:09,556
happens to my scoped identifiers

130
00:04:09,966 --> 0:04:11,396
when Game 2 is transferred from

131
00:04:11,396 --> 0:04:12,706
Team A to Team B.

132
00:04:15,066 --> 0:04:16,716
Let's say Team A transfers

133
00:04:16,716 --> 0:04:18,866
ownership of Game 2 to Team B.

134
00:04:20,026 --> 0:04:22,326
Now, when I play Game 2, my game

135
00:04:22,326 --> 0:04:24,016
player ID for Game 2 remains

136
00:04:24,016 --> 0:04:24,716
unchanged.

137
00:04:26,346 --> 0:04:28,136
My game player ID for Game 2

138
00:04:28,136 --> 0:04:29,876
persisted with the game and is

139
00:04:29,876 --> 0:04:31,196
independent of the team.

140
00:04:33,416 --> 0:04:35,266
Now, you may have also noticed

141
00:04:35,266 --> 0:04:36,546
something about my team player

142
00:04:36,546 --> 0:04:37,606
ID for Game 2.

143
00:04:39,046 --> 0:04:40,786
My team player ID for Game 2

144
00:04:40,786 --> 0:04:42,526
took on the value for Team B

145
00:04:43,006 --> 0:04:44,226
since it is now released to the

146
00:04:44,226 --> 0:04:45,416
App Store by Team B.

147
00:04:47,846 --> 0:04:49,176
So we have come to the scoping

148
00:04:49,176 --> 0:04:50,086
of the new Game Center

149
00:04:50,086 --> 0:04:51,456
identifiers and also what

150
00:04:51,456 --> 0:04:52,886
happens to these identifiers

151
00:04:52,886 --> 0:04:53,966
when game ownership is

152
00:04:53,966 --> 0:04:54,596
transferred.

153
00:04:56,326 --> 0:04:57,866
I am now going to talk about how

154
00:04:57,866 --> 0:04:59,016
you may use the scope

155
00:04:59,016 --> 0:05:00,456
identifiers in the games that

156
00:04:59,016 --> 0:05:00,456
identifiers in the games that

157
00:05:00,456 --> 0:05:01,096
you develop.

158
00:05:04,216 --> 0:05:05,636
As you have seen, we have added

159
00:05:05,636 --> 0:05:07,296
two new scope identifiers to the

160
00:05:07,296 --> 0:05:09,596
GKPlayer, the team player ID and

161
00:05:09,596 --> 0:05:10,766
the game player ID.

162
00:05:11,256 --> 0:05:14,446
The team player ID and game

163
00:05:14,446 --> 0:05:16,066
player ID have been introduced

164
00:05:16,066 --> 0:05:17,156
with the goal of increasing

165
00:05:17,156 --> 0:05:19,586
player privacy, which aligned to

166
00:05:19,586 --> 0:05:20,666
the Apple's commitment to

167
00:05:20,666 --> 0:05:22,256
protecting the privacy of our

168
00:05:22,256 --> 0:05:22,786
users.

169
00:05:24,946 --> 0:05:26,436
This new identifiers replaced

170
00:05:26,436 --> 0:05:28,186
the existing static identifier

171
00:05:28,646 --> 0:05:30,356
or player ID on a GKPlayer.

172
00:05:32,986 --> 0:05:34,506
The playerID property is now

173
00:05:34,506 --> 0:05:35,276
deprecated.

174
00:05:35,806 --> 0:05:36,926
So I encourage you to start

175
00:05:36,926 --> 0:05:37,836
using these new scope

176
00:05:37,836 --> 0:05:38,886
identifiers today.

177
00:05:41,956 --> 0:05:43,736
As I mentioned earlier, the team

178
00:05:43,736 --> 0:05:45,256
player ID and game player ID

179
00:05:45,256 --> 0:05:46,866
have been introduced to replace

180
00:05:46,866 --> 0:05:48,036
the static player ID.

181
00:05:49,206 --> 0:05:50,786
If you don't query the player ID

182
00:05:50,786 --> 0:05:52,286
in your games, then you will not

183
00:05:52,286 --> 0:05:53,716
need to make any changes.

184
00:05:55,286 --> 0:05:56,716
If you do query the player ID,

185
00:05:56,716 --> 0:05:58,386
you'll need to switch to the new

186
00:05:58,386 --> 0:05:59,566
scoped identifiers.

187
00:06:01,026 --> 0:06:02,416
You'll be using the team player

188
00:06:02,416 --> 0:06:03,616
ID in most cases.

189
00:06:05,256 --> 0:06:06,846
Likewise, if you currently use

190
00:06:06,846 --> 0:06:08,236
the static player ID to save

191
00:06:08,236 --> 0:06:10,146
game data, you should move to

192
00:06:10,146 --> 0:06:11,286
the team scoped ID.

193
00:06:12,406 --> 0:06:13,576
Doing so will handle the

194
00:06:13,576 --> 0:06:15,086
situation in the device you

195
00:06:15,086 --> 0:06:16,536
shared by multiple Game Center

196
00:06:16,536 --> 0:06:17,116
players.

197
00:06:18,896 --> 0:06:20,026
For those of you who may be

198
00:06:20,026 --> 0:06:21,496
persisting the static player ID

199
00:06:21,496 --> 0:06:24,116
in your own back end system, you

200
00:06:24,116 --> 0:06:25,526
should also update to the new

201
00:06:25,526 --> 0:06:26,736
scoped identifiers.

202
00:06:28,166 --> 0:06:29,686
You can do this any time after a

203
00:06:29,686 --> 0:06:31,046
successful authentication.

204
00:06:32,966 --> 0:06:35,086
Next, let me show you how scoped

205
00:06:35,086 --> 0:06:36,716
identifiers look for their local

206
00:06:36,716 --> 0:06:38,536
player as compared to non-local

207
00:06:38,536 --> 0:06:39,126
players.

208
00:06:40,716 --> 0:06:42,066
As you probably know, the

209
00:06:42,066 --> 0:06:44,136
GKLocalPlayer is the object that

210
00:06:44,136 --> 0:06:45,456
represents the authenticated

211
00:06:45,456 --> 0:06:47,246
Game Center player on a device.

212
00:06:47,956 --> 0:06:50,056
At any given time, only one

213
00:06:50,056 --> 0:06:51,616
player may be authenticated.

214
00:06:52,346 --> 0:06:54,536
And the GKLocalPlayer has a

215
00:06:54,536 --> 0:06:56,096
persistent team player ID and

216
00:06:56,096 --> 0:06:56,926
game player ID.

217
00:06:57,566 --> 0:06:59,766
But what about the GKPlayer?

218
00:07:00,436 --> 0:07:02,206
A GKPlayer object provides

219
00:07:02,206 --> 0:07:03,956
information about other players.

220
00:07:05,196 --> 0:07:06,686
These are non-local players and

221
00:07:06,686 --> 0:07:08,186
may be found in leaderboards

222
00:07:08,186 --> 0:07:09,706
recently played lists

223
00:07:09,706 --> 0:07:11,026
multiplayer matches and so

224
00:07:11,026 --> 0:07:11,386
forth.

225
00:07:13,086 --> 0:07:14,306
The scoped identifiers for

226
00:07:14,306 --> 0:07:16,266
GKPlayers will be instance based

227
00:07:16,266 --> 0:07:17,876
on the context in which they are

228
00:07:17,876 --> 0:07:18,346
used.

229
00:07:19,396 --> 0:07:21,426
For example, their scope to each

230
00:07:21,426 --> 0:07:22,796
instance of a leaderboard or

231
00:07:22,796 --> 0:07:24,396
each instance of a multiplayer

232
00:07:24,396 --> 0:07:26,656
match, which means that you

233
00:07:26,656 --> 0:07:28,286
cannot count on them to persist

234
00:07:28,286 --> 0:07:29,506
in subsequent matches.

235
00:07:32,566 --> 0:07:33,756
Let's say you have your own

236
00:07:33,756 --> 0:07:35,066
player accounting system.

237
00:07:35,216 --> 0:07:36,496
In which case, you'll be loading

238
00:07:36,496 --> 0:07:37,866
the corresponding GKPlayer

239
00:07:37,866 --> 0:07:38,456
objects.

240
00:07:39,266 --> 0:07:40,716
To do this, use the

241
00:07:40,716 --> 0:07:42,326
loadPlayersForIdentifiers:

242
00:07:42,406 --> 0:07:43,676
withCompletionHandler method

243
00:07:43,676 --> 0:07:44,906
found on GKPlayer.

244
00:07:46,456 --> 0:07:47,846
You may use either the team

245
00:07:47,846 --> 0:07:49,646
player ID or the game player ID

246
00:07:49,646 --> 0:07:51,006
for the identifiers.

247
00:07:53,436 --> 0:07:54,496
When you use the new

248
00:07:54,496 --> 0:07:56,246
identifiers, there is a very

249
00:07:56,516 --> 0:07:58,036
rare case where the scoped

250
00:07:58,036 --> 0:07:59,126
identifiers will not be

251
00:07:59,126 --> 0:07:59,606
available.

252
00:08:00,906 --> 0:08:02,196
So what should you do if the

253
00:08:02,196 --> 0:08:03,506
scoped identifiers are not

254
00:08:03,506 --> 0:08:03,956
available?

255
00:08:05,396 --> 0:08:06,986
Usually, when a player launches

256
00:08:06,986 --> 0:08:08,516
one of your games, the scoped

257
00:08:08,516 --> 0:08:10,246
identifiers for the local player

258
00:08:10,246 --> 0:08:11,346
will be available after

259
00:08:11,346 --> 0:08:12,636
successful authentication.

260
00:08:14,146 --> 0:08:16,296
However, there is a slim chance

261
00:08:16,296 --> 0:08:17,806
that the scoped identifiers may

262
00:08:17,936 --> 0:08:18,876
not be available.

263
00:08:19,826 --> 0:08:21,696
For this case, we've added a new

264
00:08:21,696 --> 0:08:23,046
API to GKPlayer.

265
00:08:23,486 --> 0:08:25,256
Scoped IDs are persistent.

266
00:08:26,686 --> 0:08:28,266
This property will be false if

267
00:08:28,266 --> 0:08:29,206
they are not available.

268
00:08:31,136 --> 0:08:32,416
This means that you'll need to

269
00:08:32,416 --> 0:08:34,066
check this property before using

270
00:08:34,066 --> 0:08:35,506
the team player ID or game

271
00:08:35,506 --> 0:08:36,976
player ID for the local player.

272
00:08:39,176 --> 0:08:40,206
So let's tie all this

273
00:08:40,206 --> 0:08:41,416
information together by

274
00:08:41,416 --> 0:08:43,025
considering an example of using

275
00:08:43,025 --> 0:08:44,546
the scoped identifiers after

276
00:08:44,546 --> 0:08:45,846
successful authentication.

277
00:08:48,316 --> 0:08:49,396
As you know, when the

278
00:08:49,396 --> 0:08:50,886
authenticate handler returns,

279
00:08:51,036 --> 0:08:52,486
you need to check if Game Center

280
00:08:52,486 --> 0:08:53,536
has returned you a view

281
00:08:53,536 --> 0:08:54,086
controller.

282
00:08:55,056 --> 0:08:56,666
If so, then you present the view

283
00:08:56,666 --> 0:08:57,826
controller when convenient.

284
00:09:00,916 --> 0:09:02,276
If there is no view controller

285
00:09:02,276 --> 0:09:03,206
and the local player has

286
00:09:03,206 --> 0:09:04,696
successfully authenticated, then

287
00:09:05,336 --> 0:09:06,376
you will be able to use the

288
00:09:06,376 --> 0:09:07,996
scoped identifiers after first

289
00:09:07,996 --> 0:09:09,636
checking the scoped IDs are a

290
00:09:09,636 --> 0:09:10,576
persistent value.

291
00:09:13,916 --> 0:09:15,286
If you are persisting the player

292
00:09:15,286 --> 0:09:17,166
ID in your own back end system,

293
00:09:17,816 --> 0:09:19,116
now is when you should convert

294
00:09:19,116 --> 0:09:20,596
from the old static identifier

295
00:09:20,596 --> 0:09:22,296
to the new scope identifiers.

296
00:09:22,506 --> 0:09:25,846
I will now wrap up by

297
00:09:25,846 --> 0:09:26,736
summarizing what I have

298
00:09:26,736 --> 0:09:27,496
presented today.

299
00:09:28,656 --> 0:09:30,036
Game Center is introducing new

300
00:09:30,036 --> 0:09:31,696
scoped identifiers with the goal

301
00:09:31,696 --> 0:09:33,106
of increasing player privacy.

302
00:09:33,666 --> 0:09:36,166
A player's team player ID is

303
00:09:36,166 --> 0:09:37,586
scoped to your development team.

304
00:09:38,556 --> 0:09:40,446
A player's game player ID is

305
00:09:40,446 --> 0:09:41,716
scoped to a game and will

306
00:09:41,716 --> 0:09:43,256
persist with that game if it is

307
00:09:43,256 --> 0:09:44,496
transferred from one developer

308
00:09:44,496 --> 0:09:45,066
to another.

309
00:09:46,836 --> 0:09:48,436
Use these new scoped identifiers

310
00:09:48,436 --> 0:09:50,096
in Game Center APIs as you will

311
00:09:50,096 --> 0:09:51,186
use the player ID.

312
00:09:51,476 --> 0:09:54,136
Both of these identifiers are

313
00:09:54,136 --> 0:09:55,536
available now so start using

314
00:09:55,536 --> 0:09:56,056
them today.

315
00:09:59,566 --> 0:10:00,786
For more information on this

316
00:09:59,566 --> 0:10:00,786
