00:00:07,806 --> 0:00:09,566
&gt;&gt; Good evening, developers, and

3
00:00:09,566 --> 0:00:13,376
welcome to the 2019 Apple Design

4
00:00:13,456 --> 0:00:13,666
Awards.

5
00:00:14,116 --> 0:00:16,065
Now, here's your host, Senior

6
00:00:16,146 --> 0:00:18,286
Director of Evangelism, John

00:00:19,516 --> 0:00:25,836
[ Music ]

9
00:00:26,336 --> 0:00:28,886
&gt;&gt; Hello. Well, hello, and

10
00:00:28,886 --> 0:00:30,806
welcome to another Apple Design

11
00:00:30,806 --> 0:00:31,176
Awards.

12
00:00:31,746 --> 0:00:32,936
Thanks for joining us this

13
00:00:32,936 --> 0:00:34,606
afternoon, especially after a

14
00:00:34,606 --> 0:00:36,756
long, but exciting day.

15
00:00:36,756 --> 0:00:39,116
And I just want to particularly

16
00:00:39,116 --> 0:00:40,716
thank all of you who have joined

17
00:00:40,716 --> 0:00:43,016
us from around the world online

18
00:00:43,316 --> 0:00:44,296
on the live stream for the

19
00:00:44,296 --> 0:00:45,246
ceremony right now.

20
00:00:45,386 --> 0:00:47,266
We've got a huge group.

21
00:00:50,136 --> 0:00:52,046
You know, it's great for us to

22
00:00:52,046 --> 0:00:53,626
join as a community, and gather

23
00:00:53,626 --> 0:00:55,856
like this to take a few moments

24
00:00:56,476 --> 0:00:58,686
to celebrate and acknowledge

25
00:00:58,966 --> 0:01:00,356
excellence in innovation and

26
00:00:58,966 --> 0:01:00,356
excellence in innovation and

27
00:01:00,356 --> 0:01:00,756
design.

28
00:01:01,996 --> 0:01:03,386
Because at Apple, we've been

29
00:01:03,386 --> 0:01:05,306
awarding excellent design for

30
00:01:05,306 --> 0:01:06,666
more than two decades now.

31
00:01:08,146 --> 0:01:09,886
What started originally as the

32
00:01:09,886 --> 0:01:11,556
Apple Human Interface Design

33
00:01:11,556 --> 0:01:13,196
Excellence Awards, or HIDE

34
00:01:13,196 --> 0:01:15,396
Awards for short, was renamed a

35
00:01:15,396 --> 0:01:17,606
few years later to what is now

36
00:01:17,606 --> 0:01:19,456
known as the Apple Design

37
00:01:19,456 --> 0:01:20,000
Awards.

38
00:01:22,116 --> 0:01:24,676
You know, the world around us is

39
00:01:24,856 --> 0:01:27,856
stunningly beautiful, and as

40
00:01:27,856 --> 0:01:29,616
humans, we're attracted to

41
00:01:29,616 --> 0:01:32,436
beautiful things, and to

42
00:01:32,436 --> 0:01:33,476
incredible designs.

43
00:01:34,796 --> 0:01:36,806
We're drawn to these things, and

44
00:01:36,806 --> 0:01:38,496
we respond to them deeply.

45
00:01:39,176 --> 0:01:42,056
And at Apple, we believe the

46
00:01:42,056 --> 0:01:43,466
true -- the beauty -- that

47
00:01:43,466 --> 0:01:44,916
beautiful design is both

48
00:01:44,916 --> 0:01:47,936
appearance and function, and

49
00:01:47,936 --> 0:01:49,796
something that works well with

50
00:01:49,796 --> 0:01:51,416
each component deeply

51
00:01:51,416 --> 0:01:53,046
considered, and each aspect

52
00:01:53,356 --> 0:01:55,326
carefully crafted -- that that

53
00:01:55,326 --> 0:01:56,986
can be profoundly beautiful.

54
00:01:58,366 --> 0:01:59,936
And so, simply judging something

55
00:01:59,936 --> 0:02:02,146
by how it looks isn't enough.

56
00:01:59,936 --> 0:02:02,146
by how it looks isn't enough.

57
00:02:03,256 --> 0:02:04,356
It's how it works.

58
00:02:04,896 --> 0:02:06,746
It has to work as beautifully as

59
00:02:06,746 --> 0:02:10,425
it looks, and great design

60
00:02:10,696 --> 0:02:12,126
reflects the broader definition

61
00:02:12,126 --> 0:02:12,946
of beauty.

62
00:02:13,196 --> 0:02:15,486
And it runs deeper than the

63
00:02:15,486 --> 0:02:16,066
interface.

64
00:02:16,496 --> 0:02:18,136
It's coherent, and it's

65
00:02:18,136 --> 0:02:19,116
cohesive.

66
00:02:19,116 --> 0:02:21,446
And it helps us to engage with

67
00:02:21,446 --> 0:02:23,276
each other in new, and

68
00:02:23,276 --> 0:02:25,176
innovative, and life-enhancing

69
00:02:25,176 --> 0:02:27,556
ways, and like compelling

70
00:02:27,556 --> 0:02:29,966
beauty, great design draws us

71
00:02:30,036 --> 0:02:30,736
in.

72
00:02:31,186 --> 0:02:33,836
And the Apple Design Awards have

73
00:02:33,836 --> 0:02:35,306
always been about this --

74
00:02:36,076 --> 0:02:38,026
recognizing great design, and

75
00:02:38,026 --> 0:02:40,526
then celebrating the developers

76
00:02:40,526 --> 0:02:42,486
who positively impact everyone

77
00:02:42,486 --> 0:02:44,226
else, and real people with the

78
00:02:44,226 --> 0:02:46,196
things that they create, the

79
00:02:46,296 --> 0:02:47,546
things that you create.

80
00:02:49,096 --> 0:02:51,116
Now, we select our winners each

81
00:02:51,116 --> 0:02:53,476
year by evaluating them in

82
00:02:53,476 --> 0:02:56,000
basically three key areas.

83
00:02:57,326 --> 0:02:58,616
The first area is design.

84
00:03:00,136 --> 0:03:01,836
We're looking for apps that are

85
00:03:02,176 --> 0:03:03,586
-- that have strong visual

86
00:03:03,586 --> 0:03:06,566
design, that are efficient and

87
00:03:06,566 --> 0:03:09,366
easy to use, that have great

88
00:03:09,366 --> 0:03:12,336
game play, that have attention

89
00:03:12,336 --> 0:03:15,136
to detail and polish, that are

90
00:03:15,136 --> 0:03:16,636
internally coherent.

91
00:03:17,136 --> 0:03:19,876
On the technology front, we're

92
00:03:19,876 --> 0:03:22,486
evaluating technology usage, and

93
00:03:22,486 --> 0:03:23,636
so we're looking for apps that

94
00:03:23,636 --> 0:03:25,096
are fast and responsive.

95
00:03:25,806 --> 0:03:27,216
We're looking for apps that take

96
00:03:27,366 --> 0:03:28,946
full advantage of all of the

97
00:03:28,946 --> 0:03:30,186
capabilities of our latest

98
00:03:30,216 --> 0:03:32,506
devices, and we're looking for

99
00:03:32,506 --> 0:03:34,926
apps that use the latest Apple

100
00:03:34,926 --> 0:03:37,686
technologies to do really great

101
00:03:37,736 --> 0:03:38,466
new things.

102
00:03:39,166 --> 0:03:41,836
And on the innovation front,

103
00:03:42,656 --> 0:03:44,216
we're looking for brilliance.

104
00:03:45,076 --> 0:03:47,306
We're looking for new ideas.

105
00:03:48,186 --> 0:03:50,296
We're looking for uniqueness,

106
00:03:51,556 --> 0:03:54,476
platform differentiation, and

107
00:03:54,546 --> 0:03:55,606
things that just weren't

108
00:03:55,606 --> 0:03:56,666
possible before.

109
00:03:57,306 --> 0:03:59,996
And the developers of our

110
00:03:59,996 --> 0:04:02,116
winning apps this evening have

111
00:03:59,996 --> 0:04:02,116
winning apps this evening have

112
00:04:02,116 --> 0:04:04,276
done an outstanding job, and

113
00:04:04,276 --> 0:04:06,086
outstanding work in these three

114
00:04:06,086 --> 0:04:09,106
areas, and more, and we want to

115
00:04:09,106 --> 0:04:10,096
honor that work.

116
00:04:10,896 --> 0:04:12,266
We want to acknowledge the

117
00:04:12,266 --> 0:04:14,766
distinct joy and the challenges

118
00:04:14,836 --> 0:04:16,466
of the app creation process that

119
00:04:16,466 --> 0:04:17,706
we're all so familiar with.

120
00:04:19,096 --> 0:04:20,426
We want to honor the endless

121
00:04:20,426 --> 0:04:22,926
hours, the late nights, and the

122
00:04:22,926 --> 0:04:24,886
dedication that goes into the

123
00:04:24,936 --> 0:04:26,006
pursuit of excellence.

124
00:04:26,736 --> 0:04:29,706
We want to recognize the

125
00:04:29,806 --> 0:04:32,196
dead-ends, and the frustration,

126
00:04:32,476 --> 0:04:34,196
and the exhaustion sometimes

127
00:04:34,676 --> 0:04:37,626
that often goes unseen, and

128
00:04:37,626 --> 0:04:38,786
we're all familiar with that.

129
00:04:39,956 --> 0:04:41,066
And we want to honor the

130
00:04:41,066 --> 0:04:43,086
unconventional thinking, the

131
00:04:43,086 --> 0:04:45,756
creativity, and the new ideas

132
00:04:46,066 --> 0:04:48,176
that lead to breakthroughs and

133
00:04:48,176 --> 0:04:49,496
innovative solutions.

134
00:04:50,046 --> 0:04:51,216
So let's get started.

135
00:04:52,696 --> 0:04:53,936
Winners tonight are going to win

136
00:04:53,936 --> 0:04:55,956
some pretty great -- some pretty

137
00:04:55,956 --> 0:04:58,846
amazing prizes, and each prize

138
00:04:58,846 --> 0:05:02,206
package includes a 512 gigabyte

139
00:04:58,846 --> 0:05:02,206
package includes a 512 gigabyte

140
00:05:02,206 --> 0:05:04,446
iPhone XS with a set of AirPods,

141
00:05:06,056 --> 0:05:09,456
a 512 gigabyte 12.9-inch iPad

142
00:05:09,566 --> 0:05:11,466
Pro with Apple Pencil 2,

143
00:05:11,946 --> 0:05:18,646
a 64 gigabyte 4K Apple TV, an

144
00:05:19,786 --> 0:05:22,346
Apple Watch Series 4,

145
00:05:22,926 --> 0:05:27,066
a top-of-the-line MacBook Pro,

146
00:05:27,486 --> 0:05:30,786
and a fully-loaded iMac Pro.

147
00:05:31,916 --> 0:05:33,306
In addition --

148
00:05:36,346 --> 0:05:37,606
in addition -- and this is what

149
00:05:37,606 --> 0:05:41,136
all of you want -- each winner

150
00:05:41,136 --> 0:05:42,786
will -- each winning develop --

151
00:05:42,786 --> 0:05:43,946
each winning app will be

152
00:05:43,946 --> 0:05:45,246
highlighted on the App Store,

153
00:05:45,246 --> 0:05:47,066
similar to what we did last year

154
00:05:47,066 --> 0:05:48,406
on the Today tab for the Apple

155
00:05:48,406 --> 0:05:49,776
Design Award winners, and what

156
00:05:49,776 --> 0:05:51,016
we did throughout the year

157
00:05:51,226 --> 0:05:52,506
following the ceremony.

158
00:05:52,896 --> 0:05:53,906
So this year's winners will be

159
00:05:53,906 --> 0:05:55,456
highlighted in prominent ways on

160
00:05:55,456 --> 0:05:56,246
the App Stores.

161
00:05:57,196 --> 0:05:58,546
And lastly, each winner will

162
00:05:58,546 --> 0:06:00,076
take home one of the coveted

163
00:05:58,546 --> 0:06:00,076
take home one of the coveted

164
00:06:00,076 --> 0:06:01,636
Apple Design Award trophies,

165
00:06:04,106 --> 0:06:06,776
except that we thought it was

166
00:06:06,856 --> 0:06:08,016
time for a refresh.

167
00:06:08,416 --> 0:06:11,476
And so, we have a completely new

168
00:06:11,476 --> 0:06:13,466
trophy this year, redesigned

169
00:06:13,596 --> 0:06:15,036
from the Apple Design Team.

170
00:06:15,496 --> 0:06:17,146
It retains the integrity and

171
00:06:17,146 --> 0:06:18,596
recognizable qualities of the

172
00:06:18,596 --> 0:06:21,166
original award, but reinterprets

173
00:06:21,166 --> 0:06:22,786
these with the qualities of our

174
00:06:22,786 --> 0:06:23,706
latest products.

175
00:06:24,116 --> 0:06:26,596
It's made out of 100% recycled

176
00:06:26,596 --> 0:06:27,686
aluminum, and featured a

177
00:06:27,686 --> 0:06:29,986
mirror-finished stainless steel

178
00:06:29,986 --> 0:06:31,766
Apple logo inlay.

179
00:06:32,486 --> 0:06:33,966
It's pretty sweet, if you ask

180
00:06:33,966 --> 0:06:34,330
me.

181
00:06:37,136 --> 0:06:37,326
All right.

182
00:06:38,156 --> 0:06:41,326
So we have nine -- we have nine

183
00:06:41,326 --> 0:06:43,546
winners today, and each winner

184
00:06:43,546 --> 0:06:45,336
will be announced and demoed by

185
00:06:45,336 --> 0:06:46,706
a colleague -- by colleagues of

186
00:06:46,706 --> 0:06:48,576
mine from the Apple -- from the

187
00:06:48,576 --> 0:06:49,446
-- from Apple's World Wide

188
00:06:49,446 --> 0:06:50,896
Developer Relations Team.

189
00:06:51,196 --> 0:06:52,706
Now, a little bit differently

190
00:06:52,706 --> 0:06:54,316
than other years -- if we

191
00:06:54,316 --> 0:06:55,846
announce your app, if we

192
00:06:55,846 --> 0:06:57,566
announce you as a winner, please

193
00:06:57,606 --> 0:06:59,596
stay in your seat because we're

194
00:06:59,596 --> 0:07:00,726
going to first talk about your

195
00:06:59,596 --> 0:07:00,726
going to first talk about your

196
00:07:00,726 --> 0:07:02,456
app, and explain it to the

197
00:07:02,456 --> 0:07:03,296
community.

00:08:44,676 --> 0:08:46,296
that it's intuitive enough so

247
00:08:46,296 --> 0:08:48,376
you simply start playing, and it

406
00:14:04,816 --> 0:14:06,706
of the interface here is

407
00:14:06,706 --> 0:14:08,536
customizing the drawing tools.

408
00:14:09,286 --> 0:14:10,866
Everything in this interface is

409
00:14:10,866 --> 0:14:12,336
animated, and they even have

410
00:14:12,436 --> 0:14:13,656
these really great optional

412
00:14:15,116 --> 0:14:16,126
Check out when you change the

413
00:14:16,126 --> 0:14:18,546
brush size, how the nibs change

414
00:14:18,546 --> 0:14:20,696
in response, or when you change

415
00:14:20,696 --> 0:14:23,386
the nibs, they pop on and pop

416
00:14:23,386 --> 0:14:23,736
off.

417
00:14:24,866 --> 0:14:26,086
But the heart of this interface

418
00:14:26,086 --> 0:14:27,256
is changing the color.

419
00:14:27,676 --> 0:14:29,636
You adjust the value on the side

420
00:14:29,636 --> 0:14:31,896
here on the right, swipe side to

421
00:14:31,996 --> 0:14:34,506
side to adjust saturation, and

422
00:14:34,506 --> 0:14:36,646
color by just spinning the color

423
00:14:36,646 --> 0:14:37,056
wheel.

424
00:14:37,926 --> 0:14:39,926
And check out how all of these

425
00:14:40,266 --> 0:14:41,646
-- all of these colors have

426
00:14:41,746 --> 0:14:42,706
unique names.

427
00:14:43,256 --> 0:14:45,166
There's 1400 names in all.

428
00:14:45,166 --> 0:14:46,876

430
00:14:48,216 --> 0:14:50,166
Now, I'm feeling inspired to

431
00:14:50,166 --> 0:14:52,356
actually draw something, so to

432
00:14:52,356 --> 0:14:54,236
extend the canvas and stay in a

433
00:14:54,236 --> 0:14:56,276
state of flow, I just swipe over

434
00:14:56,276 --> 0:14:56,946
to the side.

435
00:14:57,766 --> 0:14:59,256
I'll draw something in the theme

439
00:15:02,446 --> 0:15:03,596
hopefully I do this all right.

440
00:15:03,596 --> 0:15:05,596

442
00:15:07,046 --> 0:15:08,116

It's looking pretty good.

446
00:15:15,696 --> 0:15:18,136
It's a little bit flat, so I

447
00:15:18,246 --> 0:15:20,886
think I'm going to add in some

448
00:15:20,886 --> 0:15:21,676
shading.

449
00:15:22,416 --> 0:15:25,386

450
00:15:25,386 --> 0:15:25,786
realistic.

451
00:15:25,786 --> 0:15:29,616

that you see, what really

00:18:28,256 --> 0:18:29,756
impressed us about this game is

510
00:18:29,756 --> 0:18:31,226
that this kind of attention to

511
00:18:31,226 --> 0:18:33,696

516
00:18:40,486 --> 0:18:42,246
Notice how Frendt is taken aback

517
00:18:42,246 --> 0:18:43,716
when Arina's able to walk over

518
00:18:43,716 --> 0:18:45,896
the clouds, and then he catches

519
00:18:45,896 --> 0:18:47,716
up, still a little unsure.

520
00:18:47,716 --> 0:18:50,396
And here, I just stopped time,

521
00:18:50,496 --> 0:18:52,636
and I do that by just not

522
00:18:52,636 --> 0:18:54,456
tapping anything.

523
00:18:54,456 --> 0:18:55,616

Now, because you move both

530
00:19:06,196 --> 0:19:07,936
characters at once, and only

531
00:19:07,936 --> 0:19:09,986
control the flow of time, an

532
00:19:09,986 --> 0:19:11,426
interesting interplay happens

533
00:19:11,426 --> 0:19:13,876

more forward in time, and that's

00:28:11,196 --> 0:28:14,046
The Pixelmator team spent months

783
00:28:14,586 --> 0:28:16,866
training a custom Core ML model

784
00:28:16,866 --> 0:28:19,656
on over 20 million image pairs,

785
00:28:19,946 --> 0:28:21,906
and from that, they learned how

786
00:28:21,906 --> 0:28:24,156
to automatically control over 32

787
00:28:24,156 --> 0:28:25,876
different adjustments, from

788
00:28:25,876 --> 0:28:27,136
white balance, hue and

789
00:28:27,136 --> 0:28:29,426
saturation, lightness, color

790
00:28:29,426 --> 0:28:30,066
balance.

791
00:28:30,876 --> 0:28:31,996
Understanding all these

792
00:28:31,996 --> 0:28:33,716
individual adjustments on your

793
00:28:33,716 --> 0:28:36,346
own can be very daunting, but

794
00:28:36,346 --> 0:28:37,816
with the ML Enhance feature,

795
00:28:38,026 --> 0:28:39,496
it's a perfect place to start.

796
00:28:39,626 --> 0:28:41,366
I can do something like simply

797
00:28:41,366 --> 0:28:43,006
bump the black point just a

798
00:28:43,006 --> 0:28:45,186
little bit more, and I think

799
00:28:45,186 --> 0:28:46,026
that looks great.

800
00:28:46,756 --> 0:28:48,406
I can deep-press on this photo

801
00:28:48,406 --> 0:28:50,136
to compare it, and I think

802
00:28:50,136 --> 0:28:51,486
you'll agree that's a much

803
00:28:51,786 --> 0:28:53,236
better version of this image.

804
00:28:54,016 --> 0:28:55,666

805
00:28:56,696 --> 0:29:00,096

the app is fast, and it's

810
00:29:06,076 --> 0:29:06,756

The Pixelmator Team is

847
00:31:19,896 --> 0:31:21,626
While you play, you learn basic

physics and geometry with rhythm

849
00:31:24,126 --> 0:31:24,636

Now, music and sound effects are

key elements to helping you

00:31:28,906 --> 0:31:30,446
solve this chilled-out puzzle

&gt;&gt; I do, actually, Lauren.

863
00:31:43,176 --> 0:31:45,056
I actually love playing this

864
00:31:45,056 --> 0:31:47,296
game with my son, Luca.

865
00:31:47,296 --> 0:31:48,236
It's his favorite game right

866
00:31:48,236 --> 0:31:50,226
now, and the reason for that is

867
00:31:50,266 --> 0:31:51,396
that the first time you launch

868
00:31:51,396 --> 0:31:53,026
ELOH, you realize that there is

869
00:31:53,026 --> 0:31:53,706
no onboarding.

870
00:31:54,006 --> 0:31:55,266
There are no instructions.

871
00:31:55,846 --> 0:31:58,026
Just like many great iOS games,

872
00:31:58,026 --> 0:31:59,766
you just learn by playing.

873
00:32:00,416 --> 0:32:01,766
Now, the goal of the game is to

874
00:32:01,766 --> 0:32:03,656
get the little ball that emits

875
00:32:03,656 --> 0:32:05,496
from this speaker down to the

876
00:32:05,496 --> 0:32:07,686
target, and you do that by --

877
00:32:07,686 --> 0:32:09,886
you achieve that by tapping on

878
00:32:09,886 --> 0:32:12,566
these tribal masks, and moving

879
00:32:12,566 --> 0:32:14,436
them around the screen.

880
00:32:14,536 --> 0:32:14,866
Great.

881
00:32:15,076 --> 0:32:16,716
I think my reputation is saved.

882
00:32:16,716 --> 0:32:18,496
Level four is done.

883
00:32:18,496 --> 0:32:20,746
Now, the game has 99 levels, and

884
00:32:20,746 --> 0:32:23,256
as you would expect, things can

885
00:32:23,256 --> 0:32:25,486
get more complicated.

886
00:32:25,486 --> 0:32:28,546
Yet, the game still offers a

887
00:32:28,546 --> 0:32:30,866
very relaxing experience, and I

888
00:32:30,866 --> 0:32:32,956
think the key component here is

889
00:32:32,956 --> 0:32:34,396
the sound effects, and the

890
00:32:34,396 --> 0:32:36,646
soundtrack, which complements

891
00:32:36,646 --> 0:32:39,916
the beautiful graphics and

892
00:32:39,916 --> 0:32:41,076
delightful animations.

893
00:32:41,076 --> 0:32:43,006
And the other fun aspect is

894
00:32:43,006 --> 0:32:44,446
that, while you're playing,

895
00:32:44,636 --> 0:32:46,056
you're actually composing your

896
00:32:46,056 --> 0:32:47,646
very own soundtrack.

897
00:32:47,886 --> 0:32:48,216
Cool.

898
00:32:48,476 --> 0:32:52,736
Let's get through level 12.

899
00:32:52,926 --> 0:32:53,306
Great.

900
00:32:53,466 --> 0:32:54,906
Now, level 12 is special,

901
00:32:55,046 --> 0:32:57,116
because we get rewarded with a

902
00:32:57,116 --> 0:32:58,616

904
00:32:58,976 --> 0:33:00,826
What is also fun about this game

905
00:33:00,826 --> 0:33:02,346
is that there is no score.

[ Applause ]

1172
00:44:13,466 --> 0:44:14,616
&gt;&gt; All right, let's take a look.

1173
00:44:15,456 --> 0:44:17,616
The core of the experience is a

1174
00:44:17,616 --> 0:44:19,376
list of drills and workouts.

1175
00:44:19,536 --> 0:44:21,256
These drills are super-easy to

1176
00:44:21,256 --> 0:44:23,286
set up, and require no special

1177
00:44:23,286 --> 0:44:27,256
equipment, unless you count this

1178
00:44:28,356 --> 0:44:29,986
headband, which I carry

1179
00:44:30,226 --> 0:44:30,686
everywhere.

1180
00:44:31,466 --> 0:44:33,476
Let's do a dribbling drill.

1181
00:44:34,706 --> 0:44:36,776
&gt;&gt; In this case, we're going to

1182
00:44:36,776 --> 0:44:38,556
use a tripod, but it's just as

1183
00:44:38,556 --> 0:44:40,676
common to use your iPhone popped

1184
00:44:40,676 --> 0:44:42,346
up against a water bottle.

1185
00:44:42,986 --> 0:44:44,276
&gt;&gt; So the drill will get started

1186
00:44:44,276 --> 0:44:45,156
when I'm in the frame.

1187
00:44:45,486 --> 0:44:48,826
&gt;&gt; The iPhone camera, Core ML,

1188
00:44:48,826 --> 0:44:50,466
and Vision frameworks are doing

1189
00:44:50,466 --> 0:44:52,456
all the work, not Doug.

1190
00:44:52,946 --> 0:44:55,126
But to be fair, Doug is really

1191
00:44:55,126 --> 0:44:57,186
good, but even non-experts can

1192
00:44:57,186 --> 0:44:58,696
benefit from HomeCourt's ability

1193
00:44:58,696 --> 0:45:00,006
to make them a better basketball

1194
00:44:58,696 --> 0:45:00,006
to make them a better basketball

1195
00:45:00,006 --> 0:45:00,276
player.

1196
00:45:01,006 --> 0:45:02,476
Lower and faster dribbling will

1197
00:45:02,476 --> 0:45:03,566
make you score more points.

1198
00:45:03,916 --> 0:45:05,836
Faster, Doug, faster.

1199
00:45:06,596 --> 0:45:07,186
Good job.

1200
00:45:07,186 --> 0:45:09,396
&gt;&gt; So at the end of the drill, I

1201
00:45:09,396 --> 0:45:10,666
get a nice little summary.

1202
00:45:11,886 --> 0:45:13,136
&gt;&gt; And in addition to doing

1203
00:45:13,136 --> 0:45:14,196
these dribbling workouts,

1204
00:45:14,406 --> 0:45:15,816
HomeCourt is also great for

1205
00:45:15,816 --> 0:45:17,206
tracking shooting drills.

1206
00:45:17,526 --> 0:45:18,876
In fact, you can see up here on

1207
00:45:18,876 --> 0:45:20,536
the screen, it has tracked your

1208
00:45:20,536 --> 0:45:22,276
makes and your misses, as well

1209
00:45:22,276 --> 0:45:23,816
as where you shot the ball from.

1210
00:45:24,196 --> 0:45:25,816
In fact, it also gives you this

1211
00:45:25,816 --> 0:45:27,066
nice video where you can see

1212
00:45:27,066 --> 0:45:28,716
your shots, and where you took

1213
00:45:28,716 --> 0:45:29,376
them from.

1214
00:45:29,986 --> 0:45:32,116
You know, Doug, this is really

1215
00:45:32,116 --> 0:45:32,866
revolutionary.

1216
00:45:33,376 --> 0:45:34,776
&gt;&gt; It's true, Larry [laughter].

1217
00:45:35,946 --> 0:45:37,686
Before HomeCourt, you would have

1218
00:45:37,686 --> 0:45:39,056
to do this stuff manually.

1219
00:45:39,056 --> 0:45:41,176
You'd have to have someone track

1220
00:45:41,176 --> 0:45:41,726
it for you.

1221
00:45:42,276 --> 0:45:43,306
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.

1222
00:45:43,346 --> 0:45:45,356
And today, you see kids, and

1223
00:45:45,356 --> 0:45:47,636
even adults, using HomeCourt to

1224
00:45:47,636 --> 0:45:48,456
improve their skills.

1225
00:45:49,136 --> 0:45:50,346
&gt;&gt; So when you finish a drill,

1226
00:45:50,346 --> 0:45:51,476
you can actually share your

1227
00:45:51,476 --> 0:45:52,846
results with your friends, your

1228
00:45:52,916 --> 0:45:54,646

1231
00:45:57,886 --> 0:46:00,246
basketball is way more fun when

1232
00:45:57,886 --> 0:46:00,246
basketball is way more fun when
