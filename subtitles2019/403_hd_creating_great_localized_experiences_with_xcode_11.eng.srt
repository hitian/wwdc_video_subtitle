00:00:09,096 --> 0:00:10,916
&gt;&gt; [Applause] All right.

3
00:00:12,706 --> 0:00:13,286
Good morning.

4
00:00:14,686 --> 0:00:15,816
Thank you for attending this

5
00:00:15,916 --> 0:00:16,326
session.

6
00:00:16,896 --> 0:00:18,066
My name is Kulpreet.

7
00:00:18,066 --> 0:00:19,386
I'm a Software Engineer in

8
00:00:19,386 --> 0:00:21,206
Localization and I'll be joined

9
00:00:21,206 --> 0:00:22,766
by my colleagues Vivian and

10
00:00:22,766 --> 0:00:23,226
Arthur.

11
00:00:23,856 --> 0:00:26,576
In this session, I'll be going

12
00:00:26,576 --> 0:00:28,016
over some exciting new

13
00:00:28,016 --> 0:00:29,386
localization features in our

14
00:00:29,426 --> 0:00:29,946
platforms.

15
00:00:30,926 --> 0:00:32,095
Vivian and Arthur will then

16
00:00:32,095 --> 0:00:33,446
touch on some new tooling in

17
00:00:33,556 --> 0:00:35,496
Xcode 11, including some great

18
00:00:35,496 --> 0:00:36,986
enhancements to localization

19
00:00:36,986 --> 0:00:39,606
workflows, localizing images,

20
00:00:39,686 --> 0:00:41,756
and how you can use testing to

21
00:00:41,756 --> 0:00:43,516
generate screenshots of your app

22
00:00:43,516 --> 0:00:45,176
in any language.

23
00:00:47,056 --> 0:00:49,676
Today, we estimate over 70% of

24
00:00:49,676 --> 0:00:51,476
our users are outside the United

25
00:00:51,476 --> 0:00:52,046
States.

26
00:00:53,516 --> 0:00:55,186
Localization is an opportunity

27
00:00:55,186 --> 0:00:57,516
for you to expand your reach and

28
00:00:57,516 --> 0:00:59,026
capture new markets with your

29
00:00:59,026 --> 0:00:59,136
app.

30
00:01:01,596 --> 0:01:04,126
At Apple, we care deeply about

31
00:01:04,196 --> 0:01:05,946
creating a great experience for

32
00:01:05,946 --> 0:01:07,406
all of our users around the

33
00:01:07,406 --> 0:01:07,716
world.

34
00:01:07,716 --> 0:01:10,856
This year, we have a host of new

35
00:01:10,856 --> 0:01:12,746
features and improvements for

36
00:01:12,746 --> 0:01:13,896
our Multilingual and

37
00:01:13,896 --> 0:01:15,066
International Users.

38
00:01:16,196 --> 0:01:19,486
To name a few, in iOS 13 we have

39
00:01:19,616 --> 0:01:22,166
keyboards for 38 new languages.

40
00:01:23,066 --> 0:01:24,146
I'm sure if your language is up

41
00:01:24,146 --> 0:01:25,116
there you're really excited.

42
00:01:26,776 --> 0:01:28,096
We also have a new setup flow

43
00:01:28,096 --> 0:01:29,766
that guides multilingual users

44
00:01:29,766 --> 0:01:31,886
to the right language settings.

45
00:01:32,836 --> 0:01:34,766
Now one of these features I'm

46
00:01:34,766 --> 0:01:36,676
particularly excited about, and

47
00:01:36,726 --> 0:01:38,486
I want to dive a bit deeper with

48
00:01:39,136 --> 0:01:39,216
you.

49
00:01:40,326 --> 0:01:42,516
In iOS 13 there's a new setting

50
00:01:42,516 --> 0:01:43,786
that appears from Multilingual

51
00:01:43,786 --> 0:01:45,786
Users in your app settings page.

52
00:01:46,926 --> 0:01:48,506
I'm happy to say that users can

53
00:01:48,506 --> 0:01:49,906
now set the language of your app

54
00:01:50,496 --> 0:01:51,876
independent of the system

55
00:01:51,876 --> 0:01:52,346
language.

56
00:01:53,516 --> 0:01:56,696
[ Applause ]

57
00:01:57,196 --> 0:01:58,546
If a user has a connected watch,

58
00:01:58,876 --> 0:02:00,146
the setting will also sync to

59
00:01:58,876 --> 0:02:00,146
the setting will also sync to

60
00:02:00,146 --> 0:02:00,936
the accompanying watch

61
00:02:00,936 --> 0:02:01,646
application.

62
00:02:02,896 --> 0:02:04,826
And similarly, on macOS, users

63
00:02:04,826 --> 0:02:06,176
can set the language of an app

64
00:02:06,556 --> 0:02:07,966
via Language and Region

65
00:02:08,616 --> 0:02:08,946
preferences.

66
00:02:10,116 --> 0:02:12,366
This is important because in

67
00:02:12,366 --> 0:02:14,256
multilingual regions, users may

68
00:02:14,256 --> 0:02:15,346
prefer to use different

69
00:02:15,346 --> 0:02:16,696
languages in different context.

70
00:02:17,716 --> 0:02:19,046
In a region like Hong Kong,

71
00:02:19,196 --> 0:02:21,076
someone might read their news in

72
00:02:21,076 --> 0:02:22,166
Chinese even though they do

73
00:02:22,166 --> 0:02:23,496
their banking in English.

74
00:02:25,316 --> 0:02:27,136
In India, a student will go to

75
00:02:27,136 --> 0:02:29,396
school and learn in English even

76
00:02:29,396 --> 0:02:30,466
though they come home and speak

77
00:02:30,466 --> 0:02:31,576
Hindi with their family.

78
00:02:32,906 --> 0:02:34,386
Apps are windows into these

79
00:02:34,386 --> 0:02:36,476
interactions we have everyday.

80
00:02:36,836 --> 0:02:38,296
And this new setting allows

81
00:02:38,326 --> 0:02:39,916
users to choose a language that

82
00:02:39,916 --> 0:02:41,076
reflects their preference for

83
00:02:41,076 --> 0:02:42,446
your app.

84
00:02:43,236 --> 0:02:45,166
Now this works for your app out

85
00:02:45,166 --> 0:02:46,946
of the box and for free if

86
00:02:46,946 --> 0:02:48,276
you're using all of our standard

87
00:02:48,276 --> 0:02:49,496
foundation APIs for

88
00:02:49,496 --> 0:02:50,236
localization.

89
00:02:51,026 --> 0:02:51,966
But there are couple things to

90
00:02:51,966 --> 0:02:53,336
keep in mind to make this work

91
00:02:53,436 --> 0:02:54,446
great for your users.

92
00:02:55,046 --> 0:02:58,196
First, do not attempt to set the

93
00:02:58,196 --> 0:02:59,816
application language manually in

94
00:02:59,816 --> 0:03:00,166
code.

95
00:02:59,816 --> 0:03:00,166
code.

96
00:03:00,916 --> 0:03:02,806
Our APIs do a lot of work to

97
00:03:02,806 --> 0:03:04,036
ensure users get the right

98
00:03:04,036 --> 0:03:05,526
language and font fall backs.

99
00:03:06,626 --> 0:03:07,956
If you do need to add the option

100
00:03:07,956 --> 0:03:08,966
within your app to switch

101
00:03:08,966 --> 0:03:10,666
languages, we recommend you

102
00:03:10,666 --> 0:03:12,126
Launch into Settings where users

103
00:03:12,126 --> 0:03:13,216
can go in and switch the

104
00:03:13,216 --> 0:03:14,766
language of your app.

105
00:03:15,696 --> 0:03:18,386
Next, when the user does change

106
00:03:18,386 --> 0:03:21,366
the language of your app, your

107
00:03:21,536 --> 0:03:23,106
app will be relaunched in the

108
00:03:23,106 --> 0:03:23,976
target language.

109
00:03:24,826 --> 0:03:25,976
Now, to make this language

110
00:03:25,976 --> 0:03:27,616
change a seamless experience for

111
00:03:27,616 --> 0:03:29,436
the user, we recommend you adapt

112
00:03:29,726 --> 0:03:31,946
state restoration APIs.

113
00:03:32,636 --> 0:03:34,526
In iOS 13, there are some new

114
00:03:34,526 --> 0:03:36,926
state restoration APIs with

115
00:03:36,926 --> 0:03:38,136
NSUserActivity.

116
00:03:38,546 --> 0:03:39,596
To learn more about how you can

117
00:03:39,596 --> 0:03:40,906
use them, you can check out this

118
00:03:40,906 --> 0:03:41,856
talk on Friday.

119
00:03:42,586 --> 0:03:45,796
And, finally, it's important

120
00:03:45,796 --> 0:03:47,076
that all of your content is

121
00:03:47,076 --> 0:03:48,596
shown consistently in one

122
00:03:48,596 --> 0:03:49,736
language throughout your app.

123
00:03:50,636 --> 0:03:51,966
If you're doing some custom or

124
00:03:52,056 --> 0:03:53,446
server-side resource loading,

125
00:03:53,816 --> 0:03:55,386
there are handful of APIs that

126
00:03:55,386 --> 0:03:56,556
might be useful for you to

127
00:03:56,556 --> 0:03:57,606
determine which language to

128
00:03:57,606 --> 0:03:58,676
request that content here.

129
00:03:59,766 --> 0:04:00,856
Let's go over a few of them.

130
00:03:59,766 --> 0:04:00,856
Let's go over a few of them.

131
00:04:02,406 --> 0:04:04,286
Locale APIs are useful for

132
00:04:04,286 --> 0:04:06,106
fetching the user's Language and

133
00:04:06,106 --> 0:04:07,016
Region preferences.

134
00:04:07,826 --> 0:04:09,536
Locale that preferred languages

135
00:04:09,776 --> 0:04:11,536
returns a list of languages in

136
00:04:11,536 --> 0:04:12,776
order of user preference.

137
00:04:13,636 --> 0:04:15,546
Now, this list might be useful

138
00:04:15,546 --> 0:04:18,375
to you if maybe you're building

139
00:04:18,375 --> 0:04:19,315
an app that needs to handle

140
00:04:19,315 --> 0:04:21,536
multilingual content, and you

141
00:04:21,536 --> 0:04:22,716
need to fetch resources such as

142
00:04:22,786 --> 0:04:24,476
font for all of the user's

143
00:04:24,476 --> 0:04:24,846
languages.

144
00:04:24,846 --> 0:04:27,876
And one thing to know is that

145
00:04:28,136 --> 0:04:29,396
locale, that preferred languages

146
00:04:29,396 --> 0:04:32,206
will return the language list,

147
00:04:32,296 --> 0:04:33,396
that user's preferred languages,

148
00:04:33,436 --> 0:04:35,016
regardless of the languages your

149
00:04:35,016 --> 0:04:36,356
application bundle supports.

150
00:04:36,816 --> 0:04:37,996
So it's not useful for getting

151
00:04:37,996 --> 0:04:39,196
the current running application

152
00:04:39,196 --> 0:04:39,626
language.

153
00:04:40,826 --> 0:04:41,746
To get the current running

154
00:04:41,746 --> 0:04:44,066
application language, we can use

155
00:04:44,066 --> 0:04:45,026
Bundle APIs.

156
00:04:45,786 --> 0:04:47,466
And Bundle APIs are useful for

157
00:04:47,466 --> 0:04:48,606
language matching.

158
00:04:49,296 --> 0:04:51,006
Bundle.main.preferred

159
00:04:51,006 --> 0:04:53,306
Localizations considers both the

160
00:04:53,756 --> 0:04:55,716
user preferred languages and the

161
00:04:55,716 --> 0:04:57,096
languages that your application

162
00:04:57,096 --> 0:04:58,896
bundle supports and returns a

163
00:04:58,896 --> 0:05:00,096
list of languages your

164
00:04:58,896 --> 0:05:00,096
list of languages your

165
00:05:00,096 --> 0:05:01,766
application Bundle supports in

166
00:05:01,766 --> 0:05:02,806
order of user preference.

167
00:05:04,386 --> 0:05:05,486
Now, if you have an external

168
00:05:05,486 --> 0:05:06,526
list, say if you're loading some

169
00:05:06,526 --> 0:05:08,226
remote content from a server and

170
00:05:08,226 --> 0:05:09,166
your server has a different

171
00:05:09,166 --> 0:05:10,646
setup supported languages, you

172
00:05:10,646 --> 0:05:11,786
can use the class method

173
00:05:11,866 --> 0:05:13,466
Bundle.preferredLocalizations

174
00:05:13,536 --> 0:05:13,806
from.

175
00:05:14,276 --> 0:05:15,706
And this will also consider that

176
00:05:15,766 --> 0:05:17,866
third language from your server.

177
00:05:19,616 --> 0:05:20,956
Now, to help walk you through

178
00:05:20,956 --> 0:05:22,786
this feature and what it means

179
00:05:22,786 --> 0:05:24,286
for your apps, I'd love to jump

180
00:05:24,286 --> 0:05:24,886
in to a demo.

181
00:05:25,516 --> 0:05:28,500
[ Applause ]

182
00:05:34,426 --> 0:05:37,706
OK. So, last year, we demo'd

183
00:05:37,706 --> 0:05:38,576
Vacation Planet.

184
00:05:38,936 --> 0:05:40,806
The first Interplanetary Travel

185
00:05:40,836 --> 0:05:42,266
Booking app, and we've since

186
00:05:42,266 --> 0:05:43,586
expanded the app to be able to

187
00:05:43,586 --> 0:05:44,736
book complete travel

188
00:05:44,736 --> 0:05:45,416
experiences.

189
00:05:46,136 --> 0:05:47,526
We had this new Discover tab

190
00:05:47,716 --> 0:05:48,766
with the collection view that

191
00:05:48,766 --> 0:05:50,266
shows some of our great

192
00:05:50,266 --> 0:05:51,546
offerings in these thumbnails

193
00:05:52,256 --> 0:05:55,256
like this romantic space cruise

194
00:05:55,256 --> 0:05:58,726
to Pluto or Moon Yoga.

195
00:06:00,396 --> 0:06:02,236
Now, some of these are seasonal

196
00:06:02,236 --> 0:06:03,876
offerings like this WWDC

197
00:06:03,876 --> 0:06:04,526
Afterparty.

198
00:06:05,146 --> 0:06:06,286
And because this is seasonal

199
00:06:06,286 --> 0:06:07,266
offering this content is

200
00:06:07,266 --> 0:06:08,726
actually pulled from our server.

201
00:06:09,036 --> 0:06:10,426
So this image and this great

202
00:06:10,426 --> 0:06:11,336
description about how this is

203
00:06:11,336 --> 0:06:12,846
the first Interstellar Bash and

204
00:06:12,936 --> 0:06:14,426
how we're going to be going on a

205
00:06:14,426 --> 0:06:15,856
onboard-- we're going to be

206
00:06:15,856 --> 0:06:17,836
going on a ship with an onboard

207
00:06:17,836 --> 0:06:19,756
seafood restaurant, the Codable,

208
00:06:19,756 --> 0:06:22,736
is actually being pulled from

209
00:06:22,736 --> 0:06:23,366
our server.

210
00:06:23,976 --> 0:06:25,406
Now, after reading that

211
00:06:25,406 --> 0:06:26,676
description, I think this looks

212
00:06:26,676 --> 0:06:27,886
great and I'm ready to book.

213
00:06:28,476 --> 0:06:30,966
But as you know, WWDC attendees

214
00:06:30,966 --> 0:06:32,336
has come from all around the

215
00:06:32,336 --> 0:06:34,106
world and they might prefer to

216
00:06:34,106 --> 0:06:35,386
do their travel booking in a

217
00:06:35,386 --> 0:06:36,156
different language.

218
00:06:37,156 --> 0:06:37,986
So, what I'm going to do is I'm

219
00:06:37,986 --> 0:06:39,006
going to go down to the profile

220
00:06:39,086 --> 0:06:40,406
tab where we have a table view

221
00:06:40,406 --> 0:06:41,656
cell that shows the current

222
00:06:41,656 --> 0:06:42,886
running application language.

223
00:06:43,436 --> 0:06:45,036
And when I click on that, it's

224
00:06:45,036 --> 0:06:46,086
going to pop me right into

225
00:06:46,136 --> 0:06:47,156
Settings where I can click in to

226
00:06:47,156 --> 0:06:48,846
see a list of all the languages

227
00:06:48,846 --> 0:06:49,946
my application supports.

228
00:06:50,436 --> 0:06:51,426
I'm going to go ahead and change

229
00:06:51,426 --> 0:06:52,026
this to French.

230
00:06:52,496 --> 0:06:53,696
And when I go back, you can see

231
00:06:53,696 --> 0:06:55,446
that the System UI is still in

232
00:06:55,446 --> 0:06:57,116
English but when I go back to

233
00:06:57,116 --> 0:06:58,846
Vacation Planet, the app will

234
00:06:58,846 --> 0:07:00,666
relaunch and it'll be in French.

235
00:06:58,846 --> 0:07:00,666
relaunch and it'll be in French.

236
00:07:01,516 --> 0:07:04,996
[ Applause ]

237
00:07:05,496 --> 0:07:06,976
Now, one thing you'll notice is

238
00:07:06,976 --> 0:07:08,016
that it actually brought me

239
00:07:08,016 --> 0:07:09,066
right back to where I left it

240
00:07:09,066 --> 0:07:10,076
and that's because I've adapted

241
00:07:10,076 --> 0:07:11,856
those state restoration APIs.

242
00:07:13,166 --> 0:07:14,376
And you can see now all of our

243
00:07:14,506 --> 0:07:15,616
strings and all of our date

244
00:07:15,616 --> 0:07:16,896
formatters are in French which

245
00:07:16,896 --> 0:07:17,716
is great.

246
00:07:18,026 --> 0:07:19,616
But when I go to that server

247
00:07:19,686 --> 0:07:21,156
side loaded content, I can see

248
00:07:21,156 --> 0:07:22,606
that that is still in English.

249
00:07:23,116 --> 0:07:24,236
Now that seems problematic

250
00:07:24,236 --> 0:07:25,406
because we want to be consistent

251
00:07:25,406 --> 0:07:26,526
in our app and we want their app

252
00:07:26,666 --> 0:07:27,596
to be in one language.

253
00:07:28,846 --> 0:07:29,706
So, let's take a look of what

254
00:07:29,706 --> 0:07:32,146
might be going on there.

255
00:07:32,416 --> 0:07:33,566
So, I'm here in our Collection

256
00:07:33,566 --> 0:07:35,706
View Controller and I have this

257
00:07:35,706 --> 0:07:37,376
method Local Discover Items that

258
00:07:37,416 --> 0:07:38,976
downloads that content from the

259
00:07:39,056 --> 0:07:39,416
server.

260
00:07:39,416 --> 0:07:40,666
And when we download that

261
00:07:40,666 --> 0:07:41,646
content, we actually need to

262
00:07:41,746 --> 0:07:42,966
pass in a language because the

263
00:07:43,026 --> 0:07:44,386
server needs to know what

264
00:07:44,476 --> 0:07:45,496
language are we fetching that

265
00:07:45,496 --> 0:07:46,116
content in.

266
00:07:47,036 --> 0:07:47,956
And here you can see that the

267
00:07:47,956 --> 0:07:48,906
language I'm passing in is

268
00:07:48,906 --> 0:07:50,766
Locale.preferredLanguages.first.

269
00:07:51,506 --> 0:07:52,306
As I mentioned before,

270
00:07:52,306 --> 0:07:53,706
Locale.preferredLanguages going

271
00:07:53,706 --> 0:07:55,926
to return the users preferred

272
00:07:55,926 --> 0:07:57,106
languages regardless of the

273
00:07:57,106 --> 0:07:58,246
language that my application

274
00:07:58,296 --> 0:07:58,676
supports.

275
00:07:59,526 --> 0:08:00,466
And so, this could be something

276
00:07:59,526 --> 0:08:00,466
And so, this could be something

277
00:08:00,466 --> 0:08:01,906
like Persian that my application

278
00:08:01,906 --> 0:08:03,116
doesn't necessarily support.

279
00:08:03,116 --> 0:08:05,896
Now, ideally, I'd like something

280
00:08:05,896 --> 0:08:07,026
that I'll consider the server

281
00:08:07,026 --> 0:08:08,336
support languages, my

282
00:08:08,336 --> 0:08:09,556
application bundle supported

283
00:08:09,556 --> 0:08:11,076
languages, in order of the

284
00:08:11,076 --> 0:08:12,086
user's preferences.

285
00:08:13,056 --> 0:08:14,046
So, I'm going to start by

286
00:08:14,096 --> 0:08:16,636
fetching the server's supported

287
00:08:16,636 --> 0:08:17,116
languages.

288
00:08:17,666 --> 0:08:18,446
You can see that here.

289
00:08:18,446 --> 0:08:20,126
And then I'm going to use that

290
00:08:20,196 --> 0:08:22,216
Bundle API, that class method on

291
00:08:22,216 --> 0:08:23,946
Bundle.preferredLocalizations

292
00:08:24,166 --> 0:08:25,806
from, and I'll pass in the

293
00:08:25,806 --> 0:08:27,186
availableServerLocalizations.

294
00:08:27,696 --> 0:08:28,986
And now the first element of

295
00:08:28,986 --> 0:08:30,556
this will be the best language

296
00:08:30,556 --> 0:08:33,626
to request that content and from

297
00:08:33,895 --> 0:08:35,905
the server.

298
00:08:37,306 --> 0:08:38,546
So I went ahead and I rebuilt.

299
00:08:43,606 --> 0:08:45,136
And wait a couple of seconds for

300
00:08:45,136 --> 0:08:45,926
it to relaunch.

301
00:08:46,756 --> 0:08:48,326
And you can see now that image

302
00:08:48,326 --> 0:08:49,626
and all of that content is in

303
00:08:49,626 --> 0:08:49,826
French.

304
00:08:50,216 --> 0:08:50,866
Isn't that great [applause]?

305
00:08:51,566 --> 0:08:53,016
Cool, so, I'm ready to book and

00:08:53,016 --> 0:08:53,956

308

All right.

00:08:57,956 --> 0:08:59,876
So, to summarize, App Language

Setting allows users to choose a

311
00:08:59,926 --> 0:09:02,146
Setting allows users to choose a

312
00:09:02,146 --> 0:09:04,186
language for your app.

313
00:09:05,126 --> 0:09:06,516
Launching to Settings is the

314
00:09:06,516 --> 0:09:08,556
best way to allow your users to

315
00:09:08,556 --> 0:09:09,656
switch the language of your app.

316
00:09:11,216 --> 0:09:12,886
Use state restoration to make

317
00:09:12,886 --> 0:09:14,266
that language switch a seamless

318
00:09:14,266 --> 0:09:15,736
experience for the user.

319
00:09:16,806 --> 0:09:17,786
And, finally, if you're doing

320
00:09:17,786 --> 0:09:19,046
some custom or server-side

321
00:09:19,046 --> 0:09:20,756
resource loading, be sure you're

322
00:09:20,756 --> 0:09:22,426
using the right bundle or locale

323
00:09:22,426 --> 0:09:24,666
API for your use case.

324
00:09:25,786 --> 0:09:28,076
I'm incredibly excited for all

325
00:09:28,076 --> 0:09:29,046
of the great features and

326
00:09:29,046 --> 0:09:30,196
enhancements we've worked on

327
00:09:30,196 --> 0:09:32,236
this year and can't wait to see

328
00:09:32,236 --> 0:09:33,096
how you're going to bring your

329
00:09:33,226 --> 0:09:34,236
apps to an international

330
00:09:34,236 --> 0:09:34,596
audience.

331
00:09:35,506 --> 0:09:37,446
Now to tell you how we've made

332
00:09:37,446 --> 0:09:38,566
it easier for you to do just

333
00:09:38,626 --> 0:09:39,756
that, I'd like to call up

&gt;&gt; Thanks Kulpreet.

338
00:09:47,686 --> 0:09:48,946
So, let's talk about some of the

339
00:09:48,946 --> 0:09:50,746
enhancements that localization

340
00:09:50,746 --> 0:09:53,786
tooling in Xcode.

341
00:09:53,786 --> 0:09:55,216
And this year, we've done a lot

342
00:09:55,216 --> 0:09:56,546
of things you've been asking

343
00:09:56,546 --> 0:09:58,316
for, so this is going to read a

344
00:09:58,316 --> 0:09:59,936
little like a wish list.

345
00:10:00,386 --> 0:10:03,006
First up, performance.

346
00:10:03,806 --> 0:10:05,566
So, I'm very excited to announce

347
00:10:05,736 --> 0:10:07,636
that exporting projects with

348
00:10:07,636 --> 0:10:09,746
lots of Interface Builder files

349
00:10:09,746 --> 0:10:12,146
for localization is now on

350
00:10:12,346 --> 0:10:15,976
average, 15 times faster.

351
00:10:16,516 --> 0:10:19,676
[ Applause ]

352
00:10:20,176 --> 0:10:21,536
So, this means if you had a

353
00:10:21,536 --> 0:10:22,996
project that was taking about a

354
00:10:22,996 --> 0:10:25,406
minute, that's going to be down

355
00:10:25,406 --> 0:10:25,976
to four seconds.

356
00:10:28,566 --> 0:10:31,246
And we did this by redesigning

357
00:10:31,246 --> 0:10:33,046
the string extraction process,

358
00:10:33,046 --> 0:10:34,866
so the more Interface Builder

359
00:10:34,956 --> 0:10:37,416
files you have, the bigger an

360
00:10:37,416 --> 0:10:39,236
improvement you're going to see.

361
00:10:39,736 --> 0:10:41,326
Also to really speed up and

362
00:10:41,326 --> 0:10:43,446
streamline your workflow, don't

363
00:10:43,446 --> 0:10:45,476
bother with calling genstrings

364
00:10:45,546 --> 0:10:48,716
or ibtool directly, instead use

365
00:10:48,716 --> 0:10:51,316
xcodebuild, exportlocalizations,

366
00:10:51,316 --> 0:10:53,356
and importlocalizations to take

367
00:10:53,356 --> 0:10:54,306
care of creating all of your

368
00:10:54,306 --> 0:10:55,226
strings files.

Next up. iPad apps for Mac, so

371
00:11:00,096 --> 0:11:02,066
you may be really excited about

372
00:11:02,066 --> 0:11:03,836
bringing your iPad apps to Mac,

373
00:11:04,646 --> 0:11:06,406
but maybe you have some strings

374
00:11:06,486 --> 0:11:08,546
that wouldn't make sense, and

375
00:11:08,546 --> 0:11:10,736
maybe something it says, tap

376
00:11:10,736 --> 0:11:12,266
here but the user would now be

377
00:11:12,266 --> 0:11:14,016
using a mouse with a cursor,

378
00:11:14,406 --> 0:11:16,476
maybe clicking, or here in news,

379
00:11:16,746 --> 0:11:18,356
you can control Siri's

380
00:11:18,396 --> 0:11:20,516
suggestions in Settings, if

381
00:11:20,516 --> 0:11:22,946
you're on the iPad, but that

382
00:11:22,946 --> 0:11:25,226
would be the apps preferences on

383
00:11:25,226 --> 0:11:25,586
a Mac.

384
00:11:26,256 --> 0:11:29,616
And, of course, you want to have

385
00:11:29,666 --> 0:11:32,656
that one NSLocalizedString

386
00:11:32,656 --> 0:11:34,526
called it's already in code.

387
00:11:35,506 --> 0:11:37,226
So, to help with this, we're

388
00:11:37,226 --> 0:11:39,466
introducing a new stringsdict

389
00:11:39,576 --> 0:11:41,356
rule for device-specific

390
00:11:41,526 --> 0:11:42,076
strings.

391
00:11:43,346 --> 0:11:45,266
And this rule can be combined

392
00:11:45,446 --> 0:11:47,106
with the plural and variable

393
00:11:47,106 --> 0:11:47,746
width rules.

394
00:11:47,746 --> 0:11:49,466
So, you can use this for any of

395
00:11:49,466 --> 0:11:51,546
your existing strings even if

396
00:11:51,546 --> 0:11:53,466
they're already in a stringsdict

397
00:11:53,466 --> 0:11:53,886
file.

398
00:11:56,146 --> 0:11:57,256
So, the new rule is

399
00:11:57,306 --> 0:11:59,476
NSStringDeviceSpecificRuleType

400
00:11:59,986 --> 0:12:01,556
and the supported device keys

401
00:11:59,986 --> 0:12:01,556
and the supported device keys

402
00:12:02,426 --> 0:12:06,906
are apppletv, applewatch, ipad,

403
00:12:07,396 --> 0:12:10,476
iphone, ipod and mac.

404
00:12:10,836 --> 0:12:13,116
So, it's not just for iPad apps

405
00:12:13,456 --> 0:12:14,746
on Mac.

406
00:12:15,276 --> 0:12:16,816
And your stringsdict will look

407
00:12:16,816 --> 0:12:18,706
something like this, at the top,

408
00:12:19,196 --> 0:12:22,026
your existing string key then

409
00:12:22,026 --> 0:12:22,756
the new rule

410
00:12:22,986 --> 0:12:25,126
NSStringDeviceSpecificRuleType

411
00:12:25,576 --> 0:12:27,836
and inside a dictionary, with

412
00:12:27,836 --> 0:12:29,536
all of your device specific

413
00:12:29,536 --> 0:12:32,046
strings index by those device

414
00:12:32,046 --> 0:12:32,326
keys.

415
00:12:33,326 --> 0:12:35,266

please check out the session

417
00:12:36,866 --> 0:12:38,456
Taking iPad Apps For Mac to the

419
00:12:40,406 --> 0:12:43,236
Next up. Settings bundle.

420
00:12:43,616 --> 0:12:46,386
Settings Bundles are now

421
00:12:46,386 --> 0:12:47,816
included in your Xcode

422
00:12:47,816 --> 0:12:48,976
Localization Catalogs.

423
00:12:49,426 --> 0:12:51,506
So these are as easy to localize

424
00:12:51,596 --> 0:12:52,856
as anything else in your

425
00:12:52,856 --> 0:12:53,296
project.

426
00:12:54,306 --> 0:12:56,316
And one of the more significant

427
00:12:56,316 --> 0:12:58,036
improvements we made to the

428
00:12:58,036 --> 0:13:00,696
localization tooling in Xcode is

429
00:12:58,036 --> 0:13:00,696
localization tooling in Xcode is

430
00:13:00,696 --> 0:13:03,586
in how you localize Assets.

431
00:13:04,406 --> 0:13:06,196
So until now, in order to

432
00:13:06,196 --> 0:13:08,046
localize an image it needed to

433
00:13:08,046 --> 0:13:10,536
be an independent file in your

434
00:13:10,726 --> 0:13:13,156
project and this may have meant

435
00:13:13,156 --> 0:13:16,266
you had some files in your Asset

436
00:13:16,266 --> 0:13:18,506
Catalog and the localized ones

437
00:13:18,586 --> 0:13:19,766
floating around lose.

438
00:13:20,556 --> 0:13:22,056
So I'm very excited to announce

439
00:13:22,146 --> 0:13:23,626
that starting now you can

440
00:13:23,626 --> 0:13:26,086
localize images directly in your

441
00:13:26,206 --> 0:13:26,886
Asset Catalog.

442
00:13:27,516 --> 0:13:30,896
[ Applause ]

443
00:13:31,396 --> 0:13:33,546
So, this means you can now

444
00:13:33,546 --> 0:13:37,486
localize your image sets, watch

445
00:13:37,486 --> 0:13:40,506
complications, Apple TV image

446
00:13:40,506 --> 0:13:44,726
stacks, Sprite atlases, Game

447
00:13:44,726 --> 0:13:46,056
Center dashboards and

448
00:13:46,056 --> 0:13:48,966
leaderboards, as well as the new

449
00:13:49,176 --> 0:13:49,776
symbol sets.

450
00:13:50,866 --> 0:13:52,056
So, let's take a look how you do

451
00:13:52,056 --> 0:13:52,276
that.

452
00:13:53,146 --> 0:13:56,156
In the Asset Catalog Editor when

453
00:13:56,156 --> 0:13:57,846
you select a supported type in

454
00:13:57,846 --> 0:14:00,076
the Attribute Inspector, you'll

455
00:13:57,846 --> 0:14:00,076
the Attribute Inspector, you'll

456
00:14:00,076 --> 0:14:02,016
now find a localized button.

457
00:14:02,296 --> 0:14:04,336
Click that and we add the

458
00:14:04,336 --> 0:14:05,736
localized of our attribute to

459
00:14:05,766 --> 0:14:07,566
the content so adjacent to that

460
00:14:07,636 --> 0:14:09,886
asset, you're ready to export an

461
00:14:09,886 --> 0:14:11,526
Xcode Localization Catalog.

462
00:14:12,926 --> 0:14:14,146
But, say that you're

463
00:14:14,146 --> 0:14:16,186
multilingual and doing some of

464
00:14:16,186 --> 0:14:17,976
the localization work yourself

465
00:14:18,456 --> 0:14:20,566
or maybe you're moving already

466
00:14:20,566 --> 0:14:23,046
localized images into the Asset

467
00:14:23,046 --> 0:14:25,306
Catalog, well, when you click

468
00:14:25,306 --> 0:14:26,946
that button, it's going to

469
00:14:26,946 --> 0:14:29,516
reveal check boxes with all of

470
00:14:29,516 --> 0:14:31,296
the localizations already in

471
00:14:31,296 --> 0:14:31,866
your project.

472
00:14:33,296 --> 0:14:36,156
Check any of those, and it will

473
00:14:36,156 --> 0:14:37,976
create the wells in the Asset

474
00:14:37,976 --> 0:14:39,816
Catalog Editor, so you can drag

475
00:14:39,816 --> 0:14:41,766
in the localized images like you

476
00:14:41,766 --> 0:14:43,506
would any other asset.

477
00:14:44,276 --> 0:14:45,676
Now, what about those new

478
00:14:45,676 --> 0:14:46,246
symbols?

479
00:14:47,186 --> 0:14:49,876
Well, SF system symbols are

480
00:14:49,876 --> 0:14:51,386
localized for you, you don't

481
00:14:51,386 --> 0:14:52,526
need to do any extra work.

482
00:14:53,876 --> 0:14:55,516
Custom symbols can also be

483
00:14:55,516 --> 0:14:56,126
localized.

484
00:14:56,696 --> 0:14:57,446
You can either set the

485
00:14:57,446 --> 0:14:59,246
directionality, if you just need

486
00:14:59,246 --> 0:15:00,696
them to flip for right-to-left

487
00:14:59,246 --> 0:15:00,696
them to flip for right-to-left

488
00:15:00,696 --> 0:15:01,856
languages like Arabic and

489
00:15:01,856 --> 0:15:04,256
Hebrew, or you can do a full

490
00:15:04,256 --> 0:15:06,276
localization cycle in the same

491
00:15:06,276 --> 0:15:07,766
workflow as images.

492
00:15:07,766 --> 0:15:09,406
You'll find the same localized

493
00:15:09,406 --> 0:15:10,566
button in the Attribute

494
00:15:10,566 --> 0:15:11,106
Inspector.

495
00:15:11,996 --> 0:15:13,506

00:15:13,506 --> 0:15:14,366
check out the session

Introducing SF Symbols later

498
00:15:16,436 --> 0:15:16,886
today.

499
00:15:18,136 --> 0:15:20,286
And with that I'd like to show

500
00:15:20,286 --> 0:15:21,646
you all this live in the demo.

501
00:15:22,516 --> 0:15:27,316
[ Applause ]

502
00:15:27,816 --> 0:15:29,386
Now, you may have notice in

503
00:15:29,386 --> 0:15:31,186
Kulpreet's demo that we had not

504
00:15:31,186 --> 0:15:32,426
localized the rest of these

505
00:15:32,426 --> 0:15:34,276
images, so I'm going to do that

506
00:15:34,276 --> 0:15:34,596
now.

507
00:15:34,996 --> 0:15:37,436
If I go into Xcode, I can go to

508
00:15:37,436 --> 0:15:39,436
my asset catalog and let's fix

509
00:15:39,436 --> 0:15:40,796
up this nice yoga image.

510
00:15:40,796 --> 0:15:43,486
It's a very nice yoga retreat on

511
00:15:43,486 --> 0:15:44,836
the moon where you can feel

512
00:15:44,836 --> 0:15:47,026
lighter, mentally and

513
00:15:47,026 --> 0:15:47,606
physically.

514
00:15:47,886 --> 0:15:50,216
So, I just go over to the

515
00:15:50,216 --> 0:15:52,996
Attribute Inspector, click

516
00:15:52,996 --> 0:15:56,346
localized, save, and that one is

517
00:15:56,346 --> 0:15:56,906
ready to go.

518
00:15:57,636 --> 0:15:59,076
I've already done this for my

519
00:15:59,076 --> 0:16:02,316
other vacation packages but I

520
00:15:59,076 --> 0:16:02,316
other vacation packages but I

521
00:16:02,446 --> 0:16:04,866
have one image that's already

522
00:16:04,866 --> 0:16:06,216
localized and I want to move

523
00:16:06,216 --> 0:16:08,406
into my Asset Catalog to take

524
00:16:08,406 --> 0:16:09,736
advantage of all the great

525
00:16:09,736 --> 0:16:11,946
features of Asset Catalogs like

526
00:16:11,946 --> 0:16:13,096
being able to specify a

527
00:16:13,136 --> 0:16:14,466
different appearance for Dark

528
00:16:14,466 --> 0:16:14,766
mode.

529
00:16:15,786 --> 0:16:17,716
This is super easy, I just grab

530
00:16:17,716 --> 0:16:19,656
my old image and drag in to the

531
00:16:19,656 --> 0:16:20,456
Asset Catalog.

532
00:16:21,756 --> 0:16:23,626
Xcode has created a new image

533
00:16:23,766 --> 0:16:26,786
set with the same name as my old

534
00:16:26,786 --> 0:16:27,326
resource.

535
00:16:27,956 --> 0:16:29,276
So I don't even need to go make

536
00:16:29,276 --> 0:16:30,966
a change in my storyboard, it

537
00:16:31,186 --> 0:16:31,986
will just work.

538
00:16:32,716 --> 0:16:33,806
Now, I want to bring my

539
00:16:33,916 --> 0:16:35,726
localizations along too, so I

540
00:16:35,726 --> 0:16:38,736
click localized, check off the

541
00:16:38,736 --> 0:16:40,756
existing language and I'll drag

542
00:16:40,756 --> 0:16:44,296
that one into place, and save.

543
00:16:45,006 --> 0:16:46,696
And I can just delete the old

544
00:16:46,696 --> 0:16:49,546
one, from my project and on

545
00:16:49,546 --> 0:16:49,826
disk.

546
00:16:50,736 --> 0:16:53,436
OK, so everything is ready.

547
00:16:53,436 --> 0:16:55,826
I can now export an Xcode

548
00:16:55,826 --> 0:16:56,906
Localization Catalog.

549
00:16:57,646 --> 0:16:59,226
This is the same workflow as

550
00:16:59,266 --> 0:16:59,876
Xcode 10.

551
00:17:00,786 --> 0:17:02,346
I select the project, go to

552
00:17:02,346 --> 0:17:04,955
Editor, export for localization.

553
00:17:08,226 --> 0:17:09,606
And let's just do French for

554
00:17:09,606 --> 0:17:10,986
now, I don't need the rest of

555
00:17:10,986 --> 0:17:11,205
these.

556
00:17:12,766 --> 0:17:14,195
OK, export.

557
00:17:15,806 --> 0:17:19,715
Let's see what we got.

558
00:17:19,935 --> 0:17:21,886
OK, here is my Xcode

559
00:17:21,886 --> 0:17:23,506
Localization Catalog and I can

560
00:17:23,506 --> 0:17:24,675
just send this off to my

561
00:17:24,675 --> 0:17:26,665
localizers and I'll find my

562
00:17:26,665 --> 0:17:27,336
localizer.

563
00:17:27,336 --> 0:17:29,966
I'm going to pop this open and I

564
00:17:29,966 --> 0:17:31,946
know I can dive right into

565
00:17:31,946 --> 0:17:33,896
Localize Contents and get to

566
00:17:33,896 --> 0:17:34,306
work.

567
00:17:34,946 --> 0:17:36,696
So, what do we got here, OK,

568
00:17:36,696 --> 0:17:38,706
here is the xliff, I know what

569
00:17:38,706 --> 0:17:40,006
to do with that, I know it has

570
00:17:40,006 --> 0:17:41,446
all the strings for the project

571
00:17:42,076 --> 0:17:43,236
but what else is here?

572
00:17:44,486 --> 0:17:46,306
OK, we have an Asset Catalog.

573
00:17:46,846 --> 0:17:49,526
And this is a fully formed Asset

574
00:17:49,526 --> 0:17:49,996
Catalog.

575
00:17:49,996 --> 0:17:51,456
I could go drag this into

576
00:17:51,456 --> 0:17:53,176
another Xcode project and use

577
00:17:53,176 --> 0:17:53,386
it.

578
00:17:53,916 --> 0:17:55,316
But this one has been filtered

579
00:17:55,316 --> 0:17:57,736
down to only what the localizer

580
00:17:57,836 --> 0:17:58,486
cares about.

581
00:17:58,896 --> 0:18:00,556
So, it's only the localizable

582
00:17:58,896 --> 0:18:00,556
So, it's only the localizable

583
00:18:00,556 --> 0:18:02,796
content and only for this

584
00:18:03,056 --> 0:18:03,666
locale.

585
00:18:04,906 --> 0:18:06,056
Now, in this case, we don't have

586
00:18:06,056 --> 0:18:08,506
any French images yet, so

587
00:18:08,696 --> 0:18:10,716
[inaudible] on here, it's just

588
00:18:10,716 --> 0:18:12,046
the copy of the English.

589
00:18:12,416 --> 0:18:13,586
This is for the convenience with

590
00:18:13,586 --> 0:18:14,306
the localizer.

591
00:18:14,306 --> 0:18:16,046
They can just jump in, start

592
00:18:16,046 --> 0:18:16,416
editing.

593
00:18:17,816 --> 0:18:19,126
Save time, I've had some

594
00:18:19,186 --> 0:18:20,916
localizers do exactly that for

595
00:18:20,916 --> 0:18:21,126
me.

596
00:18:21,186 --> 0:18:22,996
So, let's see what they sent

597
00:18:22,996 --> 0:18:23,246
back.

598
00:18:24,186 --> 0:18:25,546
Just go open the catalog in my

599
00:18:25,546 --> 0:18:27,126
favorite localization tool here.

600
00:18:27,866 --> 0:18:34,346
And we can see side-by-side the

601
00:18:34,606 --> 0:18:36,766
English and French versions of

602
00:18:36,766 --> 0:18:39,026
all images there is yoga, yup.

603
00:18:40,066 --> 0:18:42,546
OK. Let's import this into the

604
00:18:42,546 --> 0:18:45,216
project, go back to Xcode, again

605
00:18:45,606 --> 0:18:47,486
same workflow as Xcode 10,

606
00:18:47,526 --> 0:18:49,146
select the project, go to

607
00:18:49,146 --> 0:18:51,646
Editor, import localizations,

608
00:18:52,336 --> 0:18:53,866
select that finished Xcode

609
00:18:53,866 --> 0:18:56,316
Localization Catalog and click

610
00:18:56,376 --> 0:18:58,496
Import, great.

611
00:18:58,496 --> 0:18:59,686
So, now, I have to go to my

612
00:18:59,686 --> 0:19:04,686
asset catalog, I can see, I now

613
00:18:59,686 --> 0:19:04,686
asset catalog, I can see, I now

614
00:19:04,686 --> 0:19:07,486
have two versions of my image in

615
00:19:07,486 --> 0:19:08,956
here all in one place.

616
00:19:09,516 --> 0:19:11,866
[ Applause ]

617
00:19:12,366 --> 0:19:14,136
But, it's kind of small, so

618
00:19:14,136 --> 0:19:15,306
let's run the app again, so we

619
00:19:15,306 --> 0:19:16,366
can see that a little bigger.

620
00:19:20,046 --> 0:19:21,896
So, this time when we go back to

621
00:19:21,896 --> 0:19:24,146
the app, we should see all of

622
00:19:24,146 --> 0:19:27,166
our vacation packages now with

623
00:19:27,226 --> 0:19:28,076
the French titles.

624
00:19:33,016 --> 0:19:35,496
There we go, beautiful.

625
00:19:36,516 --> 0:19:41,176
[ Applause ]

626
00:19:41,676 --> 0:19:44,976
OK. Let's go back to the slides.

627
00:19:48,646 --> 0:19:49,746
So, we just saw some of the

628
00:19:49,746 --> 0:19:51,426
enhancements to localization

629
00:19:51,426 --> 0:19:52,726
tooling in Xcode.

630
00:19:53,436 --> 0:19:55,176
Export and import of interface

631
00:19:55,176 --> 0:19:57,026
Builder files is now a lot

632
00:19:57,106 --> 0:19:57,536
faster.

633
00:19:59,036 --> 0:20:00,356
There's a new stringsdict rule

634
00:19:59,036 --> 0:20:00,356
There's a new stringsdict rule

635
00:20:00,356 --> 0:20:03,816
for device-specific strings.

636
00:20:04,086 --> 0:20:05,566
Settings Bundle is now easy to

637
00:20:05,566 --> 0:20:06,146
localize.

638
00:20:06,996 --> 0:20:09,766
And symbols and images are

639
00:20:09,766 --> 0:20:11,806
localizable in Asset Catalogs.

640
00:20:12,686 --> 0:20:13,786
Now, of course, once you've

641
00:20:13,786 --> 0:20:15,656
localize your app you're going

642
00:20:15,656 --> 0:20:17,326
to want to test all of those

643
00:20:17,326 --> 0:20:18,326
localizations.

644
00:20:19,006 --> 0:20:20,566
And we've made that easier too.

645
00:20:20,566 --> 0:20:22,666
And I'd like to call up Arthur

646
00:20:22,986 --> 0:20:23,946
to tell you all about it.

647
00:20:24,516 --> 0:20:27,276
[Applause]

648
00:20:27,776 --> 0:20:29,976
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Vivian.

649
00:20:31,046 --> 0:20:32,216
Now, let's take a look at how

650
00:20:32,216 --> 0:20:33,926
you can take advantage of UI

651
00:20:33,926 --> 0:20:35,086
testing for localization.

652
00:20:36,466 --> 0:20:38,246
Testing is a significant part of

653
00:20:38,246 --> 0:20:39,226
any development cycle.

654
00:20:39,716 --> 0:20:41,976
It takes time and resources but

655
00:20:41,976 --> 0:20:43,066
it's very important to help

656
00:20:43,096 --> 0:20:44,586
catch regressions as you add new

657
00:20:44,586 --> 0:20:46,836
features and detect bugs before

658
00:20:46,836 --> 0:20:48,316
you release your product to your

659
00:20:48,316 --> 0:20:48,726
customers.

660
00:20:51,376 --> 0:20:52,826
If your app support more than

661
00:20:52,826 --> 0:20:54,496
one language you will have to

662
00:20:54,496 --> 0:20:55,716
test full language specific

663
00:20:55,716 --> 0:20:56,036
issues.

664
00:20:56,866 --> 0:21:00,586
Clip strings, truncated content,

665
00:20:56,866 --> 0:21:00,586
Clip strings, truncated content,

666
00:21:01,396 --> 0:21:04,186
overlapping layouts or even

667
00:21:04,186 --> 0:21:05,586
issues specific to right-to-left

668
00:21:05,586 --> 0:21:06,866
languages such as Hebrew,

669
00:21:06,866 --> 0:21:07,186
Arabic.

670
00:21:09,696 --> 0:21:12,106
Now, if you want to test for

671
00:21:12,106 --> 0:21:15,386
every device you support, in

672
00:21:15,586 --> 0:21:18,566
every language you support, your

673
00:21:18,566 --> 0:21:19,956
test metrics can repeat and

674
00:21:19,956 --> 0:21:20,256
explore.

675
00:21:21,836 --> 0:21:23,636
You can easily end up with

676
00:21:23,726 --> 0:21:24,616
thousands of different

677
00:21:24,616 --> 0:21:24,956
scenarios.

678
00:21:26,236 --> 0:21:27,166
And that will make it really

679
00:21:27,166 --> 0:21:28,586
difficult for your testers to

680
00:21:28,586 --> 0:21:29,626
cover all these scenarios

681
00:21:29,626 --> 0:21:29,936
manually.

682
00:21:30,446 --> 0:21:32,136
So, it's even more important to

683
00:21:32,136 --> 0:21:34,016
include test in your project to

684
00:21:34,016 --> 0:21:35,146
help produce manual work load

685
00:21:35,206 --> 0:21:36,496
for your QA.

686
00:21:37,736 --> 0:21:40,936
In Xcode 11, we made it easier

687
00:21:40,936 --> 0:21:42,686
for you to cover all of this

688
00:21:42,686 --> 0:21:44,196
test automatically with test

689
00:21:44,706 --> 0:21:44,976
plans.

[ Applause ]

691
00:21:49,706 --> 0:21:51,316
Test plan is a very easy way to

692
00:21:51,316 --> 0:21:53,126
run the same tests multiple

693
00:21:53,126 --> 0:21:54,546
times using different

694
00:21:54,546 --> 0:21:55,176
configurations.

695
00:21:56,386 --> 0:21:57,456
I'm not going to go too much

696
00:21:57,456 --> 0:21:58,616
into details about test plans

697
00:21:58,616 --> 0:21:58,866
today.

698
00:21:58,956 --> 0:22:00,576
So please check out the Testing

699

So please check out the Testing

700
00:22:00,576 --> 0:22:01,866
in Xcode session on Thursday

701
00:22:01,866 --> 0:22:04,136
morning to learn more about it.

702
00:22:04,956 --> 0:22:06,616
What we will be covering is how

703
00:22:06,666 --> 0:22:08,726
you can use test plans in your

704
00:22:08,726 --> 0:22:10,546
localization workflow.

705
00:22:11,896 --> 0:22:14,526
So, first, we will see how you

706
00:22:14,526 --> 0:22:15,616
can make sure that your test

707
00:22:15,616 --> 0:22:18,916
localization friendly, then

708
00:22:19,406 --> 0:22:20,466
we'll talk about how you can use

709
00:22:20,506 --> 0:22:22,466
test plans to generate localized

710
00:22:23,196 --> 0:22:23,476
screenshots.

711
00:22:24,276 --> 0:22:26,256
And, finally, we will go over

712
00:22:26,256 --> 0:22:27,806
some of the many use cases for

713
00:22:27,806 --> 0:22:29,376
those screenshots, because

714
00:22:29,376 --> 0:22:30,566
they're not only good for

715
00:22:31,496 --> 0:22:31,686
testing.

716
00:22:33,506 --> 0:22:36,316
First, let's see how we can make

717
00:22:36,316 --> 0:22:37,876
sure that your test can work in

718
00:22:37,876 --> 0:22:38,916
every language you run them in.

719
00:22:40,416 --> 0:22:43,026
To do so, you should rely on

720
00:22:43,026 --> 0:22:44,236
Accessibility Identifiers.

721
00:22:45,536 --> 0:22:47,056
These identifiers are unique,

722
00:22:47,646 --> 0:22:49,856
stable, and we'll guarantee that

723
00:22:49,856 --> 0:22:51,236
your test can run in any

724
00:22:51,236 --> 0:22:51,626
language.

725
00:22:53,626 --> 0:22:55,696
You can easily set them up,

726
00:22:55,766 --> 0:22:56,776
setting the property of the same

727
00:22:56,776 --> 0:22:59,796
name in code or if you're using

728
00:22:59,866 --> 0:23:01,246
interface Builder to create your

729
00:22:59,866 --> 0:23:01,246
interface Builder to create your

730
00:23:01,246 --> 0:23:03,626
UI element, you can define them

731
00:23:03,626 --> 0:23:04,796
right there in the Identity

732
00:23:04,796 --> 0:23:08,966
Inspector, and that's all it

733
00:23:08,966 --> 0:23:09,336
takes.

734
00:23:09,696 --> 0:23:10,626
So, now, that your test are

735
00:23:10,626 --> 0:23:12,656
localization friendly, let's see

736
00:23:12,656 --> 0:23:13,826
how we can use them to Generate

737
00:23:13,826 --> 0:23:14,606
Localized Screenshots.

738
00:23:16,716 --> 0:23:18,576
As I mentioned earlier in your

739
00:23:18,576 --> 0:23:20,376
test plan you can create

740
00:23:20,376 --> 0:23:21,486
multiple configuration.

741
00:23:24,596 --> 0:23:26,116
In each of this configuration

742
00:23:27,096 --> 0:23:28,396
you can set a different language

743
00:23:28,486 --> 0:23:29,886
and a different region to run

744
00:23:29,886 --> 0:23:30,346
your testing.

745
00:23:33,436 --> 0:23:35,886
Then by simply turning on the

746
00:23:35,886 --> 0:23:37,396
Localization Screenshots option

747
00:23:37,556 --> 0:23:40,096
in the UI testing section, your

748
00:23:40,096 --> 0:23:41,626
screenshots will be persisted

749
00:23:42,456 --> 0:23:43,886
and there's so much you can do

750
00:23:44,666 --> 0:23:46,086
with them.

751
00:23:46,306 --> 0:23:47,136
Well, some of this option

752
00:23:47,136 --> 0:23:48,486
available in the Scheme Editor

753
00:23:48,856 --> 0:23:49,996
that we already-- you already

754
00:23:49,996 --> 0:23:51,376
know and use in case you haven't

755
00:23:51,376 --> 0:23:56,566
market it to test plans yet.

756
00:23:56,566 --> 0:23:57,926
And now that your tests are set

757
00:23:57,926 --> 0:23:58,696
up to capture Localized

758
00:23:58,696 --> 0:24:00,336
Screenshots, let's see what we

759
00:23:58,696 --> 0:24:00,336
Screenshots, let's see what we

760
00:24:00,336 --> 0:24:00,886
can do with them.

761
00:24:01,726 --> 0:24:02,526
They're actually a great

762
00:24:02,566 --> 0:24:03,396
marketing resource.

763
00:24:04,026 --> 0:24:05,286
You can pass them along to your

764
00:24:05,286 --> 0:24:07,516
marketing team or even upload

765
00:24:07,516 --> 0:24:08,966
them to the App Store to

766
00:24:09,036 --> 0:24:11,396
showcase your latest design.

767
00:24:11,556 --> 0:24:12,626
You can use them in your

768
00:24:12,626 --> 0:24:14,096
documentation or in your

769
00:24:14,096 --> 0:24:14,526
tutorials.

770
00:24:17,156 --> 0:24:19,706
But more importantly they can

771
00:24:19,706 --> 0:24:21,296
help your localizers get the

772
00:24:21,296 --> 0:24:23,106
context they need to provide you

773
00:24:23,106 --> 0:24:24,696
with high quality localization.

774
00:24:25,326 --> 0:24:27,656
Let's take a quick example.

775
00:24:28,446 --> 0:24:31,596
A simple word like Start in

776
00:24:31,596 --> 0:24:33,616
English could either be a verb

777
00:24:33,886 --> 0:24:36,426
meaning to begin or it could be

778
00:24:36,426 --> 0:24:37,736
a noun and referred to the

779
00:24:37,736 --> 0:24:38,526
beginning of an event.

780
00:24:39,656 --> 0:24:41,066
While this difference might seem

781
00:24:41,066 --> 0:24:42,546
really subtle in English, it can

782
00:24:42,546 --> 0:24:43,676

localizations in other

languages.

785
00:24:46,716 --> 0:24:48,586
Here, we can see it's a noun

786
00:24:48,586 --> 0:24:49,526
because it's labeling the

787
00:24:49,596 --> 0:24:50,886
starting date.

788
00:24:51,936 --> 0:24:53,776
Giving this visual context to

789
00:24:53,776 --> 0:24:55,536
your localizers we'll alleviate

790
00:24:55,536 --> 0:24:57,096
the ambiguity and make sure that

791
00:24:57,136 --> 0:24:58,146
you get the most accurate

792
00:24:58,146 --> 0:24:58,756
localization.

793
00:25:01,056 --> 0:25:03,706
Last year, we introduced the

794
00:25:03,706 --> 0:25:04,836
Xcode Localization Catalog.

795
00:25:06,466 --> 0:25:08,226
It's a very common way to handle

796
00:25:08,226 --> 0:25:10,446
localizing both strings and

797
00:25:10,446 --> 0:25:12,786
non-string based resources all

798
00:25:12,786 --> 0:25:14,556
in one place.

799
00:25:15,716 --> 0:25:17,696
In it we included the Notes

800
00:25:17,696 --> 0:25:19,546
directory, specifically for you

801
00:25:19,546 --> 0:25:20,636
to include contextual

00:25:20,636 --> 0:25:22,346
information such as screenshots

803
00:25:22,606 --> 0:25:25,206
for your localizers.

804
00:25:26,066 --> 0:25:28,366
This year, I'm very happy to say

805
00:25:28,576 --> 0:25:29,646
that we are automatically

806
00:25:29,646 --> 0:25:30,906
including these screenshots for

If you rely on automation to

00:25:48,376 --> 0:25:49,296
generate your Localization

816
00:25:49,296 --> 0:25:51,186

818
00:25:52,656 --> 0:25:53,466

00:25:55,396 --> 0:25:58,546
You can also customize which

821
00:25:58,546 --> 0:25:59,446
screenshots I exported.

822
00:26:00,066 --> 0:26:01,276
We made it easier for you to

823
00:26:01,276 --> 0:26:03,126
specify which test targets,

824
00:26:03,336 --> 0:26:05,676

to Localization Catalog.

826
00:26:10,136 --> 0:26:11,396
But that might be a lot of

827
00:26:11,396 --> 0:26:13,056
screenshots for your localizers

828
00:26:13,056 --> 0:26:14,986
to come through to see exactly

00:26:14,986 --> 0:26:16,466
what Strings shows on the UI.

830
00:26:17,696 --> 0:26:20,186
So, alongside every Localized

831
00:26:20,186 --> 0:26:21,976
Screenshot that we generate, we

832
00:26:21,976 --> 0:26:23,466
also generate a metadata.plist,

833
00:26:23,836 --> 0:26:25,626
mapping the strings to the exact

834
00:26:25,626 --> 0:26:26,976
location on the screenshots.

835
00:26:29,656 --> 0:26:31,166
This plist include the strings

836
00:26:31,166 --> 0:26:32,996
IDs, the ones that you can find

837
00:26:32,996 --> 0:26:35,196
in the Eclipse but also the

838
00:26:35,196 --> 0:26:37,286
framing formation, which is the

839
00:26:37,286 --> 0:26:39,256
exact location of the Strings on

840
00:26:39,256 --> 0:26:39,726
the screenshots.

841
00:26:41,276 --> 0:26:42,836
This makes it really easy for

842
00:26:42,836 --> 0:26:44,276
localization tools to map the

843
00:26:44,276 --> 0:26:46,336
Strings to the Eclipse and

844
00:26:46,336 --> 0:26:48,186
highlight them directly on the

846
00:26:50,196 --> 0:26:51,506
And once you export your

847
00:26:51,506 --> 0:26:53,576

848
00:26:53,576 --> 0:26:55,256

862
00:27:22,586 --> 0:27:25,156
So, now that we've localized our

863
00:27:25,156 --> 0:27:26,826
app, we want to test those

864
00:27:26,826 --> 0:27:27,806
Localizations.

865
00:27:33,136 --> 0:27:33,906
All right.

866
00:27:34,706 --> 0:27:36,856
So, I've already created some UI

867
00:27:36,856 --> 0:27:38,606
tests for my project here.

868
00:27:39,136 --> 0:27:41,576
I have some here that will

869
00:27:41,576 --> 0:27:44,576
capture all of my screens, which

870
00:27:44,716 --> 0:27:46,206
I think would be really helpful

871
00:27:46,206 --> 0:27:48,226
for giving to my localizers for

872
00:27:48,226 --> 0:27:48,686
context.

873
00:27:48,686 --> 0:27:51,556
And I have another test that

874
00:27:51,556 --> 0:27:53,216
just zips in there and gets a

875
00:27:53,256 --> 0:27:55,286
picture of those nice vacation

876
00:27:55,286 --> 0:27:56,676
package images, which I think

877
00:27:56,676 --> 0:27:57,806
would be good for marketing.

878
00:27:58,746 --> 0:28:00,556
But I want to run all of these

879
00:27:58,746 --> 0:28:00,556
But I want to run all of these

00:28:03,306 --> 0:28:03,816
support.

882
00:28:03,816 --> 0:28:05,756
And that could take some time

883
00:28:06,036 --> 0:28:07,496
which is where test plans comes

884
00:28:07,496 --> 0:28:07,976
in handy.

885
00:28:07,976 --> 0:28:09,466
So you can add a test plan to

00:28:10,816 --> 0:28:11,196

889
00:28:14,306 --> 0:28:15,776

search for plan.

There it is.

00:28:19,636 --> 0:28:21,816
existing test to test plans.

00:28:33,396 --> 0:28:36,786

901
00:28:36,866 --> 0:28:37,996
that's just going to capture

00:28:40,816 --> 0:28:42,276

another for Swedish, Sweden.

912

So, since I've just got those

00:28:58,816 --> 0:29:00,496
So, since I've just got those

914
00:29:00,496 --> 0:29:02,046

915
00:29:02,046 --> 0:29:03,336
add one for French.

France.

919
00:29:09,226 --> 0:29:14,266
OK. And we will set the

920
00:29:14,446 --> 0:29:17,586
application language to French

921
00:29:18,206 --> 0:29:20,806
and the application region to

France.

923
00:29:23,246 --> 0:29:25,506
OK. It's now-- I think, I'll

924
00:29:25,506 --> 0:29:27,506
rerun just the test to get that

925
00:29:27,506 --> 0:29:28,336
marketing image.

926
00:29:28,336 --> 0:29:29,846
So, I can get a picture of those

927
00:29:29,846 --> 0:29:31,836
newly localized French images.

928
00:29:32,486 --> 0:29:35,556
So, I go back to my UI test in

929
00:29:35,556 --> 0:29:36,146
order to run it.

930
00:29:36,616 --> 0:29:37,816
And now, when I click the test

931
00:29:37,856 --> 0:29:40,346
diamond, instead of running my

932
00:29:40,346 --> 0:29:42,436
test once, it's going to run it

933
00:29:42,806 --> 0:29:44,426
with all of my configurations

934
00:29:44,466 --> 0:29:45,666
and we can actually watch as it

935
00:29:45,666 --> 0:29:46,606
goes through all of this.

936
00:29:47,576 --> 0:29:49,196
So, it's going to run three

937
00:29:49,196 --> 0:29:53,696
times, English and then Swedish

938
00:29:54,196 --> 0:29:55,696
except my localizers aren't

939
00:29:55,696 --> 0:29:55,936
done.

940
00:29:55,936 --> 0:29:56,996
So, we'll probably going to see

941
00:29:57,056 --> 0:29:58,756
some English strings again and

942
00:29:58,756 --> 0:30:00,556
then one last time in French.

943
00:29:58,756 --> 0:30:00,556
then one last time in French.

944
00:30:02,066 --> 0:30:03,436
And I know that this will work

945
00:30:03,436 --> 0:30:05,436
because I use accessibility

946
00:30:05,436 --> 0:30:07,056
identifiers like Arthur said.

947
00:30:07,166 --> 0:30:08,896
So my test will work with all

948
00:30:09,006 --> 0:30:10,526
three language configurations.

949
00:30:11,756 --> 0:30:12,686
All right.

950
00:30:12,686 --> 0:30:16,626

954
00:30:24,516 --> 0:30:25,106
just ran.

955
00:30:25,106 --> 0:30:28,236
OK. I can see it run, it's on my

956
00:30:28,236 --> 0:30:30,026
configurations and if I check

957
00:30:30,026 --> 0:30:32,296
out French and look at my

958
00:30:32,296 --> 0:30:32,956

00:30:39,756 --> 0:30:41,266
for an update on Swedish that

964
00:30:41,266 --> 0:30:42,386
they can finish that.

965
00:30:42,856 --> 0:30:45,206
So I need to send them a fresh

967
00:30:48,096 --> 0:30:49,556
want to make sure that they get

968
00:30:49,556 --> 0:30:51,636
that really tricky start string,

969
00:30:51,636 --> 0:30:51,956
right.

970
00:30:52,146 --> 0:30:53,706
So, let's make sure they get a

971
00:30:53,706 --> 0:30:54,246
screenshot.

972
00:30:54,776 --> 0:30:57,576
I ran my test earlier for it to

973
00:30:57,576 --> 0:30:58,906
capture all of my screens.

974
00:31:00,126 --> 0:31:01,376
So, if I look at the Swedish

975
00:31:01,376 --> 0:31:05,236
one-- let's see if we can find

976
00:31:05,236 --> 0:31:07,086
that tricky start string.

977
00:31:07,086 --> 0:31:09,366
I think it's down here.

00:31:10,336 --> 0:31:11,006
Yeah. There we go.

979
00:31:11,006 --> 0:31:12,216
OK. So they haven't translated

980
00:31:12,216 --> 0:31:14,396
Start yet or End and they got

981
00:31:14,806 --> 0:31:15,276
Travelers.

982
00:31:16,136 --> 0:31:19,936
And also in here I have that

983
00:31:20,086 --> 0:31:22,836
plist with the frame information

984
00:31:23,266 --> 0:31:24,336
which should be useful.

985
00:31:25,806 --> 0:31:28,366
So, I'm now ready to export an

986
00:31:28,366 --> 0:31:29,626
Xcode Localization Catalog.

987
00:31:30,406 --> 0:31:32,066
Select the project, go to

988
00:31:32,066 --> 0:31:34,566
Editor, export localization.

989
00:31:34,566 --> 0:31:37,596
And this time, I'm going to do

990
00:31:37,756 --> 0:31:41,226
Swedish and importantly I'm

991
00:31:41,226 --> 0:31:42,946
going to click Include

992
00:31:42,986 --> 0:31:43,696
screenshots.

993
00:31:44,496 --> 0:31:45,346
All right.

994
00:31:45,346 --> 0:31:46,996
Xcode has found I have 19

995
00:31:46,996 --> 0:31:47,986
screenshots available.

996
00:31:47,986 --> 0:31:49,226
Let's see exactly what I have

997
00:31:49,226 --> 0:31:49,526
here.

998
00:31:49,526 --> 0:31:51,796
If I click customize, I can see

999
00:31:52,476 --> 0:31:54,776
I ran my test with iPhone 8

1000
00:31:54,886 --> 0:31:56,966
Plus, 10R and 10S.

1001
00:31:56,966 --> 0:31:59,176
So, if there's any layout issues

1002
00:31:59,256 --> 0:32:01,576
that might catch some of those.

1003
00:31:59,256 --> 0:32:01,576
that might catch some of those.

1004
00:32:01,576 --> 0:32:02,466
OK. I'm definitely going to keep

1005
00:32:02,466 --> 0:32:03,196
all of those.

1006
00:32:04,776 --> 0:32:08,616
And, now, I'm ready to export.

1007
00:32:09,316 --> 0:32:16,276
OK. So, now, if I look at my new

1008
00:32:16,276 --> 0:32:20,316
Localization Catalog, now in the

1009
00:32:20,316 --> 0:32:22,176
Notes directory I have

1010
00:32:22,586 --> 0:32:23,286
screenshots.

1011
00:32:24,396 --> 0:32:26,106
And here I can see I have all of

1012
00:32:26,106 --> 0:32:28,546
my screenshots organized by test

1013
00:32:28,806 --> 0:32:30,206
target and device.

1014
00:32:30,936 --> 0:32:31,916
So, actually, I'm going to pull

1015
00:32:31,916 --> 0:32:33,866
the marketing ones out for later

1016
00:32:34,576 --> 0:32:36,606
and just send the rest to my

1017
00:32:36,606 --> 0:32:37,316
Localizers.

1018
00:32:38,046 --> 0:32:41,626
So we look in here, we can see I

1019
00:32:41,626 --> 0:32:44,506
have all of my screenshots.

1020
00:32:45,236 --> 0:32:48,976
OK. There's that tricky start

1021
00:32:48,976 --> 0:32:50,746
string and actually worst than

1022
00:32:50,866 --> 0:32:53,146
Start, you can see in this one

1023
00:32:53,146 --> 0:32:54,416
screenshot, we have the string

1024
00:32:54,416 --> 0:32:58,346
Book, one, two, three times.

1025
00:32:59,166 --> 0:33:03,896
So that plist with the frame

1026
00:32:59,166 --> 0:33:03,896
So that plist with the frame

1027
00:33:03,896 --> 0:33:05,036
informations can be really

1028
00:33:05,036 --> 0:33:05,526
useful.

1029
00:33:05,856 --> 0:33:07,566
And this is the consolidated

1030
00:33:07,566 --> 0:33:09,116
plist, so it has the frame

1031
00:33:09,116 --> 0:33:10,916
information for all of the

1032
00:33:10,916 --> 0:33:13,256
strings captured in this entire

1033
00:33:13,256 --> 0:33:15,076
set of screenshots.

1034
00:33:15,856 --> 0:33:18,056
So, they're really handy because

1035
00:33:18,456 --> 0:33:20,356
now when I'm on localizer I can

1036
00:33:20,356 --> 0:33:22,246
open the catalog in my favorite

1037
00:33:22,246 --> 0:33:23,326
Localization Tool.

1038
00:33:23,326 --> 0:33:29,386
And now, I can preview where

1039
00:33:29,386 --> 0:33:30,406
string shows up.

[ Applause ]

1041
00:33:35,716 --> 0:33:38,066
And not only can I see one place

1042
00:33:38,276 --> 0:33:40,296
where a string shows, it will

1043
00:33:40,296 --> 0:33:42,586
show me all of the screenshots

1044
00:33:42,586 --> 0:33:43,846
that capture the given string.

1045
00:33:46,576 --> 0:33:48,006
So, my localizers are going to

1046
00:33:48,006 --> 0:33:48,716
be thrilled.

1047
00:33:52,036 --> 0:33:53,506
All right, let's wrap things up.

1048
00:33:55,736 --> 0:33:59,386
So, today, we saw how users can

1049
00:33:59,386 --> 0:34:01,146
run your app in a different

1050
00:33:59,386 --> 0:34:01,146
run your app in a different

1051
00:34:01,146 --> 0:34:02,666
language to their system

1052
00:34:02,666 --> 0:34:03,236
language.

1053
00:34:04,156 --> 0:34:05,856
We saw a bunch of improvements

1054
00:34:06,536 --> 0:34:08,186
to the localization tooling in

1055
00:34:08,186 --> 0:34:11,596
Xcode, including faster export

1056
00:34:11,596 --> 0:34:13,376
of interface Builder files, a

1057
00:34:13,376 --> 0:34:15,676
new stringsdict rule, how easy

1058
00:34:15,676 --> 0:34:17,206
it is to localize your settings

1059
00:34:17,246 --> 0:34:18,716
bundle, and of course how you

1060
00:34:19,346 --> 0:34:21,456
can now localize images right in

1061
00:34:21,456 --> 0:34:22,466
your Asset Catalog.

1062
00:34:23,366 --> 0:34:26,446
We also saw how you can generate

1063
00:34:26,446 --> 0:34:28,846
Localized screenshots with your

1064
00:34:28,846 --> 0:34:31,746
Tests and some of the uses for

1065
00:34:31,916 --> 0:34:33,456
those screenshots.
