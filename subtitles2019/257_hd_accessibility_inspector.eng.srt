1
00:00:15,106 --> 0:00:15,956
&gt;&gt; Good morning everyone.

2
00:00:16,896 --> 0:00:18,636
My name is Gary and I am an

3
00:00:18,636 --> 0:00:20,216
engineer on the Accessibility

4
00:00:20,216 --> 0:00:20,416
Team.

5
00:00:21,246 --> 0:00:23,426
Today, I'm excited to talk about

6
00:00:23,996 --> 0:00:25,876
a tool called Accessibility

7
00:00:25,916 --> 0:00:26,416
Inspector.

8
00:00:31,666 --> 0:00:33,156
The Accessibility Inspector

9
00:00:33,156 --> 0:00:35,306
provides an easy way to find,

10
00:00:35,876 --> 0:00:38,296
diagnose, and fix accessibility

11
00:00:38,296 --> 0:00:39,746
issues within your app.

12
00:00:40,636 --> 0:00:42,786
In this presentation, we will be

13
00:00:42,786 --> 0:00:44,256
doing exactly that, using a

14
00:00:44,296 --> 0:00:44,816
sample app.

15
00:00:45,386 --> 0:00:46,286
Let's jump right into it.

16
00:00:52,316 --> 0:00:53,996
So here this is my Peanut Butter

17
00:00:53,996 --> 0:00:54,586
Tracking App.

18
00:00:55,266 --> 0:00:56,446
It helps my fellow peanut butter

19
00:00:56,446 --> 0:00:56,896
lovers.

20
00:00:57,216 --> 0:00:59,186
Tracks their favor brand, rate,

21
00:00:59,186 --> 0:01:00,946
them and record details about

22
00:00:59,186 --> 0:01:00,946
them and record details about

23
00:01:00,946 --> 0:01:01,126
them.

24
00:01:01,806 --> 0:01:03,216
Tapping on the particular cell

25
00:01:03,456 --> 0:01:04,885
will bring me to the Detail View

26
00:01:04,885 --> 0:01:05,986
for that particular brand.

27
00:01:05,986 --> 0:01:08,996
And in here, I can take photos

28
00:01:09,086 --> 0:01:10,426
of my favorite peanut butter.

29
00:01:11,386 --> 0:01:13,966
I could favorite it or I could

30
00:01:13,966 --> 0:01:15,146
buy it again and share with my

31
00:01:15,146 --> 0:01:15,436
friends.

32
00:01:16,876 --> 0:01:17,856
Now I want to test for

33
00:01:17,856 --> 0:01:19,366
accessibility issues from my

34
00:01:19,446 --> 0:01:21,366
Detailed View but I'm not quite

35
00:01:21,366 --> 0:01:22,336
sure where to start.

36
00:01:22,456 --> 0:01:24,956
The Accessibility Inspector

37
00:01:24,956 --> 0:01:26,556
makes this daunting task easy.

38
00:01:27,536 --> 0:01:28,466
Let's start by opening the

39
00:01:28,466 --> 0:01:29,236
Accessibility Inspector.

40
00:01:30,426 --> 0:01:33,026
So first, I'll go over to XCode

41
00:01:34,116 --> 0:01:36,156
and under the XCode Menu you'll

42
00:01:36,156 --> 0:01:38,016
see Open Developer Tools.

43
00:01:39,546 --> 0:01:41,696
And in here, you can find the

44
00:01:41,696 --> 0:01:42,556
Accessibility Inspector.

45
00:01:43,936 --> 0:01:45,296
You might notice what seems to

46
00:01:45,296 --> 0:01:45,856
be a large tooltip.

47
00:01:46,836 --> 0:01:48,426
This is actually a new feature

48
00:01:48,516 --> 0:01:49,916
that we added for low vision

49
00:01:49,916 --> 0:01:50,856
user on the Mac.

50
00:01:50,996 --> 0:01:53,516
It is called Hover Text and it

51
00:01:53,516 --> 0:01:55,006
makes anything under the mouse

52
00:01:55,046 --> 0:01:56,866
cursor larger and sharper to

53
00:01:56,866 --> 0:01:57,106
see.

54
00:01:58,006 --> 0:01:58,986
And we'll be using it throughout

55
00:01:58,986 --> 0:01:59,566
our demo today.

56
00:02:00,516 --> 0:02:07,626
[ Applause ]

57
00:02:08,126 --> 0:02:09,936
So now with Inspector open, I'm

58
00:02:09,936 --> 0:02:11,015
going to use the Target

59
00:02:11,076 --> 0:02:13,086
Selection Drop Down to select my

60
00:02:13,086 --> 0:02:13,596
iOS device.

61
00:02:14,336 --> 0:02:18,526
The Inspector has three main

62
00:02:18,526 --> 0:02:18,756
parts.

63
00:02:19,646 --> 0:02:22,336
First, the Inspector tab.

64
00:02:22,896 --> 0:02:24,906
Then the Audit tab.

65
00:02:24,906 --> 0:02:26,996
And the Settings tab.

66
00:02:26,996 --> 0:02:28,236
Let's focus on the Audit tab for

67
00:02:28,236 --> 0:02:28,426
now.

68
00:02:30,316 --> 0:02:32,156
This is one of the easiest ways

69
00:02:32,336 --> 0:02:33,686
to help me find accessibility

70
00:02:33,686 --> 0:02:35,256
issues in my app.

71
00:02:35,656 --> 0:02:37,066
By pressing on the Run Audit

72
00:02:37,066 --> 0:02:38,906
button, you'll get a list of

73
00:02:38,906 --> 0:02:40,636
potential accessibility issues.

74
00:02:41,426 --> 0:02:45,856
So let's try that for our view.

75
00:02:46,036 --> 0:02:47,586
Immediately, you see that it

76
00:02:47,656 --> 0:02:48,686
found a bunch of issues.

77
00:02:49,846 --> 0:02:51,366
And clicking on the issue will

78
00:02:51,366 --> 0:02:52,416
highlight the problematic

79
00:02:52,416 --> 0:02:53,296
element in yellow.

80
00:02:53,926 --> 0:02:57,276
Let's start in the middle with

81
00:02:57,276 --> 0:03:00,496
Image name used in description.

82
00:02:57,276 --> 0:03:00,496
Image name used in description.

83
00:03:00,496 --> 0:03:02,046
This issue seems to affect all

84
00:03:02,046 --> 0:03:03,016
three of our custom buttons.

85
00:03:03,526 --> 0:03:06,136
Assistive technologies like

86
00:03:06,136 --> 0:03:08,156
VoiceOver uses accessibility

87
00:03:08,156 --> 0:03:10,086
information such as a Label to

88
00:03:10,756 --> 0:03:13,176
help users interact and navigate

89
00:03:13,176 --> 0:03:14,656
with the UI in your view.

90
00:03:15,916 --> 0:03:17,366
But how exactly do we provide

91
00:03:17,366 --> 0:03:18,686
such information to the

92
00:03:18,686 --> 0:03:19,396
assisting technologies?

93
00:03:20,026 --> 0:03:22,456
You can click on the Help button

94
00:03:22,456 --> 0:03:24,236
on the right to get a suggestion

95
00:03:24,386 --> 0:03:27,596
for what to do.

96
00:03:27,846 --> 0:03:29,296
So here it states that consider

97
00:03:29,296 --> 0:03:30,736
setting a human readable,

98
00:03:31,066 --> 0:03:33,466
localized accessibilityLabel.

99
00:03:34,446 --> 0:03:36,026
Now let's head back to our

100
00:03:36,296 --> 0:03:39,516
Inspector tab.

101
00:03:39,856 --> 0:03:41,176
Now I want to inspect for my

102
00:03:41,176 --> 0:03:41,846
custom buttons.

103
00:03:42,786 --> 0:03:45,066
And to do that, you'll press the

104
00:03:45,066 --> 0:03:47,266
Point Inspection button on the

105
00:03:48,856 --> 0:03:48,966
top.

106
00:03:50,036 --> 0:03:51,656
Now with my fingers down on the

107
00:03:51,656 --> 0:03:54,876
screen, I can move around and

108
00:03:54,876 --> 0:03:56,796
focus on any accessible element.

109
00:03:57,646 --> 0:03:58,706
Let's start with the Custom

110
00:03:59,316 --> 0:03:59,466
button.

111
00:04:00,796 --> 0:04:02,456
Here under the Basic section,

112
00:04:03,286 --> 0:04:05,606
you'll see the Label property is

113
00:04:05,606 --> 0:04:06,696
set to the Image File Name.

114
00:04:08,116 --> 0:04:09,746
This creates a poor experience

115
00:04:09,826 --> 0:04:10,456
for our users.

116
00:04:11,596 --> 0:04:13,316
And to help you get an idea of

117
00:04:13,316 --> 0:04:15,266
this experience, we added a new

118
00:04:15,266 --> 0:04:16,846
feature that will simulate a

119
00:04:16,846 --> 0:04:18,636
VoiceOver would say by

120
00:04:18,636 --> 0:04:19,796
pressing on the speaker button.

121
00:04:21,065 --> 0:04:23,236
&gt;&gt; Camera.on.rectangle button.

122
00:04:24,126 --> 0:04:25,846
&gt;&gt; And I can use the Next button

123
00:04:26,006 --> 0:04:27,186
to jump to the next element.

124
00:04:27,556 --> 0:04:28,916
&gt;&gt; Sue.heart button.

125
00:04:29,886 --> 0:04:31,966
Cart.badge.plus button.

126
00:04:33,016 --> 0:04:34,286
&gt;&gt; So as we navigated over the

127
00:04:34,286 --> 0:04:36,246
buttons, we heard unhelpful

128
00:04:36,246 --> 0:04:36,716
descriptions.

129
00:04:37,816 --> 0:04:39,566
These descriptions didn't really

130
00:04:39,566 --> 0:04:41,206
tell us what the buttons do.

131
00:04:42,426 --> 0:04:43,986
So let's jump into Code and add

132
00:04:43,986 --> 0:04:45,326
some meaningful Labels for

133
00:04:45,326 --> 0:04:45,866
Custom buttons.

134
00:04:51,326 --> 0:04:53,806
To add a Label, we'll simply set

135
00:04:53,806 --> 0:04:55,666
the accessibility Label

136
00:04:55,666 --> 0:04:57,806
attribute under View.

137
00:04:58,176 --> 0:05:00,156
So for my Favorite button, I'll

138
00:04:58,176 --> 0:05:00,156
So for my Favorite button, I'll

139
00:05:00,186 --> 0:05:01,736
set it equal to the state of

140
00:05:01,736 --> 0:05:02,196
favorite.

141
00:05:02,706 --> 0:05:06,116
And for my Camera button, I'll

142
00:05:06,116 --> 0:05:08,076
simply set it to take a photo.

143
00:05:08,696 --> 0:05:12,486
And for my Buy button, I'll set

144
00:05:12,486 --> 0:05:13,036
it as Buy.

145
00:05:13,036 --> 0:05:15,366
And remember to properly

146
00:05:15,366 --> 0:05:16,186
localize your string.

147
00:05:17,816 --> 0:05:18,846
So now let's head back to the

148
00:05:18,846 --> 0:05:21,236
Inspector to see our remaining

149
00:05:21,236 --> 0:05:21,626
issues.

150
00:05:25,726 --> 0:05:27,276
Here it looks like there's a

151
00:05:27,276 --> 0:05:29,686
potentially inaccessible text.

152
00:05:31,156 --> 0:05:33,556
If you're using sender UIKit or

153
00:05:33,556 --> 0:05:35,066
app key controls, then

154
00:05:35,066 --> 0:05:36,346
accessibility comes for free.

155
00:05:37,216 --> 0:05:39,136
However, in this case, we're

156
00:05:39,136 --> 0:05:41,066
drawing the brand name using

157
00:05:41,066 --> 0:05:43,396
CATextLayer, which means we're

158
00:05:43,396 --> 0:05:45,536
responsible for handling our own

159
00:05:45,536 --> 0:05:46,166
accessibility.

160
00:05:46,846 --> 0:05:49,386
Let's jump into Code to see how

161
00:05:49,386 --> 0:05:50,726
we can make this Custom text

162
00:05:50,726 --> 0:05:51,376
accessible.

163
00:05:55,676 --> 0:05:56,766
So the first thing that I'll

164
00:05:56,766 --> 0:05:58,236
have to do is to let the

165
00:05:58,236 --> 0:06:00,036
assistive technologies know that

166
00:05:58,236 --> 0:06:00,036
assistive technologies know that

167
00:06:00,036 --> 0:06:01,506
this is an accessibility element

168
00:06:02,536 --> 0:06:05,136
and to do that, I'll simply set

169
00:06:05,256 --> 0:06:06,996
the isAccessibilityElement to

170
00:06:07,656 --> 0:06:07,766
true.

171
00:06:08,616 --> 0:06:11,276
Next, I'll have to give it a

172
00:06:11,276 --> 0:06:12,026
meaningful Label.

173
00:06:13,296 --> 0:06:15,246
And in our case, we'll set it

174
00:06:15,246 --> 0:06:17,426
equal to the brandName and

175
00:06:17,426 --> 0:06:19,566
that's it.

176
00:06:19,836 --> 0:06:20,586
So let's jump back to the

177
00:06:20,586 --> 0:06:22,026
Inspector to see our final

178
00:06:22,026 --> 0:06:22,316
issue.

179
00:06:25,736 --> 0:06:27,136
Here it looks like there's a

180
00:06:27,136 --> 0:06:28,496
contrast problem for our

181
00:06:28,496 --> 0:06:28,896
brandName.

182
00:06:29,966 --> 0:06:31,106
We can click on the Disclosure

183
00:06:31,106 --> 0:06:32,826
triangle to get a more detailed

184
00:06:32,826 --> 0:06:33,586
explanation.

185
00:06:34,246 --> 0:06:38,636
Here it shows a contrast ratio

186
00:06:38,966 --> 0:06:40,246
and the color we used to

187
00:06:40,246 --> 0:06:40,846
calculate it.

188
00:06:42,506 --> 0:06:43,916
Displaying information in a

189
00:06:43,916 --> 0:06:45,766
clear and legible manner is

190
00:06:45,766 --> 0:06:46,136
crucial.

191
00:06:46,726 --> 0:06:49,716
But it looks like the contrast

192
00:06:49,716 --> 0:06:51,146
for our brand name is too poor

193
00:06:51,146 --> 0:06:54,716
for the users to pick out text.

194
00:06:54,716 --> 0:06:59,136
Let's click on the Help button.

195
00:06:59,836 --> 0:07:00,666
Here it says that the

196
00:06:59,836 --> 0:07:00,666
Here it says that the

197
00:07:00,666 --> 0:07:02,156
recommended contrast ratio

198
00:07:02,406 --> 0:07:03,736
should be above 3.0.

199
00:07:04,866 --> 0:07:05,896
But how do we achieve this

200
00:07:05,896 --> 0:07:06,206
ratio?

201
00:07:07,566 --> 0:07:09,486
The Accessibility Inspector has

202
00:07:09,486 --> 0:07:11,256
a helpful tool called the Color

203
00:07:11,256 --> 0:07:12,226
Contrast Calculator.

204
00:07:13,146 --> 0:07:15,736
This tool insures that the text

205
00:07:15,736 --> 0:07:17,216
and it's background meets the

206
00:07:17,216 --> 0:07:18,496
recommended contrast ratio.

207
00:07:19,296 --> 0:07:20,846
And we can find that tool by

208
00:07:20,966 --> 0:07:24,236
going to Menus, Windows, Show

209
00:07:25,876 --> 0:07:27,936
Color Contrast Calculator.

210
00:07:27,986 --> 0:07:33,276
And now I'll click on the Color

211
00:07:33,276 --> 0:07:36,026
Picker to select the light gray

212
00:07:36,026 --> 0:07:38,946
color that I used for the brand

213
00:07:39,616 --> 0:07:39,706
name.

214
00:07:40,476 --> 0:07:43,766
Here you see that the contrast

215
00:07:43,766 --> 0:07:46,746
ratio is 2.3 which is below the

216
00:07:46,746 --> 0:07:48,116
recommended 3.0 ratio.

217
00:07:49,196 --> 0:07:50,926
So now I'm going to use a slider

218
00:07:51,086 --> 0:07:53,656
to pick a color to satisfy the

219
00:07:53,656 --> 0:07:55,796
contrast ratio without

220
00:07:55,796 --> 0:07:57,416
compromising my original design.

221
00:07:57,416 --> 0:08:00,456
And this dark gray color looks

222
00:07:57,416 --> 0:08:00,456
And this dark gray color looks

223
00:08:00,456 --> 0:08:01,066
just about right.

224
00:08:01,806 --> 0:08:02,866
Let's use that in our color.

225
00:08:09,536 --> 0:08:10,736
So the first thing now I have to

226
00:08:10,736 --> 0:08:13,586
do is to add the darkGrayColor,

227
00:08:13,686 --> 0:08:15,666
then I'll set the

228
00:08:15,886 --> 0:08:18,706
foregroundColor for my textLayer

229
00:08:20,016 --> 0:08:21,076
to be the color that we just

230
00:08:21,076 --> 0:08:21,326
added.

231
00:08:23,686 --> 0:08:25,326
Now for the moment of truth,

232
00:08:26,146 --> 0:08:27,716
let's run the app again to see

233
00:08:27,716 --> 0:08:33,046
how it works.

234
00:08:33,216 --> 0:08:34,706
While the app is running, I'm

235
00:08:34,706 --> 0:08:36,515
going to open the Inspector.

236
00:08:41,236 --> 0:08:43,376
To verify that all of our

237
00:08:43,376 --> 0:08:45,356
changes works, I'm going to run

238
00:08:45,356 --> 0:08:46,496
the Audit test once more.

239
00:08:49,956 --> 0:08:52,106
Great. It looks like all of the

240
00:08:52,106 --> 0:08:52,936
warnings are gone.

Creamy bullet no-stir.

254

This tastes great.

255
00:09:19,266 --> 0:09:22,076
&gt;&gt; And that's a much better

256
00:09:22,076 --> 0:09:22,576
experience.

of how the Accessibility

00:09:35,536 --> 0:09:37,396
Inspector can help you create a

260
00:09:37,456 --> 0:09:38,806
fantastic app experience.

261
00:09:39,596 --> 0:09:41,396
It is a powerful tool to help

262
00:09:41,396 --> 0:09:44,006
you find and fix accessibility

263
00:09:44,006 --> 0:09:46,926
issues and an easy way to get

264
00:09:46,926 --> 0:09:48,266
started with accessibility.

265
00:09:49,066 --> 0:09:51,126
I encourage you to spend a few

266
00:09:51,126 --> 0:09:53,356
minutes to audit for your own

267
00:09:53,356 --> 0:09:56,016
apps and to make sure that your

268
00:09:56,016 --> 0:09:58,756
app is accessible for everyone.
