00:00:07,196 --> 0:00:08,806
&gt;&gt; Hello. I'm Jonathan Davis,

3
00:00:08,806 --> 0:00:10,536
web technologies evangelist for

4
00:00:10,536 --> 0:00:12,006
the Safari and WebKit teams.

5
00:00:12,596 --> 0:00:14,236
Welcome to Auditing Web Content

6
00:00:14,236 --> 0:00:15,236
with Web Inspector.

7
00:00:16,006 --> 0:00:17,246
In the process of building web

8
00:00:17,246 --> 0:00:18,946
content, developers have a lot

9
00:00:18,946 --> 0:00:19,956
of details to check.

10
00:00:20,966 --> 0:00:22,676
Maybe it's following a CSS class

11
00:00:22,676 --> 0:00:24,446
name convention or ensuring good

12
00:00:24,446 --> 0:00:25,796
accessibility on the page.

13
00:00:25,876 --> 0:00:27,886
There can be so many details

14
00:00:27,886 --> 0:00:29,126
that they're easy to forget and

15
00:00:29,126 --> 0:00:30,556
tedious to find the issues.

16
00:00:31,296 --> 0:00:32,656
A built-in checklist would be

17
00:00:32,656 --> 0:00:33,066
ideal.

18
00:00:33,776 --> 0:00:35,196
Some teams set up automated

19
00:00:35,196 --> 0:00:36,546
testing in a continuous

20
00:00:36,546 --> 0:00:37,916
integration system using

21
00:00:37,916 --> 0:00:39,736
technologies like Safari's

22
00:00:39,736 --> 0:00:41,886
WebDriver, available for macOS

23
00:00:41,886 --> 0:00:43,066
and now iOS.

24
00:00:43,696 --> 0:00:45,066
WebDriver is a great tool for

25
00:00:45,066 --> 0:00:46,596
catching code changes that break

26
00:00:46,596 --> 0:00:47,966
expected functionality for

27
00:00:47,966 --> 0:00:48,516
users.

28
00:00:48,726 --> 0:00:50,736
But for web developers who want

29
00:00:50,736 --> 0:00:51,956
to check that their in-progress

30
00:00:51,956 --> 0:00:53,586
work meets code expectations,

31
00:00:54,066 --> 0:00:55,946
Web Inspector now includes a new

32
00:00:55,946 --> 0:00:57,676
audit system available with

33
00:00:57,676 --> 0:01:00,136
Safari 13 on macOS that provides

34
00:00:57,676 --> 0:01:00,136
Safari 13 on macOS that provides

35
00:01:00,136 --> 0:01:01,736
a quick, easy and more

36
00:01:01,736 --> 0:01:03,076
convenient way to check web

37
00:01:03,076 --> 0:01:03,506
content.

38
00:01:04,016 --> 0:01:07,106
In this video, I'll show you how

39
00:01:07,106 --> 0:01:08,626
to use audits in Web Inspector,

40
00:01:08,956 --> 0:01:10,666
how to work with tests and

41
00:01:10,666 --> 0:01:12,606
understand their results, and

42
00:01:12,606 --> 0:01:14,266
finally I'll cover how to create

43
00:01:14,266 --> 0:01:16,196
custom audits for your projects.

44
00:01:17,346 --> 0:01:18,746
To get started, you'll need to

45
00:01:18,746 --> 0:01:19,966
enable the Develop menu to

46
00:01:19,966 --> 0:01:21,046
access Web Inspector.

47
00:01:22,436 --> 0:01:24,126
Just load up Safari Preferences,

48
00:01:24,706 --> 0:01:27,066
click on Advanced and click to

49
00:01:27,066 --> 0:01:29,066
enable the Show Develop Menu in

50
00:01:29,066 --> 0:01:29,976
Menu Bar option.

51
00:01:31,816 --> 0:01:34,216
Now just load up a web page and

52
00:01:34,216 --> 0:01:35,306
open Web Inspector from the

53
00:01:35,306 --> 0:01:35,986
Develop menu.

54
00:01:36,826 --> 0:01:38,196
Or use the keyboard shortcut

55
00:01:38,196 --> 0:01:39,096
Command-Option-I.

56
00:01:40,866 --> 0:01:42,706
Let's take a look at WebKit.org

57
00:01:42,706 --> 0:01:43,516
as an example.

58
00:01:44,016 --> 0:01:45,416
Click over to the audit tab.

59
00:01:48,266 --> 0:01:49,696
And in the left sidebar is a

60
00:01:49,696 --> 0:01:50,736
list of audits.

61
00:01:51,416 --> 0:01:52,966
Click the arrow to the left of

62
00:01:52,966 --> 0:01:54,286
an audit to expand it.

63
00:01:55,166 --> 0:01:56,896
An audit is a collection of test

64
00:01:56,896 --> 0:01:58,126
groups and tests.

65
00:01:59,106 --> 0:02:00,216
Test groups don't have any

66
00:01:59,106 --> 0:02:00,216
Test groups don't have any

67
00:02:00,216 --> 0:02:01,676
functionality except to act as

68
00:02:01,676 --> 0:02:03,156
organizational containers for a

69
00:02:03,156 --> 0:02:04,976
collection of individual tests.

70
00:02:05,566 --> 0:02:07,426
It's easy to run audits.

71
00:02:07,706 --> 0:02:08,876
Click the Start button to run

72
00:02:08,876 --> 0:02:10,265
all of the available audits.

73
00:02:11,226 --> 0:02:12,426
Or you can right click on an

74
00:02:12,426 --> 0:02:14,046
audit for a contextual menu with

75
00:02:14,076 --> 0:02:14,876
more actions.

76
00:02:15,756 --> 0:02:17,406
To run a single audit, right

77
00:02:17,406 --> 0:02:18,736
click on the audit and select

78
00:02:18,736 --> 0:02:19,126
Start.

79
00:02:19,766 --> 0:02:21,166
Or you can hover over the right

80
00:02:21,166 --> 0:02:22,856
area of the side bar and a play

81
00:02:22,856 --> 0:02:23,586
button will appear.

82
00:02:24,156 --> 0:02:25,956
Or click to select it and press

83
00:02:25,956 --> 0:02:26,576
the space bar.

84
00:02:27,266 --> 0:02:28,706
Audits are fast and update in

85
00:02:28,706 --> 0:02:29,766
real time as tests are

86
00:02:29,766 --> 0:02:30,316
completed.

87
00:02:32,196 --> 0:02:33,436
Another way to control which

88
00:02:33,436 --> 0:02:35,546
audits are run is to click the

89
00:02:35,546 --> 0:02:37,306
Edit button at the bottom of the

90
00:02:37,306 --> 0:02:38,436
navigation sidebar.

91
00:02:41,356 --> 0:02:42,326
Here you can toggle the

92
00:02:42,326 --> 0:02:44,066
checkboxes on the row next to

93
00:02:44,066 --> 0:02:48,196
individual tests, test groups or

94
00:02:48,196 --> 0:02:49,876
entire audits to selectively

95
00:02:49,876 --> 0:02:54,116
enable or disable them.

96
00:02:54,236 --> 0:02:55,216
Click the done button at the

97
00:02:55,216 --> 0:02:56,146
bottom when you're finished

98
00:02:56,146 --> 0:02:56,486
editing.

99
00:02:57,116 --> 0:03:00,726
A list of any collected results

100
00:02:57,116 --> 0:03:00,726
A list of any collected results

101
00:03:00,726 --> 0:03:02,436
will appear below the audits in

102
00:03:02,436 --> 0:03:04,316
a results folder with each of

103
00:03:04,316 --> 0:03:05,976
the results collected into Run

104
00:03:05,976 --> 0:03:06,596
folders.

105
00:03:08,466 --> 0:03:10,346
Expand the Run folder to access

106
00:03:10,346 --> 0:03:11,596
the results of the audit for

107
00:03:11,596 --> 0:03:12,056
that run.

108
00:03:13,076 --> 0:03:14,446
The result runs are kept

109
00:03:14,446 --> 0:03:15,896
available across reloads of the

110
00:03:15,896 --> 0:03:17,686
page so you can modify the

111
00:03:17,686 --> 0:03:19,786
webpage and rerun the audit for

112
00:03:19,786 --> 0:03:20,766
updated results.

113
00:03:21,016 --> 0:03:22,576
That way you can compare the

114
00:03:22,576 --> 0:03:23,746
pass rate for example.

115
00:03:24,236 --> 0:03:25,686
Results will be cleared when Web

116
00:03:25,686 --> 0:03:26,806
Inspector is closed.

117
00:03:30,136 --> 0:03:31,256
Clicking on the results of the

118
00:03:31,256 --> 0:03:33,616
demo audit run displays a report

119
00:03:33,616 --> 0:03:35,386
that shows example result levels

120
00:03:35,386 --> 0:03:36,246
and result data.

121
00:03:38,506 --> 0:03:39,816
The first three result levels

122
00:03:39,816 --> 0:03:40,936
should be familiar if you've

123
00:03:40,936 --> 0:03:41,966
ever used XCode.

124
00:03:42,586 --> 0:03:43,836
The passed level shows a test

125
00:03:43,836 --> 0:03:45,466
that's passed, meaning the code

126
00:03:45,466 --> 0:03:46,546
met the expectations of the

127
00:03:46,546 --> 0:03:47,096
test.

128
00:03:47,706 --> 0:03:48,886
Warning is a soft pass.

129
00:03:49,246 --> 0:03:50,486
It says even though the code

130
00:03:50,486 --> 0:03:51,496
passed the test, there are

131
00:03:51,496 --> 0:03:52,536
things that could be changed.

132
00:03:53,376 --> 0:03:54,556
Failed tells you the code did

133
00:03:54,556 --> 0:03:55,856
not pass the test.

134
00:03:58,046 --> 0:03:59,246
The other two result levels are

135
00:03:59,246 --> 0:04:00,656
special to audits in Web

136
00:03:59,246 --> 0:04:00,656
special to audits in Web

137
00:04:00,656 --> 0:04:01,196
Inspector.

138
00:04:01,666 --> 0:04:03,456
An error result occurs when the

139
00:04:03,456 --> 0:04:04,686
JavaScript being run for the

140
00:04:04,686 --> 0:04:05,776
test throws an error.

141
00:04:06,446 --> 0:04:08,286
Unsupported is a special case

142
00:04:08,286 --> 0:04:09,496
that can be used to indicate

143
00:04:09,496 --> 0:04:11,026
when the data being tested isn't

144
00:04:11,026 --> 0:04:12,356
supported by the current page,

145
00:04:12,766 --> 0:04:13,576
such as when there's some

146
00:04:13,576 --> 0:04:14,206
missing API.

147
00:04:14,786 --> 0:04:17,386
Test results can also include

148
00:04:17,386 --> 0:04:18,976
data from the test in the form

149
00:04:18,976 --> 0:04:20,815
of DOM nodes or error messages.

150
00:04:23,626 --> 0:04:24,896
Web Inspector includes some

151
00:04:24,896 --> 0:04:26,466
built-in audits by default which

152
00:04:26,466 --> 0:04:28,186
can be disabled but not deleted.

153
00:04:29,126 --> 0:04:30,366
One of the default audits

154
00:04:30,366 --> 0:04:31,896
provides tests that check a

155
00:04:31,896 --> 0:04:33,406
webpage for mark-up that meets

156
00:04:33,406 --> 0:04:35,086
some common guidelines for good

157
00:04:35,086 --> 0:04:35,946
accessibility.

158
00:04:37,666 --> 0:04:38,956
Let's dig into the results of

159
00:04:38,956 --> 0:04:40,366
running the accessibility audit

160
00:04:40,556 --> 0:04:41,546
on WebKit.org.

161
00:04:43,086 --> 0:04:44,606
The overall score shows that

162
00:04:44,606 --> 0:04:45,886
WebKit does fairly well.

163
00:04:45,886 --> 0:04:47,296
But there's room for

164
00:04:47,296 --> 0:04:47,946
improvement.

165
00:04:49,656 --> 0:04:51,006
In the failure cases shown in

166
00:04:51,006 --> 0:04:52,676
the results, the DOM node where

167
00:04:52,676 --> 0:04:54,386
the failure was detected is

168
00:04:54,386 --> 0:04:55,976
shown as an interactive DOM

169
00:04:55,976 --> 0:04:56,276
tree.

170
00:04:57,206 --> 0:04:58,486
Expanding the DOM tree for the

171
00:04:58,486 --> 0:05:00,306
node allows you to access child

172
00:04:58,486 --> 0:05:00,306
node allows you to access child

173
00:05:00,306 --> 0:05:00,796
nodes.

174
00:05:01,006 --> 0:05:02,476
And hovering over them will

175
00:05:02,476 --> 0:05:03,986
highlight the specific elements

176
00:05:03,986 --> 0:05:05,666
on the page, just like using the

177
00:05:05,666 --> 0:05:06,446
elements tab.

178
00:05:11,206 --> 0:05:12,946
This makes it trivially easy to

179
00:05:12,946 --> 0:05:14,536
understand what code in your web

180
00:05:14,536 --> 0:05:15,986
content needs improvement.

181
00:05:17,296 --> 0:05:19,486
To fix this, I can simply click

182
00:05:19,486 --> 0:05:20,876
this arrow to go right to the

183
00:05:20,876 --> 0:05:22,166
node in the elements tab.

184
00:05:22,466 --> 0:05:24,566
The problem is elements with the

185
00:05:24,566 --> 0:05:26,246
role of menu need their child

186
00:05:26,246 --> 0:05:27,996
elements to have a role of menu

187
00:05:27,996 --> 0:05:28,426
item.

188
00:05:29,696 --> 0:05:31,466
So I simply need to add a new

189
00:05:31,466 --> 0:05:33,326
role attribute with a value of

190
00:05:33,326 --> 0:05:35,296
menu item to each of the child

191
00:05:35,296 --> 0:05:36,496
elements of the menu.

192
00:05:37,426 --> 0:05:38,876
I'm going to quickly add the

193
00:05:38,876 --> 0:05:40,196
missing attribute to each of

194
00:05:40,196 --> 0:05:40,976
these elements.

195
00:05:45,046 --> 0:05:45,586
Just a couple more.

196
00:05:50,666 --> 0:05:51,026
Okay.

197
00:05:51,906 --> 0:05:52,986
Now I'll switch back to the

198
00:05:52,986 --> 0:05:54,666
audit tab so I can rerun the

199
00:05:54,666 --> 0:05:56,456
audit and see the new results

200
00:05:56,456 --> 0:05:57,686
with these changes in the DOM.

201
00:06:01,366 --> 0:06:02,006
Perfect.

202
00:06:02,086 --> 0:06:03,606
The page now passes all of the

203
00:06:03,606 --> 0:06:04,126
tests.

204
00:06:04,746 --> 0:06:06,046
I simply need to incorporate

205
00:06:06,046 --> 0:06:07,626
those changes into the actual

206
00:06:07,626 --> 0:06:08,616
code for the site.

207
00:06:11,486 --> 0:06:12,906
You can see how easy it is to

208
00:06:12,906 --> 0:06:14,606
spot problems and fix them all

209
00:06:14,606 --> 0:06:15,826
conveniently within Web

210
00:06:15,826 --> 0:06:16,336
Inspector.

211
00:06:16,876 --> 0:06:19,196
Audits and audit results can be

212
00:06:19,196 --> 0:06:20,976
exported and re-imported.

213
00:06:21,586 --> 0:06:23,136
Click the Export button to save

214
00:06:23,136 --> 0:06:25,006
the results into a JSON file.

215
00:06:26,086 --> 0:06:27,576
They can be re-imported into Web

216
00:06:27,576 --> 0:06:29,326
Inspector with complete access

217
00:06:29,326 --> 0:06:30,476
to the results, including

218
00:06:30,476 --> 0:06:32,106
interactive DOM nodes, when

219
00:06:32,106 --> 0:06:33,876
elements on the page match the

220
00:06:33,876 --> 0:06:35,036
nodes in the report.

221
00:06:36,816 --> 0:06:38,366
You can also export the built-in

222
00:06:38,366 --> 0:06:40,006
audits to see an example of how

223
00:06:40,006 --> 0:06:41,316
to write your own audits.

224
00:06:41,666 --> 0:06:42,996
As most teams will have their

225
00:06:42,996 --> 0:06:44,586
own unique code objectives,

226
00:06:44,886 --> 0:06:46,396
writing your own custom audits

227
00:06:46,396 --> 0:06:47,676
is one of the most powerful

228
00:06:47,676 --> 0:06:49,236
aspects of using the audit

229
00:06:49,236 --> 0:06:50,636
framework in Web Inspector.

230
00:06:51,956 --> 0:06:53,906
They use a JSON format to make

231
00:06:53,906 --> 0:06:54,536
them portable.

232
00:06:55,046 --> 0:06:56,376
Each test is simply a

233
00:06:56,376 --> 0:06:58,006
stringified JavaScript function

234
00:06:58,486 --> 0:06:59,876
giving you a simple framework

235
00:06:59,986 --> 0:07:01,496
with special access to more data

236
00:06:59,986 --> 0:07:01,496
with special access to more data

237
00:07:01,496 --> 0:07:02,786
than you can normally access in

238
00:07:02,786 --> 0:07:03,376
JavaScript.

239
00:07:04,376 --> 0:07:06,206
Being simple JSON, it's easy to

240
00:07:06,206 --> 0:07:07,856
share your tests with your team

241
00:07:07,956 --> 0:07:08,996
or other developers.

242
00:07:09,966 --> 0:07:12,046
There's an example ESLint audit

243
00:07:12,046 --> 0:07:13,516
available on the WebKit blog

244
00:07:13,516 --> 0:07:14,736
post about creating Web

245
00:07:14,736 --> 0:07:15,616
Inspector audits.

246
00:07:16,406 --> 0:07:18,046
The blog post goes into detail

247
00:07:18,046 --> 0:07:19,156
about how to write a custom

248
00:07:19,156 --> 0:07:20,896
audit as well as other powerful

249
00:07:20,896 --> 0:07:22,526
capabilities of using the audit

250
00:07:22,526 --> 0:07:23,036
framework.

251
00:07:23,656 --> 0:07:25,886
Simply download the ESLint JSON

252
00:07:25,886 --> 0:07:28,706
file and you can easily drag and

253
00:07:28,706 --> 0:07:30,526
drop the file onto Web Inspector

254
00:07:30,716 --> 0:07:31,926
to import it.

255
00:07:34,116 --> 0:07:35,386
Audits in Web Inspector are

256
00:07:35,386 --> 0:07:37,276
quick and convenient, so I hope

257
00:07:37,276 --> 0:07:38,646
you'll give them a try using the

258
00:07:38,646 --> 0:07:40,196
built-in accessibility audit on

259
00:07:40,196 --> 0:07:41,336
your own web pages.

260
00:07:42,746 --> 0:07:44,386
Use the portable audit format to

261
00:07:44,386 --> 0:07:45,636
create your own audits and

262
00:07:45,636 --> 0:07:47,636
ensure in-progress code meets

263
00:07:47,636 --> 0:07:48,946
your project standards.

264
00:07:49,546 --> 0:07:51,446
And we love hearing from you and

265
00:07:51,446 --> 0:07:52,676
hope you'll file bug reports for

266
00:07:52,676 --> 0:07:54,216
any issues you find or feature

267
00:07:54,216 --> 0:07:56,006
requests you might have.

268
00:07:56,146 --> 0:07:57,366
