00:00:12,086 --> 0:00:12,826
&gt;&gt; Hi, everyone.

3
00:00:13,556 --> 0:00:14,326
My name is Dan.

4
00:00:14,716 --> 0:00:15,636
I'm an engineer on the

5
00:00:15,636 --> 0:00:17,316
Accessibility Team, and I'm

6
00:00:17,316 --> 0:00:18,506
super excited to be talking to

7
00:00:18,506 --> 0:00:20,086
you about Accessibility Custom

8
00:00:20,086 --> 0:00:21,696
Actions and how they can improve

9
00:00:21,696 --> 0:00:23,336
the experience for people using

10
00:00:23,336 --> 0:00:24,976
assistive technologies with your

11
00:00:24,976 --> 0:00:25,346
apps.

12
00:00:25,996 --> 0:00:26,646
Let's get started.

13
00:00:28,016 --> 0:00:29,656
Custom actions are really great

14
00:00:29,656 --> 0:00:30,386
for two things.

15
00:00:31,106 --> 0:00:32,826
The first is reducing clutter in

16
00:00:32,826 --> 0:00:33,206
your app.

17
00:00:34,246 --> 0:00:35,436
This is important for everyone

18
00:00:35,436 --> 0:00:37,026
that uses your app, but it's

19
00:00:37,026 --> 0:00:38,256
especially important for people

20
00:00:38,256 --> 0:00:39,796
that use assistive technologies,

21
00:00:40,056 --> 0:00:40,916
and I'll explain why.

22
00:00:41,816 --> 0:00:43,346
The second is all about

23
00:00:43,346 --> 0:00:44,736
improving the convenience and

24
00:00:44,736 --> 0:00:46,066
speed of more complex

25
00:00:46,066 --> 0:00:47,906
interactions in your app.

26
00:00:48,966 --> 0:00:50,216
Let's start by talking about

27
00:00:50,216 --> 0:00:52,426
reducing clutter and to do this

28
00:00:52,426 --> 0:00:53,196
I'd like to talk about

29
00:00:53,196 --> 0:00:53,786
VoiceOver.

30
00:00:54,746 --> 0:00:55,986
VoiceOver is the built-in screen

31
00:00:55,986 --> 0:00:57,076
reader we ship across many of

32
00:00:57,076 --> 0:00:58,246
our products for people who are

33
00:00:58,246 --> 0:00:59,406
blind and low vision.

34
00:01:00,486 --> 0:01:01,746
People that use VoiceOver can

35
00:01:01,746 --> 0:01:02,886
navigate through their apps in a

36
00:01:02,886 --> 0:01:04,936
variety of ways but one way

37
00:01:04,995 --> 0:01:06,616
that's particularly popular when

38
00:01:06,616 --> 0:01:07,986
navigating through a new app or

39
00:01:07,986 --> 0:01:10,066
interface is by swiping left and

40
00:01:10,066 --> 0:01:11,606
right to move between the next

41
00:01:11,606 --> 0:01:12,366
and previous item.

42
00:01:13,066 --> 0:01:15,756
I have an app I've been working

43
00:01:15,756 --> 0:01:16,866
on to help me track my favorite

44
00:01:16,866 --> 0:01:17,586
types of peanut butter.

45
00:01:18,146 --> 0:01:19,486
If you were going to use this

46
00:01:19,486 --> 0:01:22,066
app without using VoiceOver and

47
00:01:22,066 --> 0:01:23,326
we wanted to increase the rating

48
00:01:23,326 --> 0:01:24,466
of the second jar of peanut

49
00:01:24,466 --> 0:01:26,886
butter in this list, how do we

50
00:01:26,886 --> 0:01:27,476
go about doing that?

51
00:01:28,906 --> 0:01:30,766
Well, you'd probably visually

52
00:01:30,766 --> 0:01:32,396
scan the list until you found

53
00:01:32,396 --> 0:01:33,336
the jar you were looking for.

54
00:01:34,696 --> 0:01:35,746
You then might focus on that

55
00:01:35,746 --> 0:01:37,276
cell and look for the button

56
00:01:37,276 --> 0:01:38,416
that affords the action you want

57
00:01:38,416 --> 0:01:41,486
to perform and then tap on it.

58
00:01:42,156 --> 0:01:43,396
Now that may seem pretty

59
00:01:43,396 --> 0:01:46,026
intuitive but that's because the

60
00:01:46,026 --> 0:01:47,426
UI affords that intuition by

61
00:01:47,426 --> 0:01:48,846
logically grouping the buttons

62
00:01:48,896 --> 0:01:51,036
with the cells, which makes the

63
00:01:51,036 --> 0:01:52,806
content easy for us to process

64
00:01:52,806 --> 0:01:56,016
and digest, but what if instead

65
00:01:56,016 --> 0:01:57,136
the app was laid out a bit

66
00:01:57,166 --> 0:01:57,666
differently?

67
00:01:58,726 --> 0:02:01,036
Perhaps something like this.

68
00:01:58,726 --> 0:02:01,036
Perhaps something like this.

69
00:02:01,706 --> 0:02:03,996
Notice the buttons are now

70
00:02:03,996 --> 0:02:05,566
underneath the cells, which

71
00:02:05,566 --> 0:02:06,736
means we have a lot more content

72
00:02:06,736 --> 0:02:07,396
to scroll through.

73
00:02:08,545 --> 0:02:09,735
Additionally, it's much more

74
00:02:09,735 --> 0:02:11,296
ambiguous as to which buttons

75
00:02:11,296 --> 0:02:12,486
correspond to which cells.

76
00:02:13,146 --> 0:02:15,276
This could very well be the

77
00:02:15,276 --> 0:02:16,736
experience for someone using

78
00:02:16,736 --> 0:02:18,026
VoiceOver with your app.

79
00:02:18,826 --> 0:02:19,806
Let me show you what I mean.

80
00:02:20,916 --> 0:02:21,776
Let's take a look at what it's

81
00:02:21,776 --> 0:02:23,206
like to use VoiceOver to

82
00:02:23,206 --> 0:02:24,046
navigate through one of the

83
00:02:24,046 --> 0:02:25,806
cells of this app.

84
00:02:26,396 --> 0:02:30,116
&gt;&gt; Patty's, creamy, Noster rated

85
00:02:30,116 --> 0:02:30,926
1 out of 5.

86
00:02:30,926 --> 0:02:33,116
Add to favorites button.

87
00:02:33,436 --> 0:02:35,296
Decrease rating button.

88
00:02:35,736 --> 0:02:37,596
Increase rating button.

89
00:02:39,176 --> 0:02:40,816
&gt;&gt; After we swipe past the cell

90
00:02:41,466 --> 0:02:43,696
we focused on three buttons, add

91
00:02:43,696 --> 0:02:45,546
to favorites, decrease rating

92
00:02:45,796 --> 0:02:47,776
and increase rating and those

93
00:02:47,826 --> 0:02:49,166
three buttons exist in every

94
00:02:49,166 --> 0:02:50,386
single cell in this list.

95
00:02:51,706 --> 0:02:53,096
So if we were trying to find the

96
00:02:53,096 --> 0:02:55,106
10th jar, we would have listened

97
00:02:55,106 --> 0:02:57,726
to those buttons 30 times, which

98
00:02:57,726 --> 0:02:59,146
can very quickly get repetitive.

99
00:03:00,276 --> 0:03:01,426
Additionally, we have to keep in

100
00:03:01,426 --> 0:03:02,846
our head what the last jar of

101
00:03:02,846 --> 0:03:03,926
peanut butter we heard was,

102
00:03:04,616 --> 0:03:06,156
otherwise we don't know what

103
00:03:06,156 --> 0:03:07,366
content is going to be affected

104
00:03:07,366 --> 0:03:08,546
when we activate one of those

105
00:03:08,546 --> 0:03:09,000
controls.

106
00:03:10,816 --> 0:03:12,206
So let's take a look at the app

107
00:03:12,206 --> 0:03:13,356
only this time designed a bit

108
00:03:13,356 --> 0:03:13,836
differently.

109
00:03:14,526 --> 0:03:15,556
I've changed the buttons so that

110
00:03:15,556 --> 0:03:16,676
they're no longer accessible to

111
00:03:16,676 --> 0:03:17,246
VoiceOver.

112
00:03:17,776 --> 0:03:19,246
I've added custom actions to the

113
00:03:19,316 --> 0:03:21,006
cells so that when VoiceOver

114
00:03:21,006 --> 0:03:22,536
lands on a cell we can swipe up

115
00:03:22,536 --> 0:03:23,956
or down with one finger to

116
00:03:23,956 --> 0:03:25,496
choose an action and then double

117
00:03:25,496 --> 0:03:26,486
tap to perform it.

118
00:03:27,076 --> 0:03:27,626
Let's take a look.

119
00:03:29,056 --> 0:03:32,456
&gt;&gt; Patty's, creamy, Noster rated

120
00:03:32,456 --> 0:03:33,626
1 out of 5.

121
00:03:33,746 --> 0:03:36,126
Anna's, chunky, sugar-free,

122
00:03:36,766 --> 0:03:38,096
rated 4 out of 5.

123
00:03:38,406 --> 0:03:40,416
Actions available toggle

124
00:03:40,416 --> 0:03:43,226
favorite, increase rating.

125
00:03:44,616 --> 0:03:46,596
&gt;&gt; This time when we swipe past

126
00:03:46,596 --> 0:03:48,576
the cell we just got to the next

127
00:03:48,576 --> 0:03:50,586
one which made it much easier

128
00:03:50,586 --> 0:03:51,526
for us to go through this

129
00:03:51,526 --> 0:03:52,876
content and find what we are

130
00:03:52,876 --> 0:03:53,446
looking for.

131
00:03:54,286 --> 0:03:55,996
Once we found it, we could then

132
00:03:55,996 --> 0:03:57,536
drill in and pick an interaction

133
00:03:57,536 --> 0:03:59,086
from there, which much more

134
00:03:59,086 --> 0:04:00,556
closely matches the experience

135
00:03:59,086 --> 0:04:00,556
closely matches the experience

136
00:04:00,556 --> 0:04:01,786
we talked about earlier of

137
00:04:01,786 --> 0:04:03,626
visually scanning a list.

138
00:04:04,836 --> 0:04:06,446
So custom actions can really

139
00:04:06,446 --> 0:04:08,656
help us reduce clutter, we

140
00:04:08,656 --> 0:04:10,146
remove the repetitive controls,

141
00:04:10,776 --> 0:04:11,676
and we also reduced the

142
00:04:11,676 --> 0:04:13,266
cognitive load on ourselves

143
00:04:13,266 --> 0:04:14,346
while we were using the app.

144
00:04:15,246 --> 0:04:16,685
Because we're explicitly picking

145
00:04:16,685 --> 0:04:18,305
an interaction after finding the

146
00:04:18,305 --> 0:04:19,906
content we want to interact with

147
00:04:20,676 --> 0:04:22,166
it's no longer ambiguous what

148
00:04:22,166 --> 0:04:23,096
those controls do.

149
00:04:24,306 --> 0:04:25,296
All of this simplified the

150
00:04:25,296 --> 0:04:25,866
experience.

151
00:04:28,696 --> 0:04:30,436
Next let's talk about how custom

152
00:04:30,436 --> 0:04:31,646
actions can improve the

153
00:04:31,646 --> 0:04:33,126
convenience and speed of more

154
00:04:33,126 --> 0:04:34,496
complex interactions in your app

155
00:04:35,546 --> 0:04:36,566
and to do this I'd like to talk

156
00:04:36,566 --> 0:04:37,386
about Switch Control.

157
00:04:37,386 --> 0:04:39,686
This is another feature we ship

158
00:04:39,686 --> 0:04:41,096
for people with limited mobility

159
00:04:41,096 --> 0:04:42,706
and these people can interact

160
00:04:42,706 --> 0:04:43,996
with their devices using as few

161
00:04:43,996 --> 0:04:45,316
as one or two inputs.

162
00:04:45,856 --> 0:04:48,096
I've added some additional

163
00:04:48,096 --> 0:04:49,186
functionality into the peanut

164
00:04:49,186 --> 0:04:50,836
butter app so that when we long

165
00:04:50,836 --> 0:04:52,596
press on a cell an action sheet

166
00:04:52,596 --> 0:04:54,016
comes up with additional options

167
00:04:54,606 --> 0:04:55,896
including the option to send

168
00:04:55,896 --> 0:04:57,126
information about one of the

169
00:04:57,126 --> 0:04:58,186
jars of peanut butter to a

170
00:04:58,186 --> 0:04:58,576
friend.

171
00:04:58,676 --> 0:05:00,586
I have two switches paired with

172
00:04:58,676 --> 0:05:00,586
I have two switches paired with

173
00:05:00,586 --> 0:05:00,986
the device.

174
00:05:01,966 --> 0:05:03,336
The orange switch will move

175
00:05:03,376 --> 0:05:04,566
Switch Control's focus to the

176
00:05:04,566 --> 0:05:06,646
next item and the white switch

177
00:05:06,646 --> 0:05:07,636
will select that item.

178
00:05:08,686 --> 0:05:09,996
Keep in mind switches can be

179
00:05:09,996 --> 0:05:11,016
designed for a variety of

180
00:05:11,016 --> 0:05:11,516
different needs.

181
00:05:12,146 --> 0:05:13,566
So, for example, someone might

182
00:05:13,566 --> 0:05:14,696
have switches mounted to a

183
00:05:14,696 --> 0:05:15,566
wheelchair that they can

184
00:05:15,566 --> 0:05:16,346
activate with their head.

185
00:05:17,786 --> 0:05:18,656
Let's take a look at what it's

186
00:05:18,656 --> 0:05:20,866
like to Switch Control to send

187
00:05:20,866 --> 0:05:22,076
information about that second

188
00:05:22,076 --> 0:05:23,066
jar of peanut butter to our

189
00:05:23,066 --> 0:05:23,500
friend.

190
00:05:25,656 --> 0:05:27,196
So we can use our orange switch

191
00:05:27,346 --> 0:05:28,516
to navigate down to the second

192
00:05:28,516 --> 0:05:30,066
cell and then use the white

193
00:05:30,126 --> 0:05:31,116
switch to select it.

194
00:05:31,906 --> 0:05:32,836
This brings up the Switch

195
00:05:32,836 --> 0:05:34,336
Control Menu which provides

196
00:05:34,336 --> 0:05:35,656
additional options of ways we

197
00:05:35,656 --> 0:05:36,726
can interact with the cell.

198
00:05:37,846 --> 0:05:39,056
We can navigate down to the page

199
00:05:39,056 --> 0:05:40,896
control and select it to view

200
00:05:40,896 --> 0:05:41,666
more options.

201
00:05:42,596 --> 0:05:44,446
From here, we can press select

202
00:05:44,566 --> 0:05:46,106
to drill in and then navigate

203
00:05:46,106 --> 0:05:46,906
over to gestures.

204
00:05:47,856 --> 0:05:49,246
Selecting this will give us a

205
00:05:49,246 --> 0:05:50,836
list of all of the gestures we

206
00:05:50,836 --> 0:05:52,276
might have wanted to perform by

207
00:05:52,276 --> 0:05:53,096
touching the display.

208
00:05:54,196 --> 0:05:55,926
From here we can navigate down

209
00:05:55,926 --> 0:05:57,246
to the second row and press

210
00:05:57,246 --> 0:05:59,046
select to drill in and then

211
00:05:59,046 --> 0:06:00,576
navigate over to tap and hold.

212
00:05:59,046 --> 0:06:00,576
navigate over to tap and hold.

213
00:06:01,576 --> 0:06:03,006
Selecting this will perform our

214
00:06:03,006 --> 0:06:04,496
long press gesture and bring up

215
00:06:04,496 --> 0:06:06,126
our action sheet, which we can

216
00:06:06,126 --> 0:06:08,126
then navigate through to select

217
00:06:08,266 --> 0:06:08,996
send to a friend.

218
00:06:09,966 --> 0:06:12,556
We'll perform the tap and we're

219
00:06:12,556 --> 0:06:13,000
done.

220
00:06:14,556 --> 0:06:17,356
Now if you think about it, we

221
00:06:17,356 --> 0:06:19,886
did all of that and we never

222
00:06:19,886 --> 0:06:20,726
touched the display.

223
00:06:22,176 --> 0:06:23,316
That's pretty cool, right?

224
00:06:24,946 --> 0:06:26,156
But you also probably noticed

225
00:06:26,156 --> 0:06:27,386
that that interaction normally

226
00:06:27,386 --> 0:06:29,946
takes us two taps, one long

227
00:06:29,946 --> 0:06:31,646
press and one tap on the action

228
00:06:31,646 --> 0:06:33,806
sheet and with Switch Control

229
00:06:34,836 --> 0:06:38,186
that took us 18 taps, but custom

230
00:06:38,186 --> 0:06:39,756
actions can significantly reduce

231
00:06:39,756 --> 0:06:40,256
that number.

232
00:06:41,836 --> 0:06:43,596
So let's take a look again only

233
00:06:43,596 --> 0:06:44,706
this time I've added custom

234
00:06:44,706 --> 0:06:45,826
actions back into the app.

235
00:06:47,006 --> 0:06:48,006
We'll still use the orange

236
00:06:48,006 --> 0:06:49,156
switch to navigate down to the

237
00:06:49,206 --> 0:06:51,436
second cell only this time when

238
00:06:51,436 --> 0:06:53,276
we select it right away on the

239
00:06:53,386 --> 0:06:54,526
first page of the Switch Control

240
00:06:54,526 --> 0:06:56,066
Menu are all of the actions of

241
00:06:56,066 --> 0:06:56,716
we've implemented.

242
00:06:57,426 --> 0:06:59,306
We can drill in, navigate over

243
00:06:59,306 --> 0:07:01,056
to send to a friend, press

244
00:06:59,306 --> 0:07:01,056
to send to a friend, press

245
00:07:01,116 --> 0:07:03,736
select and we're done.

246
00:07:05,056 --> 0:07:06,326
We didn't even need to navigate

247
00:07:06,326 --> 0:07:07,396
through the action sheet that

248
00:07:07,396 --> 0:07:08,386
came up the first time.

249
00:07:08,926 --> 0:07:10,866
We're right where we need to be.

250
00:07:11,576 --> 0:07:13,516
That was a significantly faster

251
00:07:13,516 --> 0:07:14,066
interaction.

252
00:07:14,066 --> 0:07:16,626
We were able to take those 18

253
00:07:16,626 --> 0:07:18,896
taps and we get all the way down

254
00:07:18,896 --> 0:07:21,836
to 6 taps, which is 67% fewer

255
00:07:21,836 --> 0:07:22,806
taps than before.

256
00:07:23,406 --> 0:07:26,366
So custom actions can provide

257
00:07:26,496 --> 0:07:27,926
huge wins for convenience and

258
00:07:27,926 --> 0:07:28,336
speed.

259
00:07:29,566 --> 0:07:30,566
We removed the cumbersome

260
00:07:30,566 --> 0:07:32,036
gestures which significantly

261
00:07:32,036 --> 0:07:33,036
sped up the interaction.

262
00:07:33,966 --> 0:07:35,286
Additionally, we improved the

263
00:07:35,336 --> 0:07:36,856
prominence and the convenience

264
00:07:36,856 --> 0:07:38,466
of those interaction options by

265
00:07:38,466 --> 0:07:39,666
placing them on the first page

266
00:07:39,666 --> 0:07:40,656
of the Switch Control Menu.

267
00:07:41,606 --> 0:07:42,566
We didn't need to navigate

268
00:07:42,566 --> 0:07:44,166
through several submenus and try

269
00:07:44,166 --> 0:07:45,526
out different gestures to figure

270
00:07:45,526 --> 0:07:46,516
what might be possible.

271
00:07:47,186 --> 0:07:48,526
Instead, everything was much

272
00:07:48,526 --> 0:07:50,606
more straightforward and direct.

273
00:07:51,436 --> 0:07:52,746
Now I bet after hearing all

274
00:07:52,746 --> 0:07:54,266
these awesome advantages of

275
00:07:54,266 --> 0:07:55,946
custom actions you just can't

276
00:07:55,946 --> 0:07:57,116
wait to use them in your apps

277
00:07:57,646 --> 0:07:58,896
and luckily it's pretty easy.

278
00:08:00,046 --> 0:08:00,926
You simply override the

279
00:08:00,996 --> 0:08:02,286
Accessibility Custom Actions

280
00:08:02,286 --> 0:08:04,406
property on your view and return

281
00:08:04,406 --> 0:08:06,026
an array of UI accessibility,

282
00:08:06,026 --> 0:08:07,236
custom action objects.

283
00:08:08,186 --> 0:08:09,886
Each one takes in a name, a

284
00:08:09,886 --> 0:08:11,036
target, and a selector.

285
00:08:12,206 --> 0:08:13,676
Your function simply needs to

286
00:08:13,676 --> 0:08:14,936
return a Boolean as to whether

287
00:08:14,936 --> 0:08:16,226
or not the action was successful

288
00:08:17,156 --> 0:08:18,466
and take in an UI accessibility

289
00:08:18,466 --> 0:08:19,696
custom action object as a

290
00:08:19,696 --> 0:08:20,136
parameter.

291
00:08:20,736 --> 0:08:23,316
New this year we have a version

292
00:08:23,316 --> 0:08:24,626
of the API that takes in an

293
00:08:24,626 --> 0:08:25,936
action handler instead of a

294
00:08:25,936 --> 0:08:26,756
target and selector.

295
00:08:27,476 --> 0:08:28,576
So if using a block of code

296
00:08:28,636 --> 0:08:29,606
better fits with the design of

297
00:08:29,606 --> 0:08:30,996
your app, we encourage you to

298
00:08:30,996 --> 0:08:31,656
give this a try.

[ Applause ]

300
00:08:36,515 --> 0:08:36,866
Yes.

301
00:08:38,306 --> 0:08:39,226
Additionally, if you're going to

302
00:08:39,226 --> 0:08:40,716
use a custom action to replace

303
00:08:40,716 --> 0:08:41,895
something like an accessory

304
00:08:41,895 --> 0:08:43,756
control inside of a cell, you'll

305
00:08:43,756 --> 0:08:44,776
often want to set is

306
00:08:44,776 --> 0:08:46,236
accessibility element to false

307
00:08:46,236 --> 0:08:47,786
on those controls so they're no

308
00:08:47,786 --> 0:08:48,706
longer navigable by the

309
00:08:48,706 --> 0:08:49,646
assistive technology.

VoiceOver and Switch Control in

312
00:08:54,256 --> 0:08:56,486
our demos today, custom actions

313
00:08:56,486 --> 0:08:57,786
can be leveraged across many of

314
00:08:57,786 --> 0:08:59,036

access and voice control which

318
00:09:02,426 --> 0:09:03,116
are new this year.

319
00:09:03,856 --> 0:09:04,976
I really encourage you to turn

320
00:09:04,976 --> 0:09:06,526
some of these features on and

321
00:09:06,526 --> 0:09:07,866
play around with your apps to

322
00:09:07,866 --> 0:09:09,356
look for ways custom actions can

323
00:09:09,356 --> 0:09:10,346
improve the experience.

324
00:09:11,166 --> 0:09:11,826
Thank you very much.
