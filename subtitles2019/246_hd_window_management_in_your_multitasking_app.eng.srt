00:00:08,496 --> 0:00:09,406
&gt;&gt; Hi, everybody.

3
00:00:09,466 --> 0:00:10,886
I'm Giovanni Tarducci, from the

4
00:00:10,886 --> 0:00:12,316
System UI SpringBoard team.

5
00:00:12,546 --> 0:00:13,966
And today, I'm happy to tell you

6
00:00:14,046 --> 0:00:15,246
everything about managing your

7
00:00:15,246 --> 0:00:16,746
windows on iPadOS.

8
00:00:17,696 --> 0:00:19,406
We are introducing three new

9
00:00:19,406 --> 0:00:21,006
API's, to do just that.

10
00:00:21,196 --> 0:00:22,596
To respectively activate,

11
00:00:22,716 --> 0:00:24,926
refresh, or destroy any of your

12
00:00:24,926 --> 0:00:25,646
scene sessions.

13
00:00:26,406 --> 0:00:28,216
But let's jump right into a demo

14
00:00:28,506 --> 0:00:29,846
of these API's at work, in an

15
00:00:29,846 --> 0:00:30,956
app we've been prototyping.

16
00:00:38,886 --> 0:00:42,086
Okay. We call it Clown Town.

17
00:00:42,246 --> 0:00:43,876
And it's a great new way to get

18
00:00:43,876 --> 0:00:45,056
a clown for your party.

19
00:00:45,706 --> 0:00:47,456
It opens to a full-screen map,

20
00:00:47,766 --> 0:00:48,946
showing all the clowns in my

21
00:00:48,946 --> 0:00:49,456
network.

22
00:00:49,846 --> 0:00:51,346
I can tap on any of their

23
00:00:51,346 --> 0:00:53,206
markers, to see more about them.

24
00:00:54,376 --> 0:00:56,336
The implementation is straight

25
00:00:56,336 --> 0:00:57,386
forward, as well.

26
00:00:57,586 --> 0:00:59,146
The detail view controller just

27
00:00:59,146 --> 0:01:00,606
knows how to show a clown with a

28
00:00:59,146 --> 0:01:00,606
knows how to show a clown with a

29
00:01:00,606 --> 0:01:01,336
given ID.

30
00:01:01,696 --> 0:01:03,206
While the map view controller,

31
00:01:03,326 --> 0:01:04,506
delegates everything,

32
00:01:04,656 --> 0:01:06,426
presentation, animation and

33
00:01:06,426 --> 0:01:07,706
gestures to UIKit.

34
00:01:08,056 --> 0:01:09,186
Through the presentviewcontroller

35
00:01:09,186 --> 0:01:10,636
animated API.

36
00:01:11,616 --> 0:01:12,426
Well, with the enhancement to

37
00:01:12,426 --> 0:01:14,876
multitasking, we can push this

38
00:01:14,876 --> 0:01:16,316
delegation model to the next

39
00:01:16,316 --> 0:01:16,586
level.

40
00:01:16,876 --> 0:01:18,656
And gain powerful new features

41
00:01:18,656 --> 0:01:19,106
for free.

42
00:01:19,686 --> 0:01:20,936
Taxes may apply at checkout.

43
00:01:22,246 --> 0:01:23,886
So, we did start by adding an

44
00:01:23,886 --> 0:01:25,556
"open in new window" button in

45
00:01:25,556 --> 0:01:26,216
the data view.

46
00:01:27,156 --> 0:01:29,126
So, that all our users are going

47
00:01:29,126 --> 0:01:30,446
to be able to discover this

48
00:01:30,446 --> 0:01:31,106
great new feature.

49
00:01:31,846 --> 0:01:33,976
When tapped, we call new request

50
00:01:33,976 --> 0:01:36,716
scene session activation API, to

51
00:01:36,716 --> 0:01:38,666
open this clown in an auxiliary

52
00:01:38,776 --> 0:01:39,616
dedicated window.

53
00:01:40,156 --> 0:01:41,686
Let's do that.

54
00:01:41,886 --> 0:01:43,546
Already, I can keep browsing my

55
00:01:43,546 --> 0:01:44,926
map and checking out and

56
00:01:44,926 --> 0:01:46,146
comparing other clowns.

57
00:01:46,836 --> 0:01:48,606
But not only that, we can now

58
00:01:48,606 --> 0:01:50,466
have the whole system working

59
00:01:50,466 --> 0:01:51,026
for us.

60
00:01:51,576 --> 0:01:54,156
We can resize the windows, move

61
00:01:54,156 --> 0:01:54,776
them around.

62
00:01:55,816 --> 0:01:57,646
Keep opening new windows.

63
00:01:58,056 --> 0:01:59,416
And the one I had on my side, is

64
00:01:59,416 --> 0:02:00,546
now in its own space in the

65
00:01:59,416 --> 0:02:00,546
now in its own space in the

66
00:02:00,546 --> 0:02:00,906
switcher.

67
00:02:01,806 --> 0:02:03,396
Now, I can make this one a slide

68
00:02:03,396 --> 0:02:06,216
over, move it around, stash it.

69
00:02:06,866 --> 0:02:09,306
And maybe opening another couple

70
00:02:09,306 --> 0:02:13,876
details, Crusty and a last one,

71
00:02:15,416 --> 0:02:17,536
Mr. Happy here.

72
00:02:18,356 --> 0:02:20,816
Okay, so, with the swipe app, I

73
00:02:20,816 --> 0:02:22,526
can check out my whole stack of

74
00:02:22,526 --> 0:02:23,276
slide overs.

75
00:02:23,716 --> 0:02:25,466
And I can even quickly swipe

76
00:02:25,466 --> 0:02:26,676
through them all, just like

77
00:02:26,676 --> 0:02:26,896
that.

78
00:02:26,956 --> 0:02:28,886
I can even go back from being a

79
00:02:28,886 --> 0:02:30,216
slide over, to being next to the

80
00:02:30,216 --> 0:02:30,766
map again.

81
00:02:31,366 --> 0:02:32,486
Now, let's pause for a second.

82
00:02:32,816 --> 0:02:34,346
We did achieve all of these,

83
00:02:34,406 --> 0:02:35,606
again, by delegating,

84
00:02:35,606 --> 0:02:37,296
presentation, animation and

85
00:02:37,296 --> 0:02:38,816
more, to the system.

86
00:02:39,166 --> 0:02:40,756
So far, through the single

87
00:02:40,826 --> 0:02:42,546
request scene session activation

88
00:02:43,686 --> 0:02:43,786
API.

89
00:02:44,166 --> 0:02:45,856
Now, I only now noticed that Mr.

90
00:02:45,856 --> 0:02:47,396
Happy here has got a one-star

91
00:02:47,396 --> 0:02:47,706
rating.

92
00:02:48,196 --> 0:02:49,716
Probably not a good clown.

93
00:02:50,116 --> 0:02:51,506
So, let's get rid of him and his

94
00:02:51,506 --> 0:02:53,516
window, through new request

95
00:02:53,576 --> 0:02:55,326
scene session destruction API,

96
00:02:55,816 --> 0:02:56,896
which I'm calling for the upper

97
00:02:56,896 --> 0:02:58,116
right down button here.

98
00:02:58,496 --> 0:02:58,976
Let's do that.

99
00:02:58,976 --> 0:03:00,896
And he's gone for good.

100
00:02:58,976 --> 0:03:00,896
And he's gone for good.

101
00:03:01,126 --> 0:03:02,506
Now, I remembered the one I had

102
00:03:02,506 --> 0:03:03,896
in my switcher, had a five-star

103
00:03:03,896 --> 0:03:04,176
rating.

104
00:03:04,336 --> 0:03:06,236
So, let me open her again.

105
00:03:07,606 --> 0:03:09,136
Notice how she wasn't

106
00:03:09,296 --> 0:03:09,856
duplicated.

107
00:03:10,286 --> 0:03:11,496
This is Clown Town policy.

108
00:03:11,496 --> 0:03:13,406
And it's easily enforced, just

109
00:03:13,406 --> 0:03:15,056
by asking the request session

110
00:03:15,056 --> 0:03:16,836
activation API to activate and

111
00:03:16,836 --> 0:03:18,166
existing session instead of a

112
00:03:18,166 --> 0:03:18,526
new one.

113
00:03:19,656 --> 0:03:21,516
I can even track her

114
00:03:21,516 --> 0:03:22,156
availability.

115
00:03:22,446 --> 0:03:23,726
She was checked and found

116
00:03:23,726 --> 0:03:25,056
available, as I can tell from

117
00:03:25,056 --> 0:03:26,456
the green navigation bar.

118
00:03:26,746 --> 0:03:29,136
Also, an instant book button did

119
00:03:29,136 --> 0:03:31,556
appear on the left side.

120
00:03:31,896 --> 0:03:33,336
If her availability were to

121
00:03:33,336 --> 0:03:34,586
change, I will get a

122
00:03:34,586 --> 0:03:35,446
notification.

123
00:03:35,446 --> 0:03:36,956
I will update this UI to have

124
00:03:36,956 --> 0:03:38,656
the navigation bar now in red.

125
00:03:39,116 --> 0:03:41,216
And I will call the new request

126
00:03:41,216 --> 0:03:43,706
scene session refresh API, to

127
00:03:43,706 --> 0:03:46,056
update, beside other things, the

128
00:03:46,056 --> 0:03:48,166
snapshot of this UI, for it to

129
00:03:48,166 --> 0:03:49,656
be represented in the switchers.

130
00:03:50,526 --> 0:03:52,336
But I did not decide yet.

131
00:03:52,336 --> 0:03:54,996
So, let us instead start

132
00:03:55,066 --> 0:03:57,266
tracking them all, just like

133
00:03:57,266 --> 0:03:57,586
this.

134
00:03:58,736 --> 0:04:00,626
Say now that I do background the

135
00:03:58,736 --> 0:04:00,626
Say now that I do background the

136
00:04:00,626 --> 0:04:01,986
app, to do something else.

137
00:04:02,036 --> 0:04:03,486
Maybe recommend this app to my

138
00:04:03,486 --> 0:04:03,946
friends.

139
00:04:04,326 --> 0:04:06,016
And show the current collection

140
00:04:06,016 --> 0:04:06,636
I have right now.

141
00:04:07,556 --> 0:04:09,276
But I'm getting notifications

142
00:04:09,276 --> 0:04:09,586
already.

143
00:04:09,856 --> 0:04:11,196
A bunch of them are no longer

144
00:04:11,196 --> 0:04:11,606
available.

145
00:04:12,176 --> 0:04:13,286
I cannot recall their names.

146
00:04:13,286 --> 0:04:15,356
So, let me instead use app

147
00:04:15,356 --> 0:04:17,216
expose, to glance at all my

148
00:04:17,216 --> 0:04:18,106
windows at once.

149
00:04:18,676 --> 0:04:19,476
And there we go.

150
00:04:19,856 --> 0:04:21,346
Their snapshots were updated,

151
00:04:21,495 --> 0:04:22,186
which is great.

152
00:04:22,376 --> 0:04:23,696
Because I can manage my window

153
00:04:23,696 --> 0:04:24,786
right here and there.

154
00:04:25,006 --> 0:04:26,586
A couple of swipe ups and I'm

155
00:04:27,606 --> 0:04:27,696
done.

156
00:04:27,936 --> 0:04:28,956
Looks like these clowns are

157
00:04:28,956 --> 0:04:29,776
running out fast.

158
00:04:29,846 --> 0:04:31,606
So, let me go ahead and book the

159
00:04:31,606 --> 0:04:33,366
great BuBu LuBu, so we can go

160
00:04:33,366 --> 0:04:34,466
back to our party.

161
00:04:35,916 --> 0:04:38,816
Oops, see you later Clown Town.

162
00:04:39,686 --> 0:04:40,456
Okay, so...

163
00:04:41,016 --> 0:04:42,506
[ Applause ]

164
00:04:42,506 --> 0:04:42,746
Thank you.

165
00:04:43,111 --> 0:04:45,111
[ Applause ]

166
00:04:45,206 --> 0:04:46,296
So, let's check out the API's,

167
00:04:46,986 --> 0:04:47,996
activating a session.

168
00:04:48,526 --> 0:04:50,736
First of all, you activate a

169
00:04:50,736 --> 0:04:52,336
session only in response to

170
00:04:52,336 --> 0:04:53,756
direct and local user

171
00:04:53,756 --> 0:04:54,336
interaction.

172
00:04:55,006 --> 0:04:56,876
The user has to touch the screen

173
00:04:57,306 --> 0:04:59,976
for it to happen.

174
00:04:59,976 --> 0:05:01,106
And you do so by calling the new

175
00:04:59,976 --> 0:05:01,106
And you do so by calling the new

176
00:05:01,106 --> 0:05:02,656
request scene session activation

177
00:05:02,656 --> 0:05:04,466
API on UI application.

178
00:05:04,756 --> 0:05:06,216
To either activate an existing

179
00:05:06,216 --> 0:05:07,326
session or a new one.

180
00:05:08,736 --> 0:05:10,336
Now, in Clown Town, when we

181
00:05:10,336 --> 0:05:12,026
first launched, UIApplication

182
00:05:12,026 --> 0:05:14,186
had just one open session.

183
00:05:14,676 --> 0:05:15,666
The one with our map

184
00:05:15,666 --> 0:05:16,336
configuration.

185
00:05:17,966 --> 0:05:19,916
All in just window, displaying

186
00:05:19,916 --> 0:05:21,006
our whole view hierarchy.

187
00:05:21,586 --> 0:05:23,656
When the open a new window

188
00:05:23,656 --> 0:05:25,286
button was pressed, through

189
00:05:25,286 --> 0:05:26,706
delegation, the detail view

190
00:05:26,706 --> 0:05:28,246
controller gets to the map view

191
00:05:28,246 --> 0:05:29,526
controller, which is presenting

192
00:05:29,526 --> 0:05:29,646
it.

193
00:05:30,336 --> 0:05:31,776
And the map view controller

194
00:05:31,826 --> 0:05:33,716
calls this method that we added

195
00:05:33,906 --> 0:05:35,186
on our application delegate.

196
00:05:36,136 --> 0:05:38,406
Here, since we have the no

197
00:05:38,406 --> 0:05:40,036
duplicate policy, we check for

198
00:05:40,096 --> 0:05:41,906
any existing session for this

199
00:05:41,906 --> 0:05:42,486
given clown.

200
00:05:43,076 --> 0:05:44,376
Now, on first launch, we won't

201
00:05:44,376 --> 0:05:44,886
find any.

202
00:05:45,016 --> 0:05:45,946
So, we're going to end up

203
00:05:46,016 --> 0:05:47,616
passing nil here, at runtime.

204
00:05:48,196 --> 0:05:49,386
Pass nil here, to this

205
00:05:49,386 --> 0:05:51,506
parameter, requests a brand-new

206
00:05:51,506 --> 0:05:53,126
scene session to be created.

207
00:05:53,756 --> 0:05:55,856
We then create a userActivity

208
00:05:55,856 --> 0:05:56,576
for this clown.

209
00:05:56,696 --> 0:05:58,336
And the userActivity is going to

210
00:05:58,336 --> 0:06:00,866
be given back to us by UIKit,

211
00:05:58,336 --> 0:06:00,866
be given back to us by UIKit,

212
00:06:01,566 --> 0:06:03,666
later on along the delegate

213
00:06:03,666 --> 0:06:04,656
chain, as we'll see.

214
00:06:05,876 --> 0:06:07,356
The options objects, let's me

215
00:06:07,356 --> 0:06:08,776
specify a requesting scene,

216
00:06:09,176 --> 0:06:10,936
which is meant to be the one

217
00:06:10,936 --> 0:06:12,526
where this request was user

218
00:06:12,596 --> 0:06:13,256
initiated.

219
00:06:13,816 --> 0:06:15,596
The system uses this information

220
00:06:15,596 --> 0:06:17,276
to avoid replacing the

221
00:06:17,466 --> 0:06:18,856
requestingScene with the

222
00:06:18,856 --> 0:06:19,686
activated one.

223
00:06:20,306 --> 0:06:21,416
And for other navigation

224
00:06:21,416 --> 0:06:21,896
purposes.

225
00:06:22,876 --> 0:06:23,906
We can now call the API.

226
00:06:25,206 --> 0:06:26,276
The new window is shown.

227
00:06:26,476 --> 0:06:28,046
And alongside, a new session

228
00:06:28,046 --> 0:06:29,336
hierarchy has been created.

229
00:06:30,556 --> 0:06:32,616
As I mentioned, there are two

230
00:06:32,726 --> 0:06:34,116
key delicate methods you

231
00:06:34,206 --> 0:06:35,636
definitely want to implement, in

232
00:06:35,636 --> 0:06:37,516
order for your app to have a say

233
00:06:37,516 --> 0:06:39,286
in what actually gets created.

234
00:06:39,366 --> 0:06:40,596
And how it gets configured.

235
00:06:41,776 --> 0:06:43,826
So, let's step back and go back

236
00:06:43,826 --> 0:06:45,376
to when we called the API.

237
00:06:45,376 --> 0:06:49,536
As soon as we do so, UIKit

238
00:06:49,756 --> 0:06:51,026
creates a brand-new scene

239
00:06:51,026 --> 0:06:51,386
session.

240
00:06:51,586 --> 0:06:53,126
And let's you specify a

241
00:06:53,126 --> 0:06:54,846
configuration for it, by calling

242
00:06:55,116 --> 0:06:56,466
configuration for connecting

243
00:06:56,466 --> 0:06:57,896
scene session on your app

244
00:06:58,066 --> 0:06:58,456
delegate.

245
00:06:58,766 --> 0:06:59,836
You definitely want to implement

246
00:06:59,836 --> 0:07:00,196
this one.

247
00:06:59,836 --> 0:07:00,196
this one.

248
00:07:00,506 --> 0:07:02,296
And here, you can inspect the

249
00:07:02,296 --> 0:07:03,156
user activity.

250
00:07:03,516 --> 0:07:05,136
Which is given back to you now

251
00:07:05,136 --> 0:07:06,486
through the UI scene connecting

252
00:07:06,486 --> 0:07:08,756
options, to pick a session.

253
00:07:09,146 --> 0:07:12,586
In my case, it's the detail

254
00:07:12,726 --> 0:07:13,376
configuration.

255
00:07:14,216 --> 0:07:15,706
Now, if your configuration

256
00:07:15,706 --> 0:07:17,556
specifies a storyboard, as I do

257
00:07:17,556 --> 0:07:18,036
recommend.

258
00:07:18,266 --> 0:07:19,916
At this point, UIKit is able to

259
00:07:19,916 --> 0:07:21,086
go ahead and create the whole

260
00:07:21,086 --> 0:07:21,646
view hierarchy.

261
00:07:21,646 --> 0:07:23,386
And you just need to configure

262
00:07:23,386 --> 0:07:23,976
that.

263
00:07:24,226 --> 0:07:25,556
You do so by implementing

264
00:07:25,556 --> 0:07:27,186
scenewillConnectToSession on

265
00:07:27,186 --> 0:07:28,026
your scene delegate.

266
00:07:28,886 --> 0:07:30,006
In there again, you'll be able

267
00:07:30,006 --> 0:07:31,476
to find your user activity and

268
00:07:31,476 --> 0:07:32,416
the connecting options.

269
00:07:32,886 --> 0:07:34,416
And you configure your window

270
00:07:34,416 --> 0:07:35,646
and view controller hierarchy

271
00:07:35,746 --> 0:07:36,726
for it.

272
00:07:38,316 --> 0:07:39,996
Now, that was a new session.

273
00:07:40,126 --> 0:07:41,606
What about an existing session?

274
00:07:42,676 --> 0:07:44,516
If the session is still is

275
00:07:44,516 --> 0:07:46,306
existing, we go straight to the

276
00:07:46,306 --> 0:07:47,046
scene delegate.

277
00:07:47,236 --> 0:07:49,016
And if the session had been

278
00:07:49,016 --> 0:07:50,866
disconnected in the meantime, we

279
00:07:50,866 --> 0:07:52,506
call sceneWillConnectToSession.

280
00:07:53,576 --> 0:07:54,946
But if the scene is still

281
00:07:54,946 --> 0:07:56,616
connected, we'll just go to the

282
00:07:56,616 --> 0:07:58,286
continueUserActivity one.

283
00:07:58,416 --> 0:08:00,436
You definitely want to implement

284
00:07:58,416 --> 0:08:00,436
You definitely want to implement

285
00:08:00,436 --> 0:08:00,636
those.

286
00:08:01,456 --> 0:08:03,456
To recap, you activate a

287
00:08:03,456 --> 0:08:04,886
session, only in response to

288
00:08:04,886 --> 0:08:06,286
direct user request.

289
00:08:06,416 --> 0:08:08,726
To either activate a new or

290
00:08:08,726 --> 0:08:09,616
existing session.

291
00:08:10,146 --> 0:08:12,516
And you want to implement your

292
00:08:12,516 --> 0:08:14,156
app and scene delegates methods,

293
00:08:14,326 --> 0:08:16,116
to be able to configure both

294
00:08:16,246 --> 0:08:18,296
session and the window for the

295
00:08:18,296 --> 0:08:20,856
activity at hand.

296
00:08:20,966 --> 0:08:22,676
Now, onto refreshing a session.

297
00:08:23,586 --> 0:08:25,266
You refresh for user-relevant

298
00:08:25,266 --> 0:08:26,436
updates from your app.

299
00:08:26,436 --> 0:08:28,306
A couple of examples.

300
00:08:28,516 --> 0:08:29,966
It could be that you have

301
00:08:30,076 --> 0:08:32,256
multiple windows showing and

302
00:08:32,256 --> 0:08:34,346
working on the same assets.

303
00:08:34,506 --> 0:08:36,106
And the user may have modified

304
00:08:36,106 --> 0:08:38,436
them from a window or even

305
00:08:38,496 --> 0:08:39,306
another device.

306
00:08:39,306 --> 0:08:40,446
And now you want to keep them in

307
00:08:40,446 --> 0:08:40,826
sync.

308
00:08:40,926 --> 0:08:41,916
You want to have their

309
00:08:41,916 --> 0:08:43,525
presentation being updated in

310
00:08:43,525 --> 0:08:45,116
these features and more.

311
00:08:45,876 --> 0:08:47,906
Or you just fetched new data and

312
00:08:47,906 --> 0:08:49,646
it is available for the user to

313
00:08:49,646 --> 0:08:50,126
be seen.

314
00:08:50,556 --> 0:08:52,286
Or you want to update some scene

315
00:08:52,286 --> 0:08:53,746
and session metadata, as we'll

316
00:08:53,746 --> 0:08:53,976
see.

317
00:08:55,376 --> 0:08:57,016
You do so by calling at any

318
00:08:57,016 --> 0:08:57,706
time, the

319
00:08:57,706 --> 0:08:59,856
requestSceneSessionRefresh API

320
00:09:00,226 --> 0:09:01,196
on UIApplication.

321
00:09:02,296 --> 0:09:04,576
By just passing in the session you

322
00:09:04,576 --> 0:09:05,866
wish to be refreshed.

323
00:09:07,716 --> 0:09:10,126
Now, what is it actually that

324
00:09:10,126 --> 0:09:12,056
this API affords you to update?

325
00:09:12,646 --> 0:09:14,776
You can update the state

326
00:09:14,776 --> 0:09:16,436
restoration user activity for

327
00:09:16,436 --> 0:09:16,996
the session.

328
00:09:17,416 --> 0:09:18,676
You can update the scene

329
00:09:18,786 --> 0:09:20,046
activation conditions.

330
00:09:20,536 --> 0:09:23,116
And your UI, which is eventually

331
00:09:23,186 --> 0:09:24,396
going to be captured in a

332
00:09:24,396 --> 0:09:25,256
snapshot, again.

333
00:09:26,106 --> 0:09:28,416
As we saw in Clown Town, thanks

334
00:09:28,466 --> 0:09:30,256
to those updated snapshots, the

335
00:09:30,256 --> 0:09:31,866
app felt alive in the switcher.

336
00:09:32,216 --> 0:09:33,956
And we were able to confidently

337
00:09:33,956 --> 0:09:35,166
act on the incoming data.

338
00:09:35,706 --> 0:09:37,396
Without having to navigate to

339
00:09:37,506 --> 0:09:39,016
each and every session, just to

340
00:09:39,016 --> 0:09:40,796
find out, once connected and

341
00:09:40,796 --> 0:09:42,206
updated, that we didn't even

342
00:09:42,206 --> 0:09:42,886
want them anymore.

343
00:09:43,496 --> 0:09:47,426
On an architectural note, you

344
00:09:47,426 --> 0:09:48,996
want to listen for rare model

345
00:09:48,996 --> 0:09:50,226
changes for which you want to

346
00:09:50,226 --> 0:09:50,956
call the API.

347
00:09:51,446 --> 0:09:52,886
Both in the interested view

348
00:09:52,886 --> 0:09:54,676
controller, as well as in a

349
00:09:54,676 --> 0:09:55,576
long-lived object.

350
00:09:56,656 --> 0:09:58,296
Because if the scene is still

351
00:09:58,296 --> 0:10:00,676
connected, either in the

352
00:09:58,296 --> 0:10:00,676
connected, either in the

353
00:10:00,676 --> 0:10:01,856
foreground or the background, it

354
00:10:01,856 --> 0:10:03,666
can listen to the notification

355
00:10:03,666 --> 0:10:03,976
itself.

356
00:10:04,046 --> 0:10:05,736
And call the API, which is going

357
00:10:05,846 --> 0:10:07,306
to do the right thing

358
00:10:07,396 --> 0:10:07,936
internally.

359
00:10:08,966 --> 0:10:10,946
If the scene has been

360
00:10:10,946 --> 0:10:12,246
disconnected though, the view

361
00:10:12,246 --> 0:10:13,336
controller won't be there

362
00:10:13,336 --> 0:10:13,646
anymore.

363
00:10:14,196 --> 0:10:15,666
And so, the long-lived object

364
00:10:15,786 --> 0:10:17,946
can step in, figure that out and

365
00:10:17,946 --> 0:10:19,956
call to refresh API in its

366
00:10:19,956 --> 0:10:20,396
place.

367
00:10:21,056 --> 0:10:22,646
The scene is going then to be

368
00:10:22,726 --> 0:10:23,636
background connected.

369
00:10:23,976 --> 0:10:25,336
And the view controller will

370
00:10:25,336 --> 0:10:27,016
have a chance to update itself.

371
00:10:27,516 --> 0:10:29,076
And the snapshot will be

372
00:10:29,076 --> 0:10:29,476
captured.

373
00:10:30,036 --> 0:10:33,196
As a summary, you want to

374
00:10:33,196 --> 0:10:34,896
refresh for user relevant

375
00:10:34,896 --> 0:10:36,006
updates from your app.

376
00:10:36,946 --> 0:10:39,346
Make your layout time fast, so

377
00:10:39,346 --> 0:10:40,716
that we can quickly capture the

378
00:10:40,716 --> 0:10:41,216
snapshot.

379
00:10:41,846 --> 0:10:43,956
And do not rely on it being

380
00:10:43,956 --> 0:10:45,136
executed immediately.

381
00:10:45,446 --> 0:10:46,736
The system reserves the ability

382
00:10:46,886 --> 0:10:48,296
to fulfill this request at a

383
00:10:48,296 --> 0:10:49,376
later point in time, if

384
00:10:49,376 --> 0:10:49,906
necessary.

385
00:10:51,116 --> 0:10:53,526
Now, destroying a session, also

386
00:10:53,526 --> 0:10:55,456
known as going away with style.

387
00:10:56,556 --> 0:10:59,886
You destroy a session for direct

388
00:11:00,106 --> 0:11:00,856
user request.

389
00:11:01,086 --> 0:11:02,646
Or if you have a window, which

390
00:11:02,646 --> 0:11:04,606
is an auxiliary window dedicated

391
00:11:04,606 --> 0:11:05,916
to show a piece of data, an

392
00:11:05,916 --> 0:11:07,696
item, that the user already

393
00:11:07,696 --> 0:11:09,146
deleted from somewhere else.

394
00:11:09,146 --> 0:11:10,876
Another window or even another

395
00:11:10,876 --> 0:11:11,386
device.

396
00:11:11,896 --> 0:11:14,476
You do so by calling, at any

397
00:11:14,476 --> 0:11:15,386
time, the

398
00:11:15,386 --> 0:11:17,036
requestSceneSessionDestruction

399
00:11:17,036 --> 0:11:18,476
API, on UIApplication.

400
00:11:18,826 --> 0:11:20,216
Which takes in the session you

401
00:11:20,216 --> 0:11:21,106
wish to be destroyed.

402
00:11:21,106 --> 0:11:23,646
As well as an options object.

403
00:11:24,256 --> 0:11:26,516
This option lets you specify a

404
00:11:26,516 --> 0:11:27,606
DismissalAnimation.

405
00:11:28,416 --> 0:11:29,776
Which the system is going to

406
00:11:29,776 --> 0:11:32,086
take into account, if the scene

407
00:11:32,146 --> 0:11:33,756
happens to be foreground at that

408
00:11:33,756 --> 0:11:34,086
moment.

409
00:11:35,156 --> 0:11:36,626
Now, let me be clear, the

410
00:11:36,626 --> 0:11:38,726
session is going to go away and

411
00:11:38,726 --> 0:11:39,556
won't come back.

412
00:11:40,056 --> 0:11:41,946
But the animation lets you

413
00:11:41,946 --> 0:11:44,006
acknowledge the user's intent in

414
00:11:44,006 --> 0:11:44,666
getting rid of it.

415
00:11:45,576 --> 0:11:46,776
So, which one to pick, then?

416
00:11:47,376 --> 0:11:49,026
The main draft is a great

417
00:11:49,096 --> 0:11:49,536
paradigm.

418
00:11:50,266 --> 0:11:51,826
When the main draft is

419
00:11:51,876 --> 0:11:53,356
cancelled, without saving, the

420
00:11:53,626 --> 0:11:55,556
user is explicitly asking for

421
00:11:55,556 --> 0:11:56,706
its content to be destroyed.

422
00:11:57,166 --> 0:11:58,336
Which is the common case, when

423
00:11:58,386 --> 0:11:59,626
getting rid of a window, as we

424
00:11:59,626 --> 0:12:00,356
saw in Clown Town.

425
00:11:59,626 --> 0:12:00,356
saw in Clown Town.

426
00:12:01,086 --> 0:12:02,626
You pick the standard animation,

427
00:12:02,626 --> 0:12:05,236
in these cases, to acknowledge

428
00:12:05,426 --> 0:12:05,966
this intent.

429
00:12:06,566 --> 0:12:09,796
When to draft the assent, the

430
00:12:09,796 --> 0:12:11,646
user is not asking for his

431
00:12:11,646 --> 0:12:12,576
content to be destroyed.

432
00:12:13,276 --> 0:12:14,416
The session though, will be

433
00:12:14,416 --> 0:12:15,866
destroyed as a side effect of

434
00:12:15,946 --> 0:12:17,716
the user accepting the final

435
00:12:17,716 --> 0:12:19,096
purpose of the session.

436
00:12:19,506 --> 0:12:21,256
Which, in the mail case, is

437
00:12:21,316 --> 0:12:22,126
sending the e-mail.

438
00:12:22,506 --> 0:12:23,816
In the Clown Town case, was

439
00:12:23,906 --> 0:12:25,296
booking the clown, if you are in

440
00:12:25,296 --> 0:12:25,866
tracking mode.

441
00:12:26,846 --> 0:12:28,426
You pick commit to acknowledge

442
00:12:28,726 --> 0:12:29,886
that the final purpose of the

443
00:12:29,886 --> 0:12:32,316
session has been approved by the

444
00:12:32,316 --> 0:12:32,686
user.

445
00:12:34,126 --> 0:12:36,996
Now, when the draft is cancelled

446
00:12:37,736 --> 0:12:39,866
and saved, the user again, is

447
00:12:39,976 --> 0:12:41,396
not asking for his content to be

448
00:12:41,396 --> 0:12:41,806
destroyed.

449
00:12:42,356 --> 0:12:43,466
The session though, will be

450
00:12:43,466 --> 0:12:45,036
destroyed as a side effect of

451
00:12:45,036 --> 0:12:47,096
the user declining from taking

452
00:12:47,096 --> 0:12:48,206
action right now.

453
00:12:49,136 --> 0:12:50,086
You pick decline, in these

454
00:12:50,086 --> 0:12:51,506
cases, to acknowledge that the

455
00:12:51,506 --> 0:12:53,516
final purpose of the session has

456
00:12:53,516 --> 0:12:55,106
not been fulfilled yet.

457
00:12:58,436 --> 0:13:01,166
To recap, you destroy a session

458
00:12:58,436 --> 0:13:01,166
To recap, you destroy a session

459
00:13:01,256 --> 0:13:02,736
in response to user request.

460
00:13:02,846 --> 0:13:04,476
Either locally or remotely.

461
00:13:04,726 --> 0:13:06,136
And you pick the animation style

462
00:13:06,536 --> 0:13:07,986
to best acknowledge the user's

463
00:13:07,986 --> 0:13:10,166
intent in getting rid of it.

464
00:13:10,736 --> 0:13:12,846
To recap, we've seen how through

465
00:13:12,846 --> 0:13:14,846
these new API's, you can empower

466
00:13:14,936 --> 0:13:16,096
your user's actions.

467
00:13:16,596 --> 0:13:18,966
And you can delegate complexity

468
00:13:19,016 --> 0:13:20,396
to the system, while gaining

469
00:13:20,476 --> 0:13:22,616
powerful new features, easily

470
00:13:22,616 --> 0:13:24,586
discoverable by all your users.

471
00:13:24,666 --> 0:13:24,976
Thank you.
