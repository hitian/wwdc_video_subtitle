2
00:00:10,056 --> 0:00:11,296
&gt;&gt; Good morning everyone.

3
00:00:11,376 --> 0:00:13,776
And thank you for joining our

4
00:00:13,776 --> 0:00:14,226
session.

5
00:00:14,886 --> 0:00:16,396
My name is David Lui, and I'm

6
00:00:16,396 --> 0:00:18,476
thrilled to be back here at WWDC

7
00:00:18,556 --> 0:00:20,816
to share with you all the new

8
00:00:20,816 --> 0:00:22,876
and exciting features in AR

9
00:00:22,876 --> 0:00:23,686
Quick Look.

10
00:00:25,016 --> 0:00:27,386
Last year, with iOS 12, we

11
00:00:27,386 --> 0:00:29,076
introduced AR Quick Look, which

12
00:00:29,076 --> 0:00:30,776
set the foundation and provided

13
00:00:30,776 --> 0:00:33,066
a great single-model AR

14
00:00:33,126 --> 0:00:34,496
previewing experience.

15
00:00:35,166 --> 0:00:36,706
We made it really easy to

16
00:00:36,706 --> 0:00:38,796
experience 3D content in your

17
00:00:38,796 --> 0:00:41,106
world in an immersive and

18
00:00:41,106 --> 0:00:43,376
realistic way using physically

19
00:00:43,376 --> 0:00:44,176
based rendering.

20
00:00:44,736 --> 0:00:47,416
AR Quick Look is built in as

21
00:00:47,456 --> 0:00:49,736
part of iOS and is available on

22
00:00:49,736 --> 0:00:52,456
the web and in many applications

23
00:00:52,566 --> 0:00:54,446
like messages and Apple News.

24
00:00:55,826 --> 0:00:57,166
We gave a session last year

25
00:00:57,166 --> 0:00:58,236
where you could learn more about

26
00:00:58,236 --> 0:00:59,586
how to integrate AR Quick Look

27
00:01:00,216 --> 0:01:01,876
into your application and

28
00:01:01,926 --> 0:01:04,436
website along with how to create

29
00:01:04,436 --> 0:01:06,266
great-looking content for it.

30
00:01:07,456 --> 0:01:09,096
So, in this session, we'll go

31
00:01:09,096 --> 0:01:10,096
over our integration with

32
00:01:10,096 --> 0:01:11,836
Reality Composer and how AR

33
00:01:11,836 --> 0:01:13,346
Quick Look views the produced

34
00:01:13,346 --> 0:01:16,326
content, improvements to the

35
00:01:16,326 --> 0:01:19,026
visual rendering, and experience

36
00:01:19,026 --> 0:01:20,606
within AR Quick Look for greater

37
00:01:20,606 --> 0:01:22,596
realism and content immersion.

38
00:01:24,006 --> 0:01:25,206
Along with how to support all

39
00:01:25,206 --> 0:01:27,096
these new features on the web

40
00:01:27,546 --> 0:01:28,696
including customizing the

41
00:01:28,696 --> 0:01:30,626
preview and experience for your

42
00:01:30,626 --> 0:01:33,656
applications, and lastly, our

43
00:01:33,656 --> 0:01:35,606
enhanced integration with retail

44
00:01:35,606 --> 0:01:37,096
with support for call to action

45
00:01:37,426 --> 0:01:40,076
and Apple Pay.

46
00:01:40,296 --> 0:01:41,716
So, earlier in the week, we

47
00:01:41,716 --> 0:01:43,306
talked about Reality Kit and

48
00:01:43,306 --> 0:01:45,886
Reality Composer, our new macOS

49
00:01:45,956 --> 0:01:48,676
and iOS tool for simple AR-based

50
00:01:48,936 --> 0:01:50,766
content creation, where we can

51
00:01:50,766 --> 0:01:52,916
quickly create really amazing,

52
00:01:53,086 --> 0:01:55,796
rich content with activity for

53
00:01:55,796 --> 0:01:56,356
applications.

54
00:01:57,236 --> 0:01:59,756
You can take all that same rich

55
00:01:59,756 --> 0:02:00,706
content and share them through

56
00:01:59,756 --> 0:02:00,706
content and share them through

57
00:02:00,706 --> 0:02:02,626
various applications, all of

58
00:02:02,626 --> 0:02:04,666
which can be viewed in AR Quick

59
00:02:04,666 --> 0:02:04,936
Look.

60
00:02:05,766 --> 0:02:06,786
It's a really great way to

61
00:02:06,786 --> 0:02:08,346
easily realize these new

62
00:02:08,346 --> 0:02:10,506
interactive experiences and view

63
00:02:10,506 --> 0:02:11,686
them in a feature-rich

64
00:02:11,686 --> 0:02:13,456
environment all by simply

65
00:02:13,456 --> 0:02:15,056
sharing the 3D model file.

66
00:02:15,056 --> 0:02:18,366
And we really mean feature rich.

67
00:02:18,836 --> 0:02:20,716
In support of Reality Kit and

68
00:02:20,716 --> 0:02:22,686
Reality Composer, we added new

69
00:02:22,686 --> 0:02:24,146
rendering effects to AR Quick

70
00:02:24,146 --> 0:02:25,716
Look like dynamic ray-traced

71
00:02:25,716 --> 0:02:27,706
shadows and people occlusion to

72
00:02:27,706 --> 0:02:29,646
help improve the realism of 3D

73
00:02:29,646 --> 0:02:31,216
content placed in your world.

74
00:02:32,576 --> 0:02:33,736
We've also added a lot more

75
00:02:33,736 --> 0:02:35,196
capabilities, like multimodel

76
00:02:35,196 --> 0:02:36,846
support and a built-in animation

77
00:02:36,846 --> 0:02:38,616
scrubber that not only enhances

78
00:02:38,616 --> 0:02:40,166
the AR experience but gives you

79
00:02:40,166 --> 0:02:42,066
more control over the content.

80
00:02:43,386 --> 0:02:44,866
Adopting AR Quick Look is the

81
00:02:44,866 --> 0:02:46,706
easiest way to take advantage of

82
00:02:46,826 --> 0:02:48,696
all these new features, to bring

83
00:02:48,696 --> 0:02:51,116
an amazing AR experience to any

84
00:02:51,116 --> 0:02:53,446
application or website and seek

85
00:02:53,446 --> 0:02:55,426
content as if it was actually

86
00:02:55,426 --> 0:02:56,256
there with you.

87
00:02:59,146 --> 0:02:59,836
So, let's get started.

88
00:03:00,976 --> 0:03:03,326
AR Quick Look is built around

89
00:03:03,326 --> 0:03:03,786
USDZ.

90
00:03:05,246 --> 0:03:06,986
Today, people create content for

91
00:03:06,986 --> 0:03:08,146
AR Quick Look using their

92
00:03:08,276 --> 0:03:10,256
favorite 3D modelling software

93
00:03:10,256 --> 0:03:13,026
and exporting that scene as a

94
00:03:13,026 --> 0:03:13,776
USDZ file.

95
00:03:15,046 --> 0:03:16,376
You can then view that content

96
00:03:16,716 --> 0:03:18,036
in AR Quick Look where you can

97
00:03:18,036 --> 0:03:19,846
push the object into your world

98
00:03:19,846 --> 0:03:20,266
to view it.

99
00:03:20,266 --> 0:03:23,656
You can take that same USDZ file

100
00:03:23,726 --> 0:03:25,436
and import it into Reality

101
00:03:25,436 --> 0:03:26,866
Composer where you can add new

102
00:03:26,866 --> 0:03:29,436
behaviors and interactivity that

103
00:03:29,436 --> 0:03:31,386
all gets packaged up in our new

104
00:03:31,386 --> 0:03:33,126
reality file format.

105
00:03:33,976 --> 0:03:35,906
AR Quick Look supports viewing

106
00:03:36,266 --> 0:03:38,086
these new reality files and is a

107
00:03:38,086 --> 0:03:39,446
great place to play with these

108
00:03:39,446 --> 0:03:40,296
experiences.

109
00:03:41,146 --> 0:03:43,426
For many users, AR Quick Look is

110
00:03:43,426 --> 0:03:45,886
the destination to explore and

111
00:03:45,886 --> 0:03:48,166
interact with 3D content as

112
00:03:48,166 --> 0:03:50,256
people share these models from

113
00:03:50,256 --> 0:03:52,646
one device to another across

114
00:03:52,646 --> 0:03:53,726
many applications.

115
00:03:55,636 --> 0:03:57,756
Scenes are the fundamental

116
00:03:57,756 --> 0:03:59,086
building blocks of reality

117
00:03:59,086 --> 0:03:59,576
files.

118
00:04:00,176 --> 0:04:01,296
A Reality Composer scene

119
00:04:01,296 --> 0:04:02,806
contains a specified anchor

120
00:04:02,806 --> 0:04:04,646
type, such as a horizontal or

121
00:04:04,646 --> 0:04:07,366
face placement, and one or more

122
00:04:07,366 --> 0:04:10,056
objects placed in the scene.

123
00:04:10,266 --> 0:04:11,666
These objects can contain any

124
00:04:11,666 --> 0:04:13,086
combination of interactive

125
00:04:13,306 --> 0:04:16,156
behaviors, captivating audio,

126
00:04:16,156 --> 0:04:17,995
and realistic physics.

127
00:04:18,916 --> 0:04:20,505
Together, this produces a really

128
00:04:20,505 --> 0:04:22,456
compelling stand-alone AR

129
00:04:22,456 --> 0:04:24,316
experience represented as a

130
00:04:24,316 --> 0:04:25,136
Reality file.

131
00:04:26,066 --> 0:04:27,586
So, let's take a closer look at

132
00:04:27,586 --> 0:04:28,456
some of these properties.

133
00:04:30,126 --> 0:04:31,676
Every scene has an anchor type,

134
00:04:32,066 --> 0:04:33,486
which describes how the model

135
00:04:33,486 --> 0:04:34,596
should be placed in the world.

136
00:04:35,276 --> 0:04:36,486
Last year, AR Quick Look

137
00:04:36,486 --> 0:04:37,966
supported horizontal anchors

138
00:04:38,196 --> 0:04:39,986
like tables, floors.

139
00:04:40,136 --> 0:04:42,436
And this year, we've added

140
00:04:42,436 --> 0:04:43,996
support for vertical surfaces

141
00:04:44,236 --> 0:04:48,026
like walls as well as faces and

142
00:04:48,026 --> 0:04:49,796
known 2D images in your

143
00:04:49,796 --> 0:04:50,356
environment.

144
00:04:52,046 --> 0:04:53,826
So, let's describe each of these

145
00:04:53,876 --> 0:04:54,416
in detail.

146
00:04:55,876 --> 0:04:57,916
Horizontal and vertical anchors

147
00:04:58,166 --> 0:04:59,936
are found in everyday settings

148
00:04:59,936 --> 0:05:01,496
such as tables and floors.

149
00:04:59,936 --> 0:05:01,496
such as tables and floors.

150
00:05:02,246 --> 0:05:04,356
Since it is so common, objects

151
00:05:04,356 --> 0:05:05,836
are placed on the first detected

152
00:05:05,836 --> 0:05:08,056
plane, and we make it really

153
00:05:08,056 --> 0:05:09,566
easy to go between different

154
00:05:09,566 --> 0:05:11,396
surfaces, just like dragging the

155
00:05:11,396 --> 0:05:13,416
model from one surface to

156
00:05:13,416 --> 0:05:13,756
another.

157
00:05:15,376 --> 0:05:16,916
Rotation gestures differ

158
00:05:16,916 --> 0:05:18,276
depending on whether the object

159
00:05:18,556 --> 0:05:20,146
is on a horizontal surface or a

160
00:05:20,146 --> 0:05:21,096
vertical surface.

161
00:05:22,486 --> 0:05:24,086
And this behavior applies for

162
00:05:24,086 --> 0:05:26,266
both reality files and USDZ

163
00:05:26,266 --> 0:05:26,666
files.

164
00:05:28,716 --> 0:05:29,566
So, let me show you how to place

165
00:05:29,566 --> 0:05:31,516
this picture frame on the wall

166
00:05:31,516 --> 0:05:32,556
starting from a horizontal

167
00:05:32,556 --> 0:05:33,106
surface.

168
00:05:33,596 --> 0:05:34,926
I'll push the frame onto this

169
00:05:34,926 --> 0:05:36,716
table, and you can then tap and

170
00:05:36,716 --> 0:05:38,586
drag the model over to the couch

171
00:05:38,826 --> 0:05:40,226
and position it onto the wall.

172
00:05:41,256 --> 0:05:42,356
You can also start looking

173
00:05:42,356 --> 0:05:43,436
directly [applause]-- thank you.

174
00:05:43,516 --> 0:05:45,706
You can also start looking

175
00:05:45,706 --> 0:05:47,836
directly at the wall and pushing

176
00:05:47,836 --> 0:05:49,166
the content from your device.

177
00:05:49,986 --> 0:05:51,956
It's a really seamless way to go

178
00:05:51,956 --> 0:05:53,146
between planes in order to

179
00:05:53,146 --> 0:05:54,736
anchor your content in the world

180
00:05:55,036 --> 0:05:56,486
as you would like.

181
00:05:57,336 --> 0:05:59,176
You can also anchor virtual

182
00:05:59,176 --> 0:06:00,816
content to real-world objects

183
00:05:59,176 --> 0:06:00,816
content to real-world objects

184
00:06:00,966 --> 0:06:01,516
that can move.

185
00:06:02,046 --> 0:06:03,416
Like putting on eyeglasses on

186
00:06:03,416 --> 0:06:04,006
your face.

187
00:06:05,026 --> 0:06:06,606
For these type of experiences,

188
00:06:06,636 --> 0:06:07,956
AR Quick Look automatically

189
00:06:07,956 --> 0:06:09,686
turns on the front camera and

190
00:06:09,686 --> 0:06:11,386
anchors the content based off of

191
00:06:11,386 --> 0:06:13,176
how it's authored relative to

192
00:06:13,176 --> 0:06:14,096
the center of your face.

193
00:06:15,556 --> 0:06:16,986
Face occlusion geometry from

194
00:06:16,986 --> 0:06:18,976
ARKit is used in AR Quick Look

195
00:06:19,146 --> 0:06:20,516
to realistically obscure the

196
00:06:20,516 --> 0:06:22,416
object position on your face so

197
00:06:22,416 --> 0:06:24,196
that they will intersect and

198
00:06:24,196 --> 0:06:26,546
break the illusion.

199
00:06:26,646 --> 0:06:28,486
Once anchored, scale and rotate

200
00:06:28,486 --> 0:06:30,556
gestures are disabled to ring

201
00:06:30,556 --> 0:06:32,456
true to their authored size and

202
00:06:32,456 --> 0:06:33,716
correctly positioned to your

203
00:06:33,716 --> 0:06:34,166
face.

204
00:06:34,956 --> 0:06:36,886
You can also take selfies with

205
00:06:36,886 --> 0:06:38,336
your friends when trying on the

206
00:06:38,336 --> 0:06:40,046
same pair of glasses in AR Quick

207
00:06:40,046 --> 0:06:42,316
Look and with ARKit 3 this year,

208
00:06:43,066 --> 0:06:45,026
there's support for up to three

209
00:06:45,646 --> 0:06:45,826
faces.

210
00:06:46,656 --> 0:06:48,176
This experience is only

211
00:06:48,176 --> 0:06:49,826
available on devices with a

212
00:06:49,826 --> 0:06:51,926
front-facing TrueDepth camera.

213
00:06:52,356 --> 0:06:55,136
And for other devices, the

214
00:06:55,136 --> 0:06:56,556
anchor is treated as if it was a

215
00:06:56,556 --> 0:06:58,046
horizontal anchor.

216
00:07:00,356 --> 0:07:01,776
So here are some examples of my

217
00:07:01,776 --> 0:07:02,986
friends trying on different

218
00:07:02,986 --> 0:07:04,136
accessories, such as a

219
00:07:04,136 --> 0:07:05,786
masquerade mask, propeller

220
00:07:05,786 --> 0:07:07,236
beanie, and this great-looking

221
00:07:07,236 --> 0:07:08,466
mustache in AR Quick Look.

222
00:07:09,126 --> 0:07:10,466
This makes the content more

223
00:07:10,466 --> 0:07:11,996
animated and really feel like

224
00:07:11,996 --> 0:07:13,716
it's part of you since it's

225
00:07:13,716 --> 0:07:15,156
interacting with using your

226
00:07:15,156 --> 0:07:15,406
face.

227
00:07:16,536 --> 0:07:17,526
It's a really great way to

228
00:07:17,606 --> 0:07:19,416
express yourself and play with

229
00:07:19,416 --> 0:07:21,326
these models in a brand-new way.

230
00:07:21,976 --> 0:07:25,556
AR Quick Look uses the front

231
00:07:25,586 --> 0:07:27,826
camera if there is a single face

232
00:07:27,826 --> 0:07:28,206
anchor.

233
00:07:28,916 --> 0:07:30,136
If there are any other scenes,

234
00:07:30,456 --> 0:07:31,626
then AR Quick Look will fall

235
00:07:31,626 --> 0:07:32,746
back treating this as a

236
00:07:32,746 --> 0:07:34,446
horizontal anchor experience.

237
00:07:35,056 --> 0:07:36,916
So, for example, say you have

238
00:07:37,106 --> 0:07:39,136
two face anchor scenes offered

239
00:07:39,136 --> 0:07:40,466
in Reality Composer like I have

240
00:07:40,466 --> 0:07:41,296
on the left-hand side.

241
00:07:42,176 --> 0:07:42,966
So there are two different

242
00:07:42,966 --> 0:07:43,656
styles of glasses.

243
00:07:44,586 --> 0:07:45,836
When previewed in AR Quick Look

244
00:07:45,836 --> 0:07:47,146
on the right-hand side, these

245
00:07:47,146 --> 0:07:48,396
glasses will be placed into the

246
00:07:48,396 --> 0:07:50,556
world as a horizontal experience

247
00:07:50,866 --> 0:07:52,176
so you can compare them side by

248
00:07:52,176 --> 0:07:52,536
side.

249
00:07:53,046 --> 0:07:56,506
Another type of dynamic anchor

250
00:07:57,006 --> 0:07:58,456
is an image anchor, where

251
00:07:58,456 --> 0:08:00,296
virtual content can track and

252
00:07:58,456 --> 0:08:00,296
virtual content can track and

253
00:08:00,296 --> 0:08:02,436
follow a real-world image.

254
00:08:03,056 --> 0:08:04,646
In AR Quick Look, we want users

255
00:08:04,646 --> 0:08:06,066
to be able to preview the scene

256
00:08:06,066 --> 0:08:07,426
in the world without having

257
00:08:07,426 --> 0:08:09,156
access to the physical image.

258
00:08:09,826 --> 0:08:12,486
So, if no anchor is detected, AR

259
00:08:12,486 --> 0:08:13,736
Quick Look will directly place

260
00:08:13,736 --> 0:08:15,006
it on the first plane that it

261
00:08:15,006 --> 0:08:15,406
finds.

262
00:08:16,426 --> 0:08:18,806
And later, when it detects the

263
00:08:18,806 --> 0:08:20,226
specified anchor, it will

264
00:08:20,226 --> 0:08:22,616
magically move over and attach

265
00:08:22,616 --> 0:08:23,526
to the real-world image.

266
00:08:25,086 --> 0:08:26,876
And finally, if the anchor

267
00:08:27,106 --> 0:08:29,246
disappears, then the scene will

268
00:08:29,246 --> 0:08:31,136
reattach to the last plane that

269
00:08:31,816 --> 0:08:33,246
it found.

270
00:08:33,635 --> 0:08:35,676
One thing to note is that

271
00:08:35,676 --> 0:08:38,116
gestures like scale and rotate

272
00:08:38,556 --> 0:08:39,206
are disabled.

273
00:08:41,676 --> 0:08:43,265
And like fixed anchors, the

274
00:08:43,265 --> 0:08:44,876
content remains true to its

275
00:08:44,876 --> 0:08:45,626
authored size.

276
00:08:46,556 --> 0:08:47,486
So, let's take a look at this

277
00:08:47,486 --> 0:08:49,216
toy rocket model I've authored

278
00:08:49,216 --> 0:08:51,146
in Reality Composer as an image

279
00:08:51,146 --> 0:08:52,046
anchor experience.

280
00:08:52,636 --> 0:08:54,556
You can see how the content is

281
00:08:54,646 --> 0:08:55,906
anchored to the real-world image

282
00:08:55,956 --> 0:08:57,296
and follows each and every

283
00:08:57,296 --> 0:09:01,166
movement whether translate or

284
00:08:57,296 --> 0:09:01,166
movement whether translate or

285
00:09:01,166 --> 0:09:01,666
rotation.

286
00:09:02,746 --> 0:09:04,446
We really encourage people to

287
00:09:04,446 --> 0:09:06,136
engage with the virtual content

288
00:09:06,246 --> 0:09:07,366
and really move around since

289
00:09:07,366 --> 0:09:09,086
this is an AR experience.

290
00:09:10,056 --> 0:09:11,186
This means directly moving the

291
00:09:11,186 --> 0:09:12,916
anchor closer to you, to

292
00:09:12,916 --> 0:09:15,036
illustrate change in scale, or

293
00:09:15,036 --> 0:09:16,656
rotating the image anchor to

294
00:09:16,656 --> 0:09:18,066
view the scene from different

295
00:09:18,066 --> 0:09:18,666
perspectives.

296
00:09:20,836 --> 0:09:22,956
Now that you've anchored content

297
00:09:23,176 --> 0:09:24,856
into your world, you can add

298
00:09:24,856 --> 0:09:26,646
behaviors to bring interactivity

299
00:09:26,796 --> 0:09:27,406
to your scene.

300
00:09:28,756 --> 0:09:30,656
Behaviors are comprised of a

301
00:09:30,656 --> 0:09:33,106
trigger and one or more actions,

302
00:09:34,846 --> 0:09:36,146
and these are all defined in the

303
00:09:36,266 --> 0:09:38,556
bottom behaviors panel in

304
00:09:38,556 --> 0:09:40,056
Reality Composer, where we can

305
00:09:40,056 --> 0:09:42,276
attach any combination of

306
00:09:42,276 --> 0:09:43,806
triggers and action sequences.

307
00:09:46,146 --> 0:09:47,436
This is a really great way to

308
00:09:47,436 --> 0:09:49,066
provide more interactivity

309
00:09:49,316 --> 0:09:51,696
between the user and the virtual

310
00:09:51,696 --> 0:09:53,586
content and create a more

311
00:09:53,586 --> 0:09:55,476
immersive and engaging user

312
00:09:55,476 --> 0:09:56,166
experience.

313
00:09:58,016 --> 0:09:59,826
So there's a variety of triggers

314
00:09:59,826 --> 0:10:01,326
and actions defined in Reality

315
00:09:59,826 --> 0:10:01,326
and actions defined in Reality

316
00:10:01,326 --> 0:10:03,006
Kit that's exposed in Reality

317
00:10:03,006 --> 0:10:04,326
Composer, and these are all

318
00:10:04,326 --> 0:10:05,896
natively supported in AR Quick

319
00:10:05,896 --> 0:10:06,096
Look.

320
00:10:07,416 --> 0:10:09,706
You can take a Tap trigger and

321
00:10:09,706 --> 0:10:10,976
attach it to your bike object

322
00:10:11,536 --> 0:10:13,016
where on tap the bike will

323
00:10:13,016 --> 0:10:15,166
disassemble, revealing all the

324
00:10:15,166 --> 0:10:16,866
individual parts and components,

325
00:10:17,426 --> 0:10:19,216
and this is all done by the Move

326
00:10:19,216 --> 0:10:19,596
action.

327
00:10:20,196 --> 0:10:22,996
You can also attach a Proximity

328
00:10:22,996 --> 0:10:25,106
trigger to a boom box where you

329
00:10:25,106 --> 0:10:26,136
can get, when you get close to

330
00:10:26,136 --> 0:10:27,946
it, music starts playing that I

331
00:10:27,946 --> 0:10:30,096
can jam to.

332
00:10:30,336 --> 0:10:32,096
One thing to note is that AR

333
00:10:32,096 --> 0:10:33,046
Quick Look does not support

334
00:10:33,086 --> 0:10:36,826
custom app actions.

335
00:10:37,176 --> 0:10:38,166
There's so many things you can

336
00:10:38,166 --> 0:10:40,396
make with this, and to learn

337
00:10:40,396 --> 0:10:41,906
more about behaviors and how to

338
00:10:42,046 --> 0:10:43,316
create interactive AR

339
00:10:43,316 --> 0:10:45,016
experiences, check out the

340
00:10:45,086 --> 0:10:46,796
Building AR Experiences with

341
00:10:46,796 --> 0:10:48,556
Reality Composer session from

342
00:10:48,556 --> 0:10:48,926
this year.

343
00:10:51,616 --> 0:10:53,666
So, all of these new features I

344
00:10:53,666 --> 0:10:55,456
described are all driven from

345
00:10:55,456 --> 0:10:56,686
this new Reality File.

346
00:10:57,586 --> 0:10:59,726
Reality File is a self-contained

347
00:10:59,816 --> 0:11:01,386
format that contains multiple

348
00:10:59,816 --> 0:11:01,386
format that contains multiple

349
00:11:01,386 --> 0:11:03,406
scenes with any number of

350
00:11:03,406 --> 0:11:05,666
objects, along with anchoring

351
00:11:05,666 --> 0:11:07,346
type information, like whether

352
00:11:07,346 --> 0:11:08,296
the content should be placed on

353
00:11:08,296 --> 0:11:10,556
a vertical wall or on a person's

354
00:11:10,556 --> 0:11:13,456
face and interactivity data with

355
00:11:13,456 --> 0:11:15,416
behaviors like tap triggers and

356
00:11:15,416 --> 0:11:18,166
audio actions for realistic and

357
00:11:18,226 --> 0:11:19,666
interact AR experience.

358
00:11:21,686 --> 0:11:23,306
Reality files work hand in hand

359
00:11:23,306 --> 0:11:25,406
with USDZ, and USDZ is the

360
00:11:25,406 --> 0:11:28,126
perfect format for sharing and

361
00:11:28,126 --> 0:11:30,316
publishing individual 3D models

362
00:11:30,586 --> 0:11:33,196
on the web or in your app for

363
00:11:33,196 --> 0:11:33,886
use in AR.

364
00:11:35,406 --> 0:11:36,406
And if you want to use these

365
00:11:36,406 --> 0:11:38,026
USDZ models you've created over

366
00:11:38,026 --> 0:11:40,226
the years, to make interactive

367
00:11:40,226 --> 0:11:41,976
AR experiences, you can combine

368
00:11:41,976 --> 0:11:43,666
them in Reality Composer and

369
00:11:43,666 --> 0:11:45,026
export out a reality file.

370
00:11:46,266 --> 0:11:48,416
Either format can be viewed in

371
00:11:48,416 --> 0:11:50,256
AR Quick Look on iOS 13.

372
00:11:51,446 --> 0:11:52,566
Now, I'd like to invite my

373
00:11:52,566 --> 0:11:53,626
colleague, Jerry, to give you a

374
00:11:53,626 --> 0:11:54,876
demo with these new experiences.

375
00:11:55,816 --> 0:11:55,966
Jerry.

376
00:11:56,516 --> 0:11:59,596
[ Applause ]

377
00:12:00,096 --> 0:12:00,556
&gt;&gt; Thanks, David.

378
00:12:01,816 --> 0:12:02,756
Good morning everyone.

379
00:12:03,066 --> 0:12:04,846
Today I am very excited to show

380
00:12:04,846 --> 0:12:06,276
you previewing Reality Files

381
00:12:06,576 --> 0:12:10,866
inside AR Quick Look.

382
00:12:11,976 --> 0:12:14,296
Now, yesterday at the Building

383
00:12:14,296 --> 0:12:16,066
AR Experiences with Reality

384
00:12:16,066 --> 0:12:17,746
Composer, my friend Powell

385
00:12:17,746 --> 0:12:19,096
created a quick lesson

386
00:12:19,356 --> 0:12:20,746
illustrating different seasons

387
00:12:20,746 --> 0:12:23,026
on Earth, and he sent me a copy.

388
00:12:24,256 --> 0:12:26,236
So let's go ahead and view that

389
00:12:26,236 --> 0:12:26,916
in AR Quick Look.

390
00:12:40,926 --> 0:12:42,396
Now, as you may recall, this

391
00:12:42,396 --> 0:12:44,216
entire experience is driven

392
00:12:44,306 --> 0:12:45,626
through scene start triggers.

393
00:12:46,616 --> 0:12:48,716
For example, the moon, it

394
00:12:48,716 --> 0:12:50,006
triggers the moon to rotate

395
00:12:50,006 --> 0:12:51,736
around the Earth and the Earth

396
00:12:52,136 --> 0:12:53,686
to rotate around the sun.

397
00:12:54,276 --> 0:12:56,896
As the Earth circles the sun,

398
00:12:57,466 --> 0:12:59,686
the appropriate season appears.

399
00:13:00,176 --> 0:13:04,326
And this is created using weight

400
00:13:04,326 --> 0:13:06,556
action followed by a show

401
00:13:06,556 --> 0:13:06,846
action.

402
00:13:08,426 --> 0:13:09,886
And after a slight delay, the

403
00:13:09,886 --> 0:13:12,096
sign disappears using a hide

404
00:13:12,096 --> 0:13:12,456
action.

405
00:13:16,286 --> 0:13:17,546
Now, you may have noticed that

406
00:13:17,546 --> 0:13:19,776
no matter where I look, the sign

407
00:13:19,856 --> 0:13:21,666
is always oriented towards me,

408
00:13:22,226 --> 0:13:26,706
and this is achieved by using a

409
00:13:26,706 --> 0:13:27,466
look at action.

410
00:13:34,056 --> 0:13:35,506
So, that's a quick overview of

411
00:13:35,506 --> 0:13:36,766
how easy it is to preview

412
00:13:36,766 --> 0:13:38,456
Reality Files, such as this

413
00:13:38,456 --> 0:13:40,506
short lesson inside AR Quick

414
00:13:40,976 --> 0:13:41,086
Look.

415
00:13:42,816 --> 0:13:44,426
And now, I have another demo,

416
00:13:44,666 --> 0:13:46,136
and for this, we're going to

417
00:13:46,136 --> 0:13:47,426
take a road trip around the

418
00:13:47,426 --> 0:13:47,996
solar system.

419
00:13:53,016 --> 0:13:54,826
So, in the same session, my

420
00:13:54,826 --> 0:13:57,196
friend Avi created a project

421
00:13:57,246 --> 0:13:59,046
showing three celestial bodies,

422
00:13:59,686 --> 0:14:01,456
the moon, the Earth, and the

423
00:13:59,686 --> 0:14:01,456
the moon, the Earth, and the

424
00:14:01,456 --> 0:14:01,786
sun.

425
00:14:02,616 --> 0:14:04,826
I've expanded upon that to add

426
00:14:04,826 --> 0:14:06,696
some more features to show you

427
00:14:06,766 --> 0:14:08,656
different behaviors in action.

428
00:14:09,256 --> 0:14:09,966
So let's take a look.

429
00:14:20,076 --> 0:14:21,176
So the most obvious starting

430
00:14:21,256 --> 0:14:22,936
point of our journey is of

431
00:14:22,936 --> 0:14:23,876
course the Earth.

432
00:14:23,876 --> 0:14:26,856
But unfortunately we cannot get

433
00:14:26,856 --> 0:14:28,316
to space inside a car.

434
00:14:28,776 --> 0:14:29,886
We need something with a more

435
00:14:29,886 --> 0:14:30,806
powerful engine.

436
00:14:31,326 --> 0:14:32,396
I think I have an idea.

437
00:14:33,586 --> 0:14:35,276
Notice that I can see what

438
00:14:35,276 --> 0:14:37,456
triggers I can interact with by

439
00:14:37,456 --> 0:14:38,666
looking at the above text.

440
00:14:38,986 --> 0:14:41,196
For example, here I can see move

441
00:14:41,196 --> 0:14:43,676
closer to activate.

442
00:14:43,676 --> 0:14:45,136
So there must be a proximity

443
00:14:45,136 --> 0:14:45,476
trigger.

444
00:14:46,146 --> 0:14:48,426
Let's go ahead and take a closer

445
00:14:49,016 --> 0:14:49,106
look.

446
00:14:50,936 --> 0:14:51,966
Oh, hey, it's a rocket.

447
00:14:52,486 --> 0:14:53,956
Perfect for going to space.

448
00:14:54,586 --> 0:14:57,296
Notice that I, there's a tap

449
00:14:57,296 --> 0:14:58,966
trigger here, so I'm going to go

450
00:14:58,966 --> 0:15:00,406
ahead and launch the rocket.

451
00:14:58,966 --> 0:15:00,406
ahead and launch the rocket.

452
00:15:01,396 --> 0:15:04,066
And we have lift off.

453
00:15:05,186 --> 0:15:08,226
So now let's set a course for

454
00:15:08,226 --> 0:15:08,726
the moon.

455
00:15:10,406 --> 0:15:11,846
And let's try to stick to that

456
00:15:11,846 --> 0:15:12,506
landing.

457
00:15:15,586 --> 0:15:16,116
Nailed it.

458
00:15:16,996 --> 0:15:18,556
Oh, look, there's a sign here.

459
00:15:19,556 --> 0:15:20,606
Well, good thing we took the

460
00:15:20,606 --> 0:15:21,776
rocket, not the car.

461
00:15:26,796 --> 0:15:29,086
So the thing about space is that

462
00:15:29,086 --> 0:15:31,816
it is hard to view the sizes of

463
00:15:31,816 --> 0:15:33,716
celestial bodies because the

464
00:15:33,716 --> 0:15:35,936
sizes are so hard it's hard to

465
00:15:36,476 --> 0:15:36,836
grasp.

466
00:15:36,836 --> 0:15:38,416
However, we can easily

467
00:15:38,416 --> 0:15:40,546
illustrate this with the help

468
00:15:40,716 --> 0:15:40,986
AR.

469
00:15:41,936 --> 0:15:44,306
So, I'm going to tap here and

470
00:15:44,366 --> 0:15:45,716
fly up and out of here.

471
00:15:47,046 --> 0:15:49,666
And this time, let's go up

472
00:15:49,666 --> 0:15:51,606
higher so that we can take an

473
00:15:51,606 --> 0:15:54,156
overview look of the moon, the

474
00:15:54,156 --> 0:15:55,506
Earth, and the sun.

475
00:15:56,006 --> 0:16:02,086
And I'll tap on the sun to get a

476
00:15:56,006 --> 0:16:02,086
And I'll tap on the sun to get a

477
00:16:02,086 --> 0:16:04,406
better sense.

478
00:16:04,556 --> 0:16:07,636
Whoa. And as you can see, the

479
00:16:07,636 --> 0:16:09,306
sun is absolutely enormous

480
00:16:09,456 --> 0:16:10,606
compared to the size of the

481
00:16:10,606 --> 0:16:10,836
Earth.

482
00:16:11,956 --> 0:16:13,446
Too bad the distances are not to

483
00:16:13,446 --> 0:16:15,076
scale, otherwise it might

484
00:16:15,126 --> 0:16:16,346
actually be quite warm in this

485
00:16:16,346 --> 0:16:16,596
room.

486
00:16:21,476 --> 0:16:23,496
So that's a quick look at how

487
00:16:23,496 --> 0:16:25,346
easy it is to view authored

488
00:16:25,346 --> 0:16:29,206
content inside Reality, to view

489
00:16:29,206 --> 0:16:30,906
rich content authored using

490
00:16:30,906 --> 0:16:32,786
Reality Composer and viewed

491
00:16:32,786 --> 0:16:33,756
inside AR Quick Look.

492
00:16:34,286 --> 0:16:37,356
And we absolutely cannot wait to

493
00:16:37,356 --> 0:16:39,206
see what kinds of content that

494
00:16:39,206 --> 0:16:45,036
you can create.

495
00:16:45,606 --> 0:16:46,776
So, now, let's talk about the

496
00:16:46,776 --> 0:16:48,706
visual improvements of AR Quick

497
00:16:48,706 --> 0:16:49,106
Look.

498
00:16:50,936 --> 0:16:52,026
One of the main goals of AR

499
00:16:52,026 --> 0:16:53,586
Quick Look is to create a

500
00:16:53,586 --> 0:16:56,056
believable AR experience, and to

501
00:16:56,056 --> 0:16:58,736
achieve that, it is important to

502
00:16:58,736 --> 0:17:00,636
understand and take into account

503
00:16:58,736 --> 0:17:00,636
understand and take into account

504
00:17:00,976 --> 0:17:02,316
the surrounding environment of

505
00:17:02,316 --> 0:17:02,856
the user.

506
00:17:04,116 --> 0:17:06,266
This year, we added a variety of

507
00:17:06,266 --> 0:17:08,215
new rendering effects to make

508
00:17:08,215 --> 0:17:10,116
the content look as if it is

509
00:17:10,116 --> 0:17:11,306
truly part of the world.

510
00:17:12,576 --> 0:17:14,736
let's go into some more details,

511
00:17:14,935 --> 0:17:16,705
starting off with real-time

512
00:17:16,705 --> 0:17:17,286
shadows.

513
00:17:17,836 --> 0:17:20,566
Last year, AR Quick Look

514
00:17:20,616 --> 0:17:22,195
rendered shadows to make virtual

515
00:17:22,195 --> 0:17:24,536
content look as if was part of

516
00:17:24,536 --> 0:17:24,925
the world.

517
00:17:26,376 --> 0:17:27,656
This year, we made shadows

518
00:17:27,656 --> 0:17:29,566
dynamic and rendered in real

519
00:17:29,636 --> 0:17:29,896
time.

520
00:17:30,216 --> 0:17:32,276
So now shadows can follow your

521
00:17:32,276 --> 0:17:34,436
content as if it was part of the

522
00:17:34,436 --> 0:17:36,496
world, and this helps bring your

523
00:17:36,496 --> 0:17:37,966
animated content to life.

524
00:17:39,796 --> 0:17:42,016
By default, projective shadows

525
00:17:42,056 --> 0:17:43,996
are used as it provides a good

526
00:17:43,996 --> 0:17:45,706
approximation for how shadows

527
00:17:45,706 --> 0:17:47,116
look like in the real world.

528
00:17:47,716 --> 0:17:51,576
And on higher-end devices, like

529
00:17:51,576 --> 0:17:53,726
iPhone 10S, AR Quick Look will

530
00:17:53,726 --> 0:17:55,396
use a ray-traced technique,

531
00:17:56,046 --> 0:17:57,506
which produces physically

532
00:17:57,506 --> 0:17:59,926
correct shadows and looks even

533
00:17:59,926 --> 0:18:00,286
better.

534
00:17:59,926 --> 0:18:00,286
better.

535
00:18:05,356 --> 0:18:06,966
One key difference between

536
00:18:06,966 --> 0:18:08,366
ray-traced shadows and

537
00:18:08,366 --> 0:18:10,256
projective is that ray-traced

538
00:18:10,256 --> 0:18:11,946
technique produces softer

539
00:18:11,946 --> 0:18:14,076
shadows and is especially great

540
00:18:14,336 --> 0:18:16,136
for objects with fine contact

541
00:18:16,936 --> 0:18:17,096
points.

542
00:18:18,166 --> 0:18:19,766
Now, we've made great strides in

543
00:18:19,766 --> 0:18:21,996
terms of optimizations to enable

544
00:18:22,046 --> 0:18:23,476
AR Quick Look to perform

545
00:18:23,656 --> 0:18:25,956
real-time ray-tracing of dynamic

546
00:18:26,026 --> 0:18:28,776
scenes, all on a mobile device.

547
00:18:30,146 --> 0:18:31,196
If you're interested in learning

548
00:18:31,196 --> 0:18:33,196
more about ray-traced shadows, I

549
00:18:33,196 --> 0:18:34,636
recommend checking out the

550
00:18:34,636 --> 0:18:36,596
Ray-tracing with Metal session

551
00:18:36,926 --> 0:18:38,236
later today at 11.

552
00:18:38,916 --> 0:18:41,726
And since dynamic shadows are

553
00:18:41,726 --> 0:18:44,346
rendered in real time on all

554
00:18:44,346 --> 0:18:46,306
ARKit supported devices, you do

555
00:18:46,306 --> 0:18:47,946
not need to bake in shadows as

556
00:18:47,996 --> 0:18:48,826
part of your model.

557
00:18:52,576 --> 0:18:54,516
Another new visual effect is

558
00:18:54,516 --> 0:18:55,296
cameral noise.

559
00:18:55,976 --> 0:18:57,856
In low light situations, you

560
00:18:57,856 --> 0:19:00,286
might notice noise in your video

561
00:18:57,856 --> 0:19:00,286
might notice noise in your video

562
00:19:00,496 --> 0:19:01,746
because there just isn't enough

563
00:19:01,746 --> 0:19:03,886
light captured by the camera

564
00:19:03,886 --> 0:19:04,276
sensor.

565
00:19:04,796 --> 0:19:07,116
Since virtual objects are

566
00:19:07,116 --> 0:19:08,586
rendered on top of the camera

567
00:19:08,586 --> 0:19:10,276
feed, they will remain free of

568
00:19:10,276 --> 0:19:13,176
artifacts, making your content

569
00:19:13,316 --> 0:19:14,326
look out of place.

570
00:19:15,426 --> 0:19:17,086
Well, now, Reality Kit supports

571
00:19:17,226 --> 0:19:19,006
camera grain, so the noise will

572
00:19:19,006 --> 0:19:20,786
be added to the virtual content

573
00:19:21,206 --> 0:19:22,506
based on the amount of noise in

574
00:19:22,506 --> 0:19:24,396
the camera feed to create an

575
00:19:24,396 --> 0:19:25,856
effect that the robot is

576
00:19:25,856 --> 0:19:27,866
actually part of the scene.

577
00:19:30,396 --> 0:19:32,216
This is done by taking the noise

578
00:19:32,216 --> 0:19:34,536
texture provided by ARKit and

579
00:19:34,616 --> 0:19:36,236
applying that to the virtual

580
00:19:37,006 --> 0:19:37,246
content.

581
00:19:39,576 --> 0:19:41,526
Camera grain is automatically

582
00:19:41,526 --> 0:19:43,486
enabled on all ARKit supported

583
00:19:43,516 --> 0:19:44,146
devices.

584
00:19:47,556 --> 0:19:49,096
Depending on your model and the

585
00:19:49,096 --> 0:19:50,896
environment, some colors may

586
00:19:50,896 --> 0:19:52,346
look too bright or blown out,

587
00:19:52,566 --> 0:19:53,986
such as the shiny marble.

588
00:19:54,636 --> 0:19:57,846
AR Quick Look uses HDR with tone

589
00:19:57,846 --> 0:19:59,296
mapping to provide a greater

590
00:19:59,296 --> 0:20:00,776
range of brightness and

591
00:19:59,296 --> 0:20:00,776
range of brightness and

592
00:20:00,776 --> 0:20:01,536
contrast.

593
00:20:02,016 --> 0:20:05,626
As you can see, without it, the

594
00:20:05,626 --> 0:20:07,446
marble looks too bright and out

595
00:20:07,446 --> 0:20:08,016
of place.

596
00:20:08,736 --> 0:20:11,876
But with HDR, it blends in with

597
00:20:11,876 --> 0:20:12,526
the environment.

598
00:20:13,256 --> 0:20:15,866
Under the hood, Reality Kit

599
00:20:15,976 --> 0:20:17,746
allocates 16 bits per color

600
00:20:17,746 --> 0:20:19,986
channel, and this allows for a

601
00:20:19,986 --> 0:20:21,936
greater range of color values to

602
00:20:21,936 --> 0:20:23,516
be represented and passed

603
00:20:23,556 --> 0:20:24,336
through the shaders.

604
00:20:24,846 --> 0:20:27,836
This then gets mapped using a

605
00:20:27,836 --> 0:20:30,326
custom tone mapping curve and

606
00:20:30,496 --> 0:20:31,986
rendered to the final texture.

607
00:20:32,646 --> 0:20:35,696
HDR with tone mapping is

608
00:20:35,696 --> 0:20:38,286
available on all A10X devices

609
00:20:38,446 --> 0:20:39,616
and later.

610
00:20:41,956 --> 0:20:42,986
Now, if you're like me who has

611
00:20:42,986 --> 0:20:44,406
tried to grab a virtual object

612
00:20:44,686 --> 0:20:46,156
or had people walk in front of

613
00:20:46,156 --> 0:20:47,836
them, then you probably noticed

614
00:20:47,836 --> 0:20:49,266
that virtual objects are always

615
00:20:49,436 --> 0:20:51,186
rendered in front of people when

616
00:20:51,186 --> 0:20:53,436
it should be behind, breaking

617
00:20:53,436 --> 0:20:53,936
the illusion.

618
00:20:54,536 --> 0:20:58,366
Now, with people occlusion, you

619
00:20:58,366 --> 0:20:59,456
can create the illusion that

620
00:20:59,456 --> 0:21:00,666
someone is actually walking

621
00:20:59,456 --> 0:21:00,666
someone is actually walking

622
00:21:00,726 --> 0:21:02,356
through a collection of virtual

623
00:21:02,356 --> 0:21:04,876
tin toys as if it was right

624
00:21:04,876 --> 0:21:06,046
there in your world.

625
00:21:10,736 --> 0:21:11,966
This uses the person

626
00:21:11,966 --> 0:21:13,656
segmentation data provided by

627
00:21:13,656 --> 0:21:15,406
ARKit to know what part of the

628
00:21:15,406 --> 0:21:17,956
camera feed should remain drawn

629
00:21:18,176 --> 0:21:20,266
on top of the virtual content.

630
00:21:21,696 --> 0:21:23,726
People occlusion takes advantage

631
00:21:23,756 --> 0:21:25,346
of the Apple neural engine and

632
00:21:25,346 --> 0:21:27,626
will be available on all A12

633
00:21:27,736 --> 0:21:28,856
devices and later.

634
00:21:29,546 --> 0:21:32,216
Now, this is a really hard

635
00:21:32,216 --> 0:21:33,696
problem to solve, but if you're

636
00:21:33,696 --> 0:21:35,046
curious to learn more, I

637
00:21:35,046 --> 0:21:36,076
recommended checking out the

638
00:21:36,076 --> 0:21:37,816
Introducing ARKit 3 session.

639
00:21:41,776 --> 0:21:43,406
Digital cameras can only focus

640
00:21:43,406 --> 0:21:45,056
on a certain distance at any

641
00:21:45,056 --> 0:21:45,726
given time.

642
00:21:46,456 --> 0:21:48,276
Objects closer or further from

643
00:21:48,276 --> 0:21:50,346
this distance will look out of

644
00:21:50,346 --> 0:21:50,936
focus.

645
00:21:51,406 --> 0:21:55,186
Without this effect all virtual

646
00:21:55,186 --> 0:21:56,906
objects will look in focus,

647
00:21:57,526 --> 0:21:59,026
which stands out from the camera

648
00:21:59,086 --> 0:21:59,306
feed.

649
00:22:00,626 --> 0:22:02,036
Reality Kit takes the object's

650
00:22:02,096 --> 0:22:04,986
distance into account tor ender

651
00:22:04,986 --> 0:22:06,936
it as if it was captured from

652
00:22:06,936 --> 0:22:07,386
your camera.

653
00:22:08,286 --> 0:22:09,316
And this allows the virtual

654
00:22:09,316 --> 0:22:11,396
object to blend in with the rest

655
00:22:11,496 --> 0:22:13,236
of the camera feed to make it

656
00:22:13,896 --> 0:22:15,666
seem as if it was really there.

657
00:22:16,156 --> 0:22:19,206
This is available on all A12X

658
00:22:21,216 --> 0:22:21,596
devices.

659
00:22:21,976 --> 0:22:23,466
Motion blur is the phenomenon

660
00:22:23,466 --> 0:22:25,146
caused by real-world objects

661
00:22:25,216 --> 0:22:26,616
moving faster than what the

662
00:22:26,616 --> 0:22:28,836
camera can capture, creating a

663
00:22:28,836 --> 0:22:30,006
steak-like effects.

664
00:22:30,536 --> 0:22:33,606
As you can see in the freeze

665
00:22:33,606 --> 0:22:35,246
frame here, the robot on the

666
00:22:35,246 --> 0:22:37,366
left does not fit with the scene

667
00:22:37,506 --> 0:22:38,946
when motion blur is turned off.

668
00:22:39,466 --> 0:22:43,396
Reality Kit applies motion blur

669
00:22:43,466 --> 0:22:44,916
to the virtual content by

670
00:22:44,916 --> 0:22:46,656
interpolating between textures

671
00:22:46,836 --> 0:22:49,486
of two consecutive frames, which

672
00:22:49,486 --> 0:22:51,906
depends on the device motion and

673
00:22:51,906 --> 0:22:53,746
the length of exposure to better

674
00:22:53,746 --> 0:22:54,996
match the camera feed.

675
00:22:55,586 --> 0:22:58,816
You'll be able to experience

676
00:22:58,816 --> 0:23:01,786
this effect in AR Quick Look on

677
00:22:58,816 --> 0:23:01,786
this effect in AR Quick Look on

678
00:23:01,976 --> 0:23:03,226
A12X devices.

679
00:23:05,576 --> 0:23:07,936
We strive to bring more realism

680
00:23:07,936 --> 0:23:09,296
to the virtual content with

681
00:23:09,296 --> 0:23:10,856
these new rendering effects, but

682
00:23:10,856 --> 0:23:12,186
we also have to keep in mind

683
00:23:12,436 --> 0:23:15,056
that these are expensive

684
00:23:15,056 --> 0:23:16,936
operations that must be done in

685
00:23:16,936 --> 0:23:17,466
real-time.

686
00:23:18,376 --> 0:23:20,026
We optimize and finetune the

687
00:23:20,026 --> 0:23:21,326
rendering effects to create the

688
00:23:21,326 --> 0:23:23,856
best experience at both

689
00:23:24,186 --> 0:23:26,576
realistic and performant on all

690
00:23:26,636 --> 0:23:28,046
iOS 13 devices.

691
00:23:28,606 --> 0:23:31,336
That's why AR Quick Look would

692
00:23:31,336 --> 0:23:32,776
automatically apply the best

693
00:23:32,876 --> 0:23:34,526
rendering effect for your device

694
00:23:34,726 --> 0:23:35,976
so that you can focus on

695
00:23:35,976 --> 0:23:38,186
creating rich content and

696
00:23:38,186 --> 0:23:38,936
experiences.

697
00:23:43,626 --> 0:23:45,526
Now, in addition to making

698
00:23:45,526 --> 0:23:46,766
content feel like it is part of

699
00:23:46,766 --> 0:23:47,916
the world, we've also made

700
00:23:47,916 --> 0:23:49,526
enhancements to the entire view

701
00:23:49,526 --> 0:23:50,106
experience.

702
00:23:51,126 --> 0:23:52,436
First off, AR Quick Look now

703
00:23:52,436 --> 0:23:54,636
launches straight into AR so

704
00:23:54,636 --> 0:23:56,126
that you can immediately see and

705
00:23:56,126 --> 0:23:57,926
interact with virtual content in

706
00:23:57,926 --> 0:23:58,396
your world.

707
00:23:59,336 --> 0:24:00,876
For example, you can quickly put

708
00:23:59,336 --> 0:24:00,876
For example, you can quickly put

709
00:24:01,006 --> 0:24:02,816
virtual objects on detective

710
00:24:02,876 --> 0:24:05,616
planes or try on sunglasses and

711
00:24:06,586 --> 0:24:08,476
take selfies.

712
00:24:08,596 --> 0:24:10,026
We've also made improvement to

713
00:24:10,086 --> 0:24:11,756
scene understanding for better

714
00:24:11,806 --> 0:24:13,566
and faster plane detection to

715
00:24:13,616 --> 0:24:15,346
push the object directly into

716
00:24:15,346 --> 0:24:17,706
the world as quickly as

717
00:24:18,816 --> 0:24:19,046
possible.

718
00:24:19,126 --> 0:24:20,226
We used machine learning to

719
00:24:20,226 --> 0:24:22,296
better detect walls as well as

720
00:24:22,296 --> 0:24:23,976
to extend the breadth of already

721
00:24:23,976 --> 0:24:24,846
detected planes.

722
00:24:25,376 --> 0:24:29,076
And just like last year, AR

723
00:24:29,076 --> 0:24:30,976
Quick Look securely runs in a

724
00:24:30,976 --> 0:24:32,826
sandbox process, separate from

725
00:24:32,826 --> 0:24:33,326
the host.

726
00:24:34,356 --> 0:24:35,776
By launching straight into AR,

727
00:24:36,106 --> 0:24:38,416
websites and apps do not have

728
00:24:38,416 --> 0:24:40,316
access to the camera feed or any

729
00:24:40,316 --> 0:24:41,146
user activity.

730
00:24:43,176 --> 0:24:45,626
And here's a quick video showing

731
00:24:45,626 --> 0:24:48,526
how fast this can be.

732
00:24:48,776 --> 0:24:49,886
Going to tap on the thumbnail

733
00:24:50,206 --> 0:24:52,026
and place a Newton's cradle directly

734
00:24:52,026 --> 0:24:55,526
on the table.

735
00:24:56,136 --> 0:24:57,256
We've also added support for

736
00:24:57,256 --> 0:24:59,016
viewing multiple models through

737
00:24:59,016 --> 0:25:00,426
a nested USDZ file.

738
00:24:59,016 --> 0:25:00,426
a nested USDZ file.

739
00:25:01,026 --> 0:25:03,826
This is a special USDZ which

740
00:25:03,826 --> 0:25:06,056
contains metadata and a library

741
00:25:06,126 --> 0:25:07,226
of USDZs.

742
00:25:08,336 --> 0:25:09,666
This can be useful to create

743
00:25:09,666 --> 0:25:11,376
collections of related objects,

744
00:25:11,486 --> 0:25:13,526
such as a furniture set, a

745
00:25:13,526 --> 0:25:15,756
shopping cart, or in this case,

746
00:25:15,946 --> 0:25:16,676
sports equipment.

747
00:25:17,336 --> 0:25:21,036
In AR Quick Look, all containing

748
00:25:21,036 --> 0:25:23,476
USDZ files are loaded and lined

749
00:25:23,476 --> 0:25:24,806
up in ascending height order,

750
00:25:25,416 --> 0:25:27,056
which offers a clear method of

751
00:25:27,056 --> 0:25:29,066
displaying a variety of

752
00:25:29,116 --> 0:25:29,986
different models.

753
00:25:31,356 --> 0:25:32,176
And these can then be

754
00:25:32,176 --> 0:25:33,956
manipulated independently once

755
00:25:34,016 --> 0:25:35,736
placed into the world and

756
00:25:35,736 --> 0:25:37,766
arranged to your liking.

757
00:25:40,456 --> 0:25:42,446
There's a saying that a picture

758
00:25:42,486 --> 0:25:44,526
is worth a thousand words, and a

759
00:25:44,526 --> 0:25:46,296
video is perhaps millions.

760
00:25:46,856 --> 0:25:48,576
But what about animated AR

761
00:25:48,576 --> 0:25:49,086
content?

762
00:25:50,916 --> 0:25:52,346
Animations bring a whole new

763
00:25:52,346 --> 0:25:53,956
level to the experience, and now

764
00:25:53,956 --> 0:25:55,676
users can control the playback

765
00:25:55,956 --> 0:25:57,506
of animations such as

766
00:25:57,566 --> 0:26:01,126
play/pause, rewind, skip, and

767
00:25:57,566 --> 0:26:01,126
play/pause, rewind, skip, and

768
00:26:01,476 --> 0:26:02,306
fine scrubbing.

769
00:26:02,876 --> 0:26:05,586
And the great thing about

770
00:26:05,586 --> 0:26:07,486
viewing AR animated content is

771
00:26:07,486 --> 0:26:09,126
that users can rewatch it from

772
00:26:09,126 --> 0:26:10,626
different angles, allowing

773
00:26:10,626 --> 0:26:12,296
themselves to be the director.

774
00:26:16,156 --> 0:26:18,206
For USDZ models, the animation

775
00:26:18,206 --> 0:26:19,826
scrubber will be shown if the

776
00:26:19,826 --> 0:26:21,506
animation duration is at least

777
00:26:21,686 --> 0:26:22,376
10 seconds.

778
00:26:24,456 --> 0:26:26,646
And for content less than that,

779
00:26:27,116 --> 0:26:28,496
the animation scrubber will be

780
00:26:28,616 --> 0:26:30,736
hidden, and the entire animation

781
00:26:30,796 --> 0:26:33,046
sequence will continue to loop.

782
00:26:34,826 --> 0:26:37,516
For reality files, the animation

783
00:26:37,516 --> 0:26:38,626
scrubber will be shown if

784
00:26:38,626 --> 0:26:40,386
there's a single on start

785
00:26:40,386 --> 0:26:42,506
trigger with at least one

786
00:26:42,506 --> 0:26:43,446
animation action.

787
00:26:44,276 --> 0:26:46,256
And optionally, you can attach

788
00:26:46,256 --> 0:26:47,976
sound action so that it plays

789
00:26:47,976 --> 0:26:49,176
along with your animated

790
00:26:49,176 --> 0:26:49,626
content.

791
00:26:50,266 --> 0:26:53,516
And here's how that would look

792
00:26:53,516 --> 0:26:55,136
like in Reality Composer.

793
00:26:56,576 --> 0:26:58,446
Tapping on the behaviors panel

794
00:26:58,886 --> 0:26:59,696
shows this.

795
00:27:00,216 --> 0:27:01,886
So, here I have a single same

796
00:27:01,886 --> 0:27:04,896
start trigger followed by one

797
00:27:04,896 --> 0:27:07,036
USDZ animation as well as a

798
00:27:07,036 --> 0:27:11,026
sound to go along with it.

799
00:27:11,776 --> 0:27:13,136
Now, we have a really cool

800
00:27:13,136 --> 0:27:13,556
gesture.

801
00:27:13,776 --> 0:27:15,006
It's called levitation.

802
00:27:16,246 --> 0:27:18,206
Simply swipe up with two fingers

803
00:27:18,716 --> 0:27:19,926
to levitate objects up.

804
00:27:20,836 --> 0:27:22,586
For example, you can levitate

805
00:27:22,806 --> 0:27:24,686
these balloons to decorate your

806
00:27:24,686 --> 0:27:25,006
party.

807
00:27:25,676 --> 0:27:29,216
AR Quick Look provides a portal

808
00:27:29,336 --> 0:27:30,846
for users to enjoy immersive

809
00:27:30,846 --> 0:27:32,546
experiences, but wouldn't it be

810
00:27:32,546 --> 0:27:34,286
cool to share what you see on

811
00:27:34,286 --> 0:27:36,126
the screen with other people?

812
00:27:37,336 --> 0:27:38,996
Now, you can record exactly what

813
00:27:38,996 --> 0:27:41,206
you see such as organizing that

814
00:27:41,206 --> 0:27:43,916
birthday party simply by tapping

815
00:27:44,036 --> 0:27:45,596
and holding on the shutter

816
00:27:45,596 --> 0:27:47,716
button and release when you're

817
00:27:47,716 --> 0:27:47,936
done.

818
00:27:48,526 --> 0:27:50,216
Videos are automatically saved

819
00:27:50,536 --> 0:27:51,426
to the photos library.

820
00:27:53,816 --> 0:27:55,456
We made improvements to macOS

821
00:27:55,456 --> 0:27:56,996
Quick Look Viewer as well.

822
00:27:57,676 --> 0:27:59,066
In addition to being able to

823
00:27:59,066 --> 0:28:01,386
preview USDZ files, it also

824
00:27:59,066 --> 0:28:01,386
preview USDZ files, it also

825
00:28:01,386 --> 0:28:04,236
supports reality files, and

826
00:28:04,236 --> 0:28:05,526
thumbnails will be generated

827
00:28:06,036 --> 0:28:07,916
right away so that you can find

828
00:28:08,106 --> 0:28:09,006
the files faster.

829
00:28:10,146 --> 0:28:12,116
It is built on top of Reality

830
00:28:12,116 --> 0:28:13,786
Kit, which uses the same

831
00:28:13,786 --> 0:28:15,806
physics-based rendering as iOS,

832
00:28:16,516 --> 0:28:18,376
and this provides a consistent

833
00:28:18,376 --> 0:28:20,736
previewing experience on all

834
00:28:20,786 --> 0:28:21,566
your devices.

835
00:28:24,216 --> 0:28:25,296
We think this will make it

836
00:28:25,296 --> 0:28:27,156
easier to preview author content

837
00:28:27,526 --> 0:28:29,206
and take advantage of all the

838
00:28:29,206 --> 0:28:31,606
power and tools available on a

839
00:28:32,426 --> 0:28:32,526
Mac.

840
00:28:33,256 --> 0:28:34,566
That's a quick run through of

841
00:28:34,566 --> 0:28:36,156
all the visual improvements and

842
00:28:36,156 --> 0:28:37,416
previewing experience in AR

843
00:28:37,416 --> 0:28:38,166
Quick Look.

844
00:28:38,236 --> 0:28:39,306
And now I'll hand it back to

845
00:28:39,306 --> 0:28:41,026
David, who will talk more about

846
00:28:41,026 --> 0:28:43,676
the integrations on the web.

847
00:28:44,516 --> 0:28:47,566
[ Applause ]

848
00:28:48,066 --> 0:28:48,356
&gt;&gt; Thanks.

849
00:28:49,286 --> 0:28:50,116
Thanks Jerry.

850
00:28:50,606 --> 0:28:52,076
So we all just saw the new

851
00:28:52,156 --> 0:28:53,896
features and improvements added

852
00:28:53,896 --> 0:28:54,986
to AR Quick Look this year.

853
00:28:55,806 --> 0:28:57,106
So, now, let's talk about how to

854
00:28:57,106 --> 0:28:58,976
view those experiences on the

855
00:28:59,626 --> 0:28:59,726
web.

856
00:29:00,276 --> 0:29:02,896
With iOS 12, you can view USDZ

857
00:29:02,896 --> 0:29:04,516
files on the web through AR

858
00:29:04,516 --> 0:29:04,996
Quick Look.

859
00:29:05,626 --> 0:29:06,916
For your website to support

860
00:29:06,916 --> 0:29:09,826
this, simply add HTML markup and

861
00:29:09,826 --> 0:29:11,066
specify the MIME type.

862
00:29:12,276 --> 0:29:13,756
This automatically adds the AR

863
00:29:13,756 --> 0:29:15,056
badge in the top right-hand

864
00:29:15,056 --> 0:29:16,696
corner of your thumbnail image

865
00:29:16,696 --> 0:29:17,756
to let users know that they can

866
00:29:17,756 --> 0:29:19,366
view this content in AR.

867
00:29:20,156 --> 0:29:21,816
Tapping on the thumbnail will

868
00:29:21,816 --> 0:29:22,766
launch AR Quick Look.

869
00:29:24,526 --> 0:29:25,786
This easily transforms your

870
00:29:25,786 --> 0:29:28,006
website into a seamless AR

871
00:29:28,006 --> 0:29:29,776
viewing experience as there's no

872
00:29:29,776 --> 0:29:31,146
need to download any

873
00:29:31,146 --> 0:29:31,696
application.

874
00:29:32,306 --> 0:29:35,446
Adding support consists of two

875
00:29:35,446 --> 0:29:35,746
things.

876
00:29:36,486 --> 0:29:38,606
The HTML markup and the MIME

877
00:29:38,606 --> 0:29:38,836
type.

878
00:29:39,606 --> 0:29:40,936
The first step is to add the

879
00:29:40,936 --> 0:29:42,566
HTML markup, which involves

880
00:29:42,706 --> 0:29:45,846
adding the rel equals AR

881
00:29:45,846 --> 0:29:47,666
attribute to your A link

882
00:29:47,666 --> 0:29:50,206
element, allowing Safari to

883
00:29:50,206 --> 0:29:51,546
recognize and launch AR Quick

884
00:29:51,546 --> 0:29:53,076
Look from the same webpage.

885
00:29:54,826 --> 0:29:56,236
The link must contain a single

886
00:29:56,236 --> 0:29:58,666
child that is either an image or

887
00:29:58,666 --> 0:30:00,906
a picture element, and the image

888
00:29:58,666 --> 0:30:00,906
a picture element, and the image

889
00:30:00,906 --> 0:30:02,116
that you provide inside the

890
00:30:02,116 --> 0:30:03,636
anchor will be used as a

891
00:30:03,636 --> 0:30:06,416
thumbnail image for your virtual

892
00:30:06,966 --> 0:30:07,186
content.

893
00:30:09,426 --> 0:30:10,676
The second step that's needed in

894
00:30:10,676 --> 0:30:12,696
order for Safari to recognize AR

895
00:30:12,696 --> 0:30:14,136
content is to add the

896
00:30:14,206 --> 0:30:15,676
appropriate MIME type when

897
00:30:15,676 --> 0:30:16,806
serving that content.

898
00:30:17,596 --> 0:30:19,396
To add support for previewing

899
00:30:19,396 --> 0:30:21,636
USDZ files on the web, simply

900
00:30:21,636 --> 0:30:23,256
add this MIME type for USDZ

901
00:30:23,256 --> 0:30:23,646
files.

902
00:30:24,776 --> 0:30:26,306
This provides the metadata for

903
00:30:26,306 --> 0:30:28,646
Safari to open both regular and

904
00:30:28,646 --> 0:30:30,756
nested USDZs directly in AR

905
00:30:30,756 --> 0:30:31,236
Quick Look.

906
00:30:32,406 --> 0:30:33,746
And likewise, you would need to

907
00:30:33,746 --> 0:30:35,256
configure your web server to

908
00:30:35,256 --> 0:30:36,666
serve the appropriate headers

909
00:30:36,666 --> 0:30:37,736
for reality files.

910
00:30:38,266 --> 0:30:39,996
And adding this MIME type will

911
00:30:39,996 --> 0:30:41,586
open reality files within AR

912
00:30:41,586 --> 0:30:43,206
Quick Look from the web.

913
00:30:44,536 --> 0:30:46,306
In addition to downloading

914
00:30:46,306 --> 0:30:47,696
content from a server, you can

915
00:30:47,696 --> 0:30:49,286
also open up AR Quick Look by

916
00:30:49,286 --> 0:30:50,496
passing in local data.

917
00:30:51,376 --> 0:30:53,066
One supported format is the data

918
00:30:53,066 --> 0:30:55,126
URIs, which allows developers to

919
00:30:55,126 --> 0:30:56,936
load content from a base 64

920
00:30:56,936 --> 0:30:58,246
encoded data string.

921
00:30:59,126 --> 0:31:00,436
So, for example, here's how to

922
00:30:59,126 --> 0:31:00,436
So, for example, here's how to

923
00:31:00,436 --> 0:31:05,506
load a USDZ file through a data

924
00:31:05,576 --> 0:31:05,643
URL.

925
00:31:05,926 --> 0:31:07,676
Notice that you specify the same

926
00:31:07,676 --> 0:31:09,156
MIME type at the beginning of

927
00:31:09,156 --> 0:31:11,706
the data string, and to load a

928
00:31:11,706 --> 0:31:13,876
reality file, simply switch the

929
00:31:13,876 --> 0:31:15,006
MIME type.

930
00:31:18,156 --> 0:31:20,156
Not only that, you can also load

931
00:31:20,156 --> 0:31:22,276
data through blob URLs, which

932
00:31:22,276 --> 0:31:23,716
are more efficient compared to

933
00:31:23,716 --> 0:31:25,586
data URIs since they do not need

934
00:31:25,586 --> 0:31:27,426
to be base 64 encoded.

935
00:31:28,616 --> 0:31:30,816
The blob URL is never manually

936
00:31:30,816 --> 0:31:32,566
created and always generated

937
00:31:32,566 --> 0:31:34,046
through an API like drag and

938
00:31:34,046 --> 0:31:36,576
drop, file upload, or URL

939
00:31:36,576 --> 0:31:36,996
download.

940
00:31:37,556 --> 0:31:40,846
We've heard from developers the

941
00:31:40,946 --> 0:31:42,606
desire to customize a viewing

942
00:31:42,606 --> 0:31:44,076
experience within AR Quick Look.

943
00:31:44,256 --> 0:31:46,566
So, starting with iOS 13, we're

944
00:31:46,646 --> 0:31:48,376
introducing two customization

945
00:31:48,376 --> 0:31:50,106
options that you can modify to

946
00:31:50,226 --> 0:31:51,896
tailor the viewer to best fit

947
00:31:51,896 --> 0:31:53,326
your content and your

948
00:31:53,326 --> 0:31:53,866
application.

949
00:31:54,686 --> 0:31:56,266
Developers can choose to disable

950
00:31:56,266 --> 0:31:58,336
scaling of virtual content for

951
00:31:58,336 --> 0:31:59,396
each model that's being

952
00:31:59,396 --> 0:32:01,436
previewed and also provide a

953
00:31:59,396 --> 0:32:01,436
previewed and also provide a

954
00:32:01,436 --> 0:32:03,456
canonical webpage instead of the

955
00:32:03,456 --> 0:32:05,276
actual 3D model that'll be

956
00:32:05,276 --> 0:32:06,516
shared through the iOS

957
00:32:06,576 --> 0:32:07,076
sharesheet.

958
00:32:08,126 --> 0:32:09,316
So, let's take a look at the

959
00:32:09,316 --> 0:32:11,006
disable content scaling option.

960
00:32:12,636 --> 0:32:14,006
Typically, allowing scaling for

961
00:32:14,006 --> 0:32:15,606
virtual content is a great way

962
00:32:15,656 --> 0:32:17,546
to preview objects at different

963
00:32:17,546 --> 0:32:18,826
sizes and picking the right

964
00:32:18,826 --> 0:32:20,406
dimensions to best see your

965
00:32:20,406 --> 0:32:21,676
content in the environment that

966
00:32:21,676 --> 0:32:22,116
you're in.

967
00:32:23,336 --> 0:32:24,786
However, that's not always the

968
00:32:24,786 --> 0:32:26,546
case, especially when previewing

969
00:32:26,916 --> 0:32:29,296
objects with known fixed sizes

970
00:32:29,696 --> 0:32:30,346
like furniture.

971
00:32:31,886 --> 0:32:32,766
For these type of products, AR

972
00:32:32,766 --> 0:32:34,166
Quick Look makes it really easy

973
00:32:34,286 --> 0:32:36,276
for web and app developers to

974
00:32:36,276 --> 0:32:37,936
disable content scaling so that

975
00:32:37,936 --> 0:32:39,546
users will always view the

976
00:32:39,546 --> 0:32:41,246
object at the correct and

977
00:32:41,246 --> 0:32:42,266
intended size.

978
00:32:43,666 --> 0:32:44,886
So, let's see what this behavior

979
00:32:44,886 --> 0:32:46,346
looks like with this nice dining

980
00:32:46,346 --> 0:32:47,256
room set that I'm sending to

981
00:32:47,256 --> 0:32:47,866
customers.

982
00:32:48,216 --> 0:32:49,706
The set comes in a specific

983
00:32:49,706 --> 0:32:50,726
dimension that cannot be

984
00:32:50,726 --> 0:32:51,296
configured.

985
00:32:52,416 --> 0:32:53,646
You can see as I try to scale

986
00:32:53,646 --> 0:32:54,996
the dining table set larger or

987
00:32:54,996 --> 0:32:56,816
smaller with our two finger

988
00:32:56,816 --> 0:32:58,656
pinch gesture that you're met

989
00:32:58,656 --> 0:33:00,306
with resistance and that the

990
00:32:58,656 --> 0:33:00,306
with resistance and that the

991
00:33:00,306 --> 0:33:01,746
object scales back down to its

992
00:33:01,746 --> 0:33:03,336
true real-world size.

993
00:33:04,486 --> 0:33:06,216
This immediate feedback is super

994
00:33:06,216 --> 0:33:07,756
important to let our customers

995
00:33:07,756 --> 0:33:09,336
know that the object cannot be

996
00:33:09,336 --> 0:33:11,156
scaled and that they're intended

997
00:33:11,156 --> 0:33:13,026
to be viewed at this specific

998
00:33:13,026 --> 0:33:13,366
size.

999
00:33:15,296 --> 0:33:17,486
For the web, the API is exposed

1000
00:33:17,486 --> 0:33:18,956
directly through the URL via the

1001
00:33:18,956 --> 0:33:20,036
fragment identifier.

1002
00:33:20,626 --> 0:33:22,116
The fragment identifier syntax

1003
00:33:22,376 --> 0:33:24,796
starts with a hash mark followed

1004
00:33:24,796 --> 0:33:26,446
by the parameter option to

1005
00:33:26,496 --> 0:33:27,696
customize the AR Quick Look

1006
00:33:27,696 --> 0:33:29,746
experience, and in this case,

1007
00:33:29,976 --> 0:33:31,856
this allows content scaling

1008
00:33:31,856 --> 0:33:32,336
behavior.

1009
00:33:33,486 --> 0:33:34,786
The values to these parameters

1010
00:33:35,156 --> 0:33:36,606
are Boolean values where 0

1011
00:33:36,606 --> 0:33:38,326
represents false, and 1

1012
00:33:38,326 --> 0:33:39,086
represents true.

1013
00:33:40,286 --> 0:33:41,696
When launched AR Quick Look

1014
00:33:41,696 --> 0:33:43,216
processes the fragment

1015
00:33:43,216 --> 0:33:45,116
identifier data and ignores any

1016
00:33:45,116 --> 0:33:48,066
invalid data along with

1017
00:33:48,066 --> 0:33:49,186
parameter names that are not

1018
00:33:49,186 --> 0:33:50,406
defined by the syntax.

1019
00:33:51,246 --> 0:33:52,896
If the original URL does not

1020
00:33:52,896 --> 0:33:54,246
contain a fragment string, AR

1021
00:33:54,436 --> 0:33:56,206
Quick Look will launch and load

1022
00:33:56,206 --> 0:33:58,236
the 3D content for previewing

1023
00:33:58,236 --> 0:33:59,536
using the default behavior,

1024
00:33:59,976 --> 0:34:01,116
which is to allow content

1025
00:33:59,976 --> 0:34:01,116
which is to allow content

1026
00:34:01,116 --> 0:34:01,566
scaling.

1027
00:34:03,096 --> 0:34:04,316
Going through the URL fragment

1028
00:34:04,316 --> 0:34:05,726
identifier allows for future

1029
00:34:05,726 --> 0:34:07,026
customization options and

1030
00:34:07,026 --> 0:34:08,896
enhancements to the 3D content

1031
00:34:08,896 --> 0:34:10,335
previewing experience, as more

1032
00:34:10,335 --> 0:34:11,496
features get added to AR Quick

1033
00:34:11,496 --> 0:34:11,616
Look.

1034
00:34:14,676 --> 0:34:15,966
Another customization option

1035
00:34:15,966 --> 0:34:17,505
that we added is the ability to

1036
00:34:17,505 --> 0:34:18,846
enable sharing the canonical

1037
00:34:18,846 --> 0:34:19,646
webpage URL.

1038
00:34:20,356 --> 0:34:21,795
When challenged and sharing just

1039
00:34:21,795 --> 0:34:23,985
3D model file is the lack of

1040
00:34:24,016 --> 0:34:25,335
context for where that model

1041
00:34:25,335 --> 0:34:25,786
came from.

1042
00:34:26,716 --> 0:34:27,936
I know my colleague Jerry is in

1043
00:34:27,936 --> 0:34:28,926
the market for a new dining

1044
00:34:28,926 --> 0:34:30,856
table, so if I send him an

1045
00:34:30,856 --> 0:34:32,356
iMessage to previous 3D model,

1046
00:34:32,356 --> 0:34:33,676
he has no idea where to buy it

1047
00:34:34,096 --> 0:34:35,596
let alone how much the set even

1048
00:34:35,596 --> 0:34:36,085
costs.

1049
00:34:37,255 --> 0:34:38,666
For retail products, it's better

1050
00:34:38,666 --> 0:34:40,186
to share the link to the product

1051
00:34:40,186 --> 0:34:41,045
description page.

1052
00:34:42,126 --> 0:34:43,456
And by sharing a product link

1053
00:34:43,556 --> 0:34:44,636
instead of a 3D model file

1054
00:34:44,636 --> 0:34:45,886
itself, people can go to the

1055
00:34:45,886 --> 0:34:47,806
source and get not only more

1056
00:34:47,806 --> 0:34:49,076
information but the most

1057
00:34:49,076 --> 0:34:50,646
up-to-date information about the

1058
00:34:50,696 --> 0:34:51,036
product.

1059
00:34:52,356 --> 0:34:53,786
And on iOS 13, AR Quick Look

1060
00:34:53,786 --> 0:34:55,226
will automatically share the URL

1061
00:34:55,226 --> 0:34:57,496
of the originating website for

1062
00:34:57,496 --> 0:34:59,246
the 3D content and applications

1063
00:34:59,246 --> 0:35:00,866
can choose to continue sharing

1064
00:34:59,246 --> 0:35:00,866
can choose to continue sharing

1065
00:35:00,866 --> 0:35:03,356
that 3D model or to provide a

1066
00:35:03,356 --> 0:35:03,906
link instead.

1067
00:35:04,456 --> 0:35:05,386
This is great to get more

1068
00:35:05,386 --> 0:35:07,686
information and learn more about

1069
00:35:08,416 --> 0:35:09,936
the content.

1070
00:35:10,006 --> 0:35:10,596
Now let's take a look at this

1071
00:35:10,596 --> 0:35:11,436
behavior in Safari.

1072
00:35:12,196 --> 0:35:13,176
Here, I'm viewing the guitar

1073
00:35:13,266 --> 0:35:14,356
from the AR Quick Look gallery.

1074
00:35:14,356 --> 0:35:16,036
As I tap on the share button,

1075
00:35:16,176 --> 0:35:17,216
you'll see that were now sharing

1076
00:35:17,216 --> 0:35:18,386
a reference back to the gallery

1077
00:35:18,386 --> 0:35:18,796
website.

1078
00:35:18,796 --> 0:35:21,586
And in Apple News, we're

1079
00:35:21,586 --> 0:35:23,346
automatically sharing the source

1080
00:35:23,466 --> 0:35:24,946
news article as well through the

1081
00:35:24,946 --> 0:35:25,776
iOS share sheet.

1082
00:35:26,236 --> 0:35:27,716
This is great for shareability

1083
00:35:27,916 --> 0:35:30,226
as we pass 3D models around and

1084
00:35:30,226 --> 0:35:32,486
for viewing in AR with even more

1085
00:35:32,486 --> 0:35:33,586
contextual information.

1086
00:35:33,786 --> 0:35:36,576
You can also integrate AR Quick

1087
00:35:36,576 --> 0:35:38,236
Look into your iOS applications.

1088
00:35:38,736 --> 0:35:40,156
It's really easy to integrate

1089
00:35:40,156 --> 0:35:41,296
and get started with viewing 3D

1090
00:35:41,296 --> 0:35:42,586
content and placing them into

1091
00:35:42,586 --> 0:35:42,986
the world.

1092
00:35:44,266 --> 0:35:45,386
Since AR Quick Look is built

1093
00:35:45,386 --> 0:35:46,886
into the OS adopting it gives

1094
00:35:46,886 --> 0:35:49,286
users a familiar, yet consistent

1095
00:35:49,286 --> 0:35:50,356
previewing experience.

1096
00:35:51,296 --> 0:35:52,566
You have full control over the

1097
00:35:52,566 --> 0:35:53,806
view controller frame and

1098
00:35:53,806 --> 0:35:55,456
presentation of AR Quick Look so

1099
00:35:55,456 --> 0:35:56,396
you can put it inline with the

1100
00:35:56,396 --> 0:35:58,286
rest of your app content or

1101
00:35:58,286 --> 0:35:59,316
present it full screen for the

1102
00:35:59,316 --> 0:36:00,286
best experience.

1103
00:35:59,316 --> 0:36:00,286
best experience.

1104
00:36:01,276 --> 0:36:02,966
AR Quick Look is built on top of

1105
00:36:02,966 --> 0:36:04,396
the Quick Look framework to

1106
00:36:04,396 --> 0:36:05,946
preview and present AR content.

1107
00:36:06,666 --> 0:36:07,766
So the same customization

1108
00:36:07,766 --> 0:36:09,136
options that are on the web are

1109
00:36:09,136 --> 0:36:10,506
also available for your apps

1110
00:36:10,506 --> 0:36:11,266
through our new API.

1111
00:36:12,286 --> 0:36:14,546
To do so, use the new AR Quick

1112
00:36:14,546 --> 0:36:15,916
Look preview item class defined

1113
00:36:15,916 --> 0:36:17,326
in the ARKit framework, which

1114
00:36:17,326 --> 0:36:19,016
conforms to the QL previewItem.

1115
00:36:19,816 --> 0:36:20,946
Simply conform to the

1116
00:36:20,946 --> 0:36:22,546
QLPreviewController data source

1117
00:36:22,546 --> 0:36:24,086
protocol and return an instance

1118
00:36:24,126 --> 0:36:25,896
of an AR QL preview item.

1119
00:36:27,046 --> 0:36:28,656
To create one, pass in the file

1120
00:36:28,656 --> 0:36:30,346
URL of the 3D content that you

1121
00:36:30,346 --> 0:36:30,886
wish to view.

1122
00:36:32,376 --> 0:36:33,526
And now, you can optionally

1123
00:36:33,526 --> 0:36:34,626
customize and provide the

1124
00:36:34,656 --> 0:36:37,206
canonical website URL use of

1125
00:36:37,206 --> 0:36:39,046
sharing within AR Quick Look and

1126
00:36:39,046 --> 0:36:40,906
whether to allow content scaling

1127
00:36:40,906 --> 0:36:42,516
of the virtual content, all

1128
00:36:42,516 --> 0:36:43,686
similar to the web fragment

1129
00:36:43,686 --> 0:36:44,396
identifier method.

1130
00:36:45,436 --> 0:36:46,666
This provides a consistent

1131
00:36:46,936 --> 0:36:48,976
developer and API story for both

1132
00:36:48,976 --> 0:36:50,316
web and iOS applications.

1133
00:36:51,926 --> 0:36:53,396
We have a new documentation and

1134
00:36:53,476 --> 0:36:54,536
resources where you can learn

1135
00:36:54,536 --> 0:36:55,786
more about the APIs that we've

1136
00:36:55,786 --> 0:36:57,216
covered along with details on

1137
00:36:57,266 --> 0:36:58,416
how to enable AR Quick Look in

1138
00:36:58,466 --> 0:36:59,656
your application and website.

1139
00:37:00,176 --> 0:37:01,216
So, check out this link, which

1140
00:37:01,216 --> 0:37:02,316
can be found on the developer

1141
00:37:02,316 --> 0:37:02,646
portal.

1142
00:37:04,686 --> 0:37:06,406
Augmented reality is a really

1143
00:37:06,406 --> 0:37:08,076
powerful way to visualize

1144
00:37:08,076 --> 0:37:09,266
furniture and see how they fit

1145
00:37:09,266 --> 0:37:10,056
within your space.

1146
00:37:10,276 --> 0:37:11,386
So, I'll be showing you how to

1147
00:37:11,386 --> 0:37:13,016
decorate a kid's bedroom with

1148
00:37:13,076 --> 0:37:14,146
these six items.

1149
00:37:17,616 --> 0:37:19,226
So, as you can see here, there

1150
00:37:19,226 --> 0:37:21,236
are two picture frames, a

1151
00:37:21,236 --> 0:37:26,286
basket, a nightstand, a bed, and

1152
00:37:26,286 --> 0:37:27,046
a bookshelf.

1153
00:37:27,416 --> 0:37:29,456
And all of these object are

1154
00:37:29,456 --> 0:37:31,656
packaged together in a single

1155
00:37:31,656 --> 0:37:34,836
nested USDZ file.

1156
00:37:35,316 --> 0:37:36,776
So let's get started moving this

1157
00:37:36,776 --> 0:37:36,986
bed.

1158
00:37:37,806 --> 0:37:38,786
You can see how I'm able to

1159
00:37:38,786 --> 0:37:40,046
freely move the bed that's

1160
00:37:40,046 --> 0:37:41,666
contained in this multiple model

1161
00:37:41,666 --> 0:37:44,016
file independently to my desired

1162
00:37:44,016 --> 0:37:44,846
location in the room.

1163
00:37:46,666 --> 0:37:47,546
Let's go ahead and grab the

1164
00:37:47,546 --> 0:37:48,946
picture frames, that's on the

1165
00:37:48,946 --> 0:37:50,796
left, and move them closer to

1166
00:37:50,796 --> 0:37:51,126
us.

1167
00:37:51,656 --> 0:37:52,776
With two fingers, you can see

1168
00:37:52,776 --> 0:37:54,076
that we support multimodel

1169
00:37:54,076 --> 0:37:55,736
translation, leveraging the

1170
00:37:55,786 --> 0:37:56,676
power of multitouch.

1171
00:37:57,246 --> 0:37:58,646
This is great for quickly moving

1172
00:37:58,646 --> 0:38:00,026
objects around in the world.

1173
00:37:58,646 --> 0:38:00,026
objects around in the world.

1174
00:38:00,656 --> 0:38:04,296
I will now touch and drag my

1175
00:38:04,296 --> 0:38:05,696
favorite picture from the floor

1176
00:38:05,906 --> 0:38:07,406
and anchor it so that it sits

1177
00:38:07,516 --> 0:38:08,316
right above the bed.

1178
00:38:09,086 --> 0:38:11,006
This is all possible now because

1179
00:38:11,006 --> 0:38:12,596
by default AR Quick Look detects

1180
00:38:12,596 --> 0:38:14,016
and supports placing objects on

1181
00:38:14,016 --> 0:38:15,386
both horizontal and vertical

1182
00:38:15,386 --> 0:38:16,036
surfaces.

1183
00:38:16,486 --> 0:38:20,116
Now let's figure the best place

1184
00:38:20,296 --> 0:38:21,446
to put my bookshelf.

1185
00:38:21,856 --> 0:38:23,226
I'll grab the bookshelf and

1186
00:38:23,346 --> 0:38:25,196
first place it onto the wall.

1187
00:38:26,696 --> 0:38:29,196
Now, I really need to compare

1188
00:38:29,196 --> 0:38:30,736
where the best spot for it is,

1189
00:38:30,976 --> 0:38:32,526
so let's place it back onto the

1190
00:38:32,526 --> 0:38:32,916
floor.

1191
00:38:34,156 --> 0:38:35,626
So now I'm thinking, I want as

1192
00:38:35,626 --> 0:38:36,936
much floor space for the kid as

1193
00:38:36,936 --> 0:38:38,616
they grow up and as they collect

1194
00:38:38,616 --> 0:38:39,146
more items.

1195
00:38:39,796 --> 0:38:40,876
So let's keep it onto the wall

1196
00:38:40,876 --> 0:38:41,776
since it really matches the

1197
00:38:41,776 --> 0:38:43,996
setting of the picture frame and

1198
00:38:43,996 --> 0:38:44,816
the rest of my layout.

1199
00:38:45,856 --> 0:38:47,386
I'm able to quickly make these

1200
00:38:47,586 --> 0:38:49,236
decisions and see what objects

1201
00:38:49,236 --> 0:38:50,636
look like in my room with the

1202
00:38:50,636 --> 0:38:52,356
new support in AR Quick Look for

1203
00:38:52,426 --> 0:38:54,076
easily moving between horizontal

1204
00:38:54,076 --> 0:38:55,046
and vertical surfaces.

1205
00:38:55,596 --> 0:38:57,796
So, let's tidy up the rest of

1206
00:38:57,796 --> 0:39:00,016
this scene by moving the

1207
00:38:57,796 --> 0:39:00,016
this scene by moving the

1208
00:39:00,016 --> 0:39:01,216
remaining objects, which is the

1209
00:39:01,216 --> 0:39:04,686
basket, and over to the right

1210
00:39:04,926 --> 0:39:05,726
near the bookshelf.

1211
00:39:10,076 --> 0:39:12,026
I'll also do the same thing with

1212
00:39:12,026 --> 0:39:13,186
the nightstand and a picture

1213
00:39:13,186 --> 0:39:14,486
frame but move it to the left

1214
00:39:14,486 --> 0:39:14,976
side of the bed.

1215
00:39:29,046 --> 0:39:30,306
And as Jerry mentioned, there's

1216
00:39:30,306 --> 0:39:32,086
a new levity gesture, and this

1217
00:39:32,086 --> 0:39:33,676
is extremely powerful for not

1218
00:39:33,676 --> 0:39:35,066
only seeing the underside of the

1219
00:39:35,066 --> 0:39:36,356
objects but also lifting the

1220
00:39:36,356 --> 0:39:36,976
object up.

1221
00:39:37,546 --> 0:39:39,076
So I'll go ahead and lift the

1222
00:39:39,076 --> 0:39:40,356
picture frame to be slightly

1223
00:39:40,356 --> 0:39:41,866
above the nightstand and move it

1224
00:39:41,866 --> 0:39:43,436
so that it's positioned just on

1225
00:39:43,536 --> 0:39:44,316
top of the stand.

1226
00:39:45,316 --> 0:39:47,026
Lastly, I'll rotate the frame so

1227
00:39:47,026 --> 0:39:48,626
it's angled towards the bed for

1228
00:39:48,626 --> 0:39:50,466
a nice finishing touch.

1229
00:39:51,716 --> 0:39:53,996
And now, let's take a look at

1230
00:39:53,996 --> 0:39:55,086
the final shot of the kid's

1231
00:39:55,086 --> 0:39:56,456
bedroom scene that we've just

1232
00:39:57,076 --> 0:39:57,186
made.

1233
00:40:00,196 --> 0:40:02,216
This looks absolutely incredible

1234
00:40:02,216 --> 0:40:03,626
as a prime example of a retail

1235
00:40:03,626 --> 0:40:04,776
experience that can be enabled

1236
00:40:04,776 --> 0:40:05,496
in AR Quick Look.

1237
00:40:06,276 --> 0:40:07,976
But you might be thinking, I

1238
00:40:07,976 --> 0:40:09,246
really wish there was an easy

1239
00:40:09,246 --> 0:40:10,556
way for me to buy this after

1240
00:40:10,556 --> 0:40:11,976
seeing this in my own space.

1241
00:40:13,036 --> 0:40:14,066
And you weren't alone in

1242
00:40:14,066 --> 0:40:14,656
thinking that.

1243
00:40:15,086 --> 0:40:16,336
We've learned that over the last

1244
00:40:16,336 --> 0:40:17,456
year from retailers that when

1245
00:40:17,456 --> 0:40:19,106
customers see their products in

1246
00:40:19,106 --> 0:40:20,266
their own space, they have

1247
00:40:20,266 --> 0:40:21,826
significantly more confidence in

1248
00:40:21,826 --> 0:40:23,446
their purchase, which is great

1249
00:40:23,446 --> 0:40:25,426
for customers and great for

1250
00:40:25,426 --> 0:40:25,976
businesses.

1251
00:40:26,776 --> 0:40:28,186
So, this year, we are adding a

1252
00:40:28,186 --> 0:40:29,576
support for a customizable call

1253
00:40:29,576 --> 0:40:31,026
to action in AR Quick Look

1254
00:40:31,206 --> 0:40:33,146
including direct support for

1255
00:40:33,586 --> 0:40:34,816
Apple Pay.

1256
00:40:36,136 --> 0:40:37,806
With Apple Pay support directly

1257
00:40:37,806 --> 0:40:38,766
in AR Quick Look, users can

1258
00:40:38,766 --> 0:40:40,706
purchase the actual objects that

1259
00:40:40,706 --> 0:40:41,786
they just previewed in the world

1260
00:40:41,786 --> 0:40:43,606
with just a single tap.

1261
00:40:44,196 --> 0:40:45,776
So, what does this actually look

1262
00:40:45,776 --> 0:40:45,876
like?

1263
00:40:46,256 --> 0:40:47,476
There's a brand-new view located

1264
00:40:47,476 --> 0:40:48,486
at the bottom of AR Quick Look

1265
00:40:48,486 --> 0:40:50,496
with two fields, a title and a

1266
00:40:50,496 --> 0:40:52,516
subtitle that you can customize

1267
00:40:52,516 --> 0:40:53,526
separately to match your

1268
00:40:53,526 --> 0:40:53,836
workflow.

1269
00:40:54,846 --> 0:40:56,036
The title can describe what it

1270
00:40:56,036 --> 0:40:57,006
is that the user is looking at

1271
00:40:57,006 --> 0:40:58,346
to buy and you can use a

1272
00:40:58,346 --> 0:40:59,406
subtitle field to include the

1273
00:40:59,476 --> 0:41:01,196
price and product description.

1274
00:40:59,476 --> 0:41:01,196
price and product description.

1275
00:41:02,646 --> 0:41:03,956
Underneath the text field is a

1276
00:41:03,956 --> 0:41:05,206
reference to the canonical web

1277
00:41:05,206 --> 0:41:06,726
domain name to show you where

1278
00:41:06,726 --> 0:41:07,756
the product can be found.

1279
00:41:08,436 --> 0:41:09,606
And on the right, you can

1280
00:41:09,606 --> 0:41:10,896
provide your own call to action,

1281
00:41:10,936 --> 0:41:13,796
such as active cart and checkout

1282
00:41:14,796 --> 0:41:16,356
along with using any Apple Pay

1283
00:41:16,356 --> 0:41:17,486
button with varying different

1284
00:41:17,486 --> 0:41:19,386
styles to best fit and match

1285
00:41:19,556 --> 0:41:20,466
your shopping workflow.

1286
00:41:21,706 --> 0:41:22,846
So this great feature will be

1287
00:41:22,846 --> 0:41:24,346
available later this fall, and

1288
00:41:24,986 --> 0:41:26,206
we are excited to share that

1289
00:41:26,206 --> 0:41:27,536
Warby Parker will be offering

1290
00:41:27,536 --> 0:41:28,896
virtual try-on in their website

1291
00:41:28,896 --> 0:41:30,276
once Apple Pay support and AR

1292
00:41:30,276 --> 0:41:31,836
Quick Look is available later

1293
00:41:31,836 --> 0:41:32,186
this year.

1294
00:41:33,246 --> 0:41:34,586
Warby Parker was the first to

1295
00:41:34,586 --> 0:41:35,876
offer virtual try-on in their

1296
00:41:35,876 --> 0:41:37,356
app, and we're excited with the

1297
00:41:37,356 --> 0:41:38,626
new updates to AR Quick Look and

1298
00:41:38,696 --> 0:41:40,456
iOS 13 they will be extending

1299
00:41:40,456 --> 0:41:41,926
their virtual try-on to their

1300
00:41:41,926 --> 0:41:42,326
website.

1301
00:41:42,956 --> 0:41:44,066
We can't wait to see how other

1302
00:41:44,066 --> 0:41:45,416
merchants integrate this into

1303
00:41:45,416 --> 0:41:46,586
their retail workflow.

1304
00:41:48,236 --> 0:41:49,766
Now, a majority of these models

1305
00:41:49,766 --> 0:41:51,856
that we've seen from the keynote

1306
00:41:52,046 --> 0:41:53,636
and this session can be found on

1307
00:41:53,636 --> 0:41:54,576
our updated AR Quick Look

1308
00:41:54,576 --> 0:41:55,216
gallery page.

1309
00:41:55,836 --> 0:41:57,046
Here, you'll find a range of

1310
00:41:57,046 --> 0:41:58,676
static and animated models that

1311
00:41:58,676 --> 0:42:00,036
you can play with, and we'll be

1312
00:41:58,676 --> 0:42:00,036
you can play with, and we'll be

1313
00:42:00,036 --> 0:42:01,656
adding reality files soon.

1314
00:42:02,316 --> 0:42:03,606
So, if you have iOS 13 on the

1315
00:42:03,606 --> 0:42:05,206
device, visit this gallery page,

1316
00:42:05,416 --> 0:42:06,686
tap on a 3D model, and give them

1317
00:42:06,686 --> 0:42:06,996
a try.

1318
00:42:06,996 --> 0:42:09,686
And also, if you didn't get the

1319
00:42:09,686 --> 0:42:10,796
opportunity to check out the Mac

1320
00:42:10,896 --> 0:42:12,616
Pro or the Pro Display XDR in

1321
00:42:12,646 --> 0:42:13,596
person from earlier in the

1322
00:42:13,596 --> 0:42:15,456
conference, don't fret.

1323
00:42:16,086 --> 0:42:17,226
You can view these products in

1324
00:42:17,226 --> 0:42:18,616
AR Quick Look and see what they

1325
00:42:18,616 --> 0:42:19,756
look like in your workspace.

1326
00:42:20,276 --> 0:42:21,306
The models can be found on their

1327
00:42:21,306 --> 0:42:22,946
respective product pages.

1328
00:42:24,296 --> 0:42:25,986
A Python script to create these

1329
00:42:25,986 --> 0:42:27,646
nested USDZ files will be

1330
00:42:27,646 --> 0:42:29,166
available soon on the AR Quick

1331
00:42:29,166 --> 0:42:30,856
Look gallery page under the USDZ

1332
00:42:30,856 --> 0:42:31,706
tools section.

1333
00:42:32,366 --> 0:42:35,276
So, in summary, we've added a

1334
00:42:35,466 --> 0:42:36,796
ton of capabilities to AR Quick

1335
00:42:36,796 --> 0:42:37,826
Look this year to provide and

1336
00:42:37,826 --> 0:42:39,206
even more compelling and

1337
00:42:39,206 --> 0:42:41,846
believable experience, to view

1338
00:42:41,846 --> 0:42:42,966
AR content in the real world.

1339
00:42:43,696 --> 0:42:44,606
This started with supporting

1340
00:42:44,606 --> 0:42:45,866
reality files, authored in

1341
00:42:45,866 --> 0:42:47,336
Reality Composer, where we're

1342
00:42:47,336 --> 0:42:48,646
able to reflect the richness

1343
00:42:48,686 --> 0:42:50,356
that reality kit provides, like

1344
00:42:50,356 --> 0:42:52,196
more anchor types, such as Face

1345
00:42:52,556 --> 0:42:54,486
and Real World images and

1346
00:42:54,486 --> 0:42:56,426
interactive content behaviors

1347
00:42:56,646 --> 0:42:57,966
through the use of triggers and

1348
00:42:57,966 --> 0:42:58,496
actions.

1349
00:42:59,376 --> 0:43:00,586
We've made the content belong

1350
00:42:59,376 --> 0:43:00,586
We've made the content belong

1351
00:43:00,586 --> 0:43:01,646
with the world with new

1352
00:43:01,646 --> 0:43:02,646
rendering effects like depth of

1353
00:43:02,646 --> 0:43:05,216
field, motion blur, and people

1354
00:43:05,216 --> 0:43:05,536
occlusion.

1355
00:43:06,686 --> 0:43:07,786
We also enhance the viewing

1356
00:43:07,786 --> 0:43:09,166
experience with new levity

1357
00:43:09,166 --> 0:43:10,796
gestures and built-in animation

1358
00:43:10,796 --> 0:43:12,026
scrubber to allow you to have

1359
00:43:12,096 --> 0:43:13,876
better control over the content

1360
00:43:13,876 --> 0:43:15,076
and its animation sequence.

1361
00:43:16,436 --> 0:43:17,936
We've introduced a new API on

1362
00:43:17,936 --> 0:43:19,426
both the web and iOS to allow

1363
00:43:19,426 --> 0:43:21,156
developers to better customize

1364
00:43:21,156 --> 0:43:22,206
