00:00:06,536 --> 0:00:08,846
&gt;&gt; Hello, I'm Tim Hatcher an

3
00:00:08,846 --> 0:00:10,066
engineer on the WebKit Team.

4
00:00:10,866 --> 0:00:11,886
I'm going to talk about

5
00:00:11,886 --> 0:00:13,406
Supporting Dark Mode in Web

6
00:00:13,406 --> 0:00:13,876
Content.

7
00:00:16,046 --> 0:00:18,036
When macOS Mojave introduced

8
00:00:18,036 --> 0:00:20,056
Dark Mode, users and developers

9
00:00:20,056 --> 0:00:21,926
naturally began to ask about web

10
00:00:21,926 --> 0:00:22,766
content.

11
00:00:23,806 --> 0:00:25,766
Over the decades web content has

12
00:00:25,766 --> 0:00:27,166
traditionally been light in

13
00:00:27,166 --> 0:00:29,356
color leading to a very bright

14
00:00:29,356 --> 0:00:30,966
experience when mixed among

15
00:00:30,966 --> 0:00:32,716
newly Dark Mode aware apps.

16
00:00:34,416 --> 0:00:36,036
The WebKit team has been working

17
00:00:36,036 --> 0:00:37,306
to standardize a way for

18
00:00:37,306 --> 0:00:39,416
developers to style web content

19
00:00:39,416 --> 0:00:41,486
for Dark Mode, which I'm happy

20
00:00:41,486 --> 0:00:43,026
to announce is available in

21
00:00:43,026 --> 0:00:45,786
Safari 12.1 on macOS Mojave and

22
00:00:48,516 --> 0:00:50,876
with iOS 13's system wide dark

23
00:00:50,876 --> 0:00:53,266
appearance, you will see the

24
00:00:53,266 --> 0:00:54,996
same Dark Mode styling for web

25
00:00:54,996 --> 0:00:57,106
content in Safari for iOS.

26
00:00:59,596 --> 0:01:01,116
Throughout this video I'll be

27
00:00:59,596 --> 0:01:01,116
Throughout this video I'll be

28
00:01:01,116 --> 0:01:03,486
using Safari in my examples, but

29
00:01:03,486 --> 0:01:04,566
this support is not just

30
00:01:04,566 --> 0:01:05,706
available in Safari.

31
00:01:06,206 --> 0:01:08,936
It is also available in mail and

32
00:01:08,936 --> 0:01:10,806
in your app when showing content

33
00:01:10,806 --> 0:01:11,636
in web views.

34
00:01:13,726 --> 0:01:15,056
There are three areas I want to

35
00:01:15,056 --> 0:01:16,006
cover in this video.

36
00:01:16,606 --> 0:01:18,826
One, general styling support for

37
00:01:18,826 --> 0:01:19,836
Dark Mode on the web.

38
00:01:20,636 --> 0:01:23,296
Two, some specific cases that

39
00:01:23,296 --> 0:01:24,696
apply to email messages.

40
00:01:25,496 --> 0:01:27,146
And, three, tools you can use to

41
00:01:27,146 --> 0:01:28,966
debug web content in Dark Mode.

42
00:01:31,396 --> 0:01:32,266
Let's get started.

43
00:01:32,796 --> 0:01:35,986
I've been working on a new blog

44
00:01:35,986 --> 0:01:37,526
to document some recent trips

45
00:01:37,526 --> 0:01:38,896
I've taken around California.

46
00:01:40,956 --> 0:01:42,376
While designing the site to be

47
00:01:42,376 --> 0:01:43,816
responsive for mobile and

48
00:01:43,816 --> 0:01:45,976
desktop visitors, this would be

49
00:01:45,976 --> 0:01:47,586
a good time to add support for

50
00:01:47,586 --> 0:01:48,276
Dark Mode.

51
00:01:48,826 --> 0:01:50,446
Dark mode can be viewed as a

52
00:01:50,446 --> 0:01:52,026
progression of responsive web

53
00:01:52,026 --> 0:01:54,646
design, another way to adapt to

54
00:01:54,646 --> 0:01:56,746
the circumstances of the device.

55
00:01:57,606 --> 0:01:59,416
It is important to note that

56
00:01:59,416 --> 0:02:01,336
Safari and WebKit will not auto

57
00:01:59,416 --> 0:02:01,336
Safari and WebKit will not auto

58
00:02:01,336 --> 0:02:02,506
darken your content.

59
00:02:02,506 --> 0:02:04,716
As the web developer, you are in

60
00:02:04,716 --> 0:02:06,536
control of how your content will

61
00:02:06,536 --> 0:02:08,756
appear to users using the dark

62
00:02:08,756 --> 0:02:09,795
system appearance.

63
00:02:10,326 --> 0:02:12,236
Let's take a look at how we can

64
00:02:12,236 --> 0:02:14,846
transform this light page design

65
00:02:14,876 --> 0:02:16,546
into a Dark Mode ready site.

66
00:02:17,596 --> 0:02:18,866
The main way to signal that your

67
00:02:18,866 --> 0:02:20,986
content supports Dark Mode is to

68
00:02:20,986 --> 0:02:22,996
adopt the new color scheme style

69
00:02:22,996 --> 0:02:24,716
property currently being

70
00:02:24,716 --> 0:02:26,986
specified for inclusion in the

71
00:02:26,986 --> 0:02:28,226
CSS standard.

72
00:02:28,226 --> 0:02:31,016
Specifying the values light and

73
00:02:31,016 --> 0:02:32,896
dark on the root element lets

74
00:02:32,896 --> 0:02:34,416
the rendering engine known both

75
00:02:34,416 --> 0:02:35,646
modes are supported by the

76
00:02:35,646 --> 0:02:36,456
document.

77
00:02:37,196 --> 0:02:39,046
This changes the default text

78
00:02:39,046 --> 0:02:40,216
and background colors of the

79
00:02:40,216 --> 0:02:42,386
page to match the current system

80
00:02:42,386 --> 0:02:44,436
appearance, standard form

81
00:02:44,436 --> 0:02:47,116
controls, scrollbars and other

82
00:02:47,116 --> 0:02:49,236
named system colors also change

83
00:02:49,236 --> 0:02:50,376
their look automatically.

84
00:02:51,566 --> 0:02:53,246
Let's take a look at how adding

85
00:02:53,246 --> 0:02:54,606
that property to my blog

86
00:02:54,606 --> 0:02:55,556
affected things.

87
00:02:57,346 --> 0:02:59,096
You can see the background color

88
00:02:59,096 --> 0:03:01,126
changed from white to black and

89
00:02:59,096 --> 0:03:01,126
changed from white to black and

90
00:03:01,126 --> 0:03:02,676
most of my text completely

91
00:03:02,676 --> 0:03:03,816
disappeared into the black

92
00:03:03,816 --> 0:03:05,796
background; that was not what I

93
00:03:05,796 --> 0:03:06,576
was expecting.

94
00:03:07,396 --> 0:03:08,746
Let's take a look at some of the

95
00:03:08,746 --> 0:03:11,036
style rules for this page to see

96
00:03:11,036 --> 0:03:11,846
what is happening.

97
00:03:14,216 --> 0:03:15,526
Here are the main style rules

98
00:03:15,526 --> 0:03:16,726
for the affected areas of the

99
00:03:16,726 --> 0:03:17,306
page.

100
00:03:18,906 --> 0:03:20,646
For the text that disappeared

101
00:03:20,646 --> 0:03:22,266
the black was being set as the

102
00:03:22,266 --> 0:03:23,456
text color on the body.

103
00:03:23,816 --> 0:03:25,686
I also have a dark gray text

104
00:03:25,686 --> 0:03:27,406
color for the level 1 headings,

105
00:03:27,746 --> 0:03:28,976
which doesn't have a high enough

106
00:03:28,976 --> 0:03:30,226
contrast with the black

107
00:03:30,226 --> 0:03:30,826
background.

108
00:03:31,616 --> 0:03:33,276
By default, the text color of

109
00:03:33,276 --> 0:03:34,656
the body will be black and light

110
00:03:34,656 --> 0:03:34,966
mode.

111
00:03:36,636 --> 0:03:37,956
Since that is what I wanted on

112
00:03:37,956 --> 0:03:39,786
this page I can just delete the

113
00:03:39,786 --> 0:03:41,506
color property override from my

114
00:03:41,506 --> 0:03:42,416
style sheet.

115
00:03:42,986 --> 0:03:44,366
Now that I'm using the color

116
00:03:44,366 --> 0:03:46,086
scheme property, the default

117
00:03:46,086 --> 0:03:47,556
text and background color will

118
00:03:47,556 --> 0:03:49,426
both automatically change to the

119
00:03:49,426 --> 0:03:50,656
Dark Mode values.

120
00:03:50,956 --> 0:03:53,526
For the other colors in my style

121
00:03:53,526 --> 0:03:55,566
sheet that I want to keep, I can

122
00:03:55,566 --> 0:03:57,336
use something called CSS custom

123
00:03:57,336 --> 0:03:58,976
properties otherwise known as

124
00:03:58,976 --> 0:04:01,206
CSS variables to centrally

125
00:03:58,976 --> 0:04:01,206
CSS variables to centrally

126
00:04:01,206 --> 0:04:02,886
define them for use throughout

127
00:04:02,886 --> 0:04:04,146
my site style sheets.

128
00:04:04,906 --> 0:04:06,846
Using CSS variables makes it

129
00:04:06,846 --> 0:04:08,746
very easy to later adapt the

130
00:04:08,746 --> 0:04:09,976
style sheet for Dark Mode.

131
00:04:10,786 --> 0:04:11,976
Let's see how that will work.

132
00:04:14,226 --> 0:04:16,016
We simply take the color values

133
00:04:16,086 --> 0:04:17,875
and move them to a central place

134
00:04:18,236 --> 0:04:19,606
like the root element rule we

135
00:04:19,606 --> 0:04:21,125
added for the color scheme

136
00:04:21,366 --> 0:04:21,776
earlier.

137
00:04:23,666 --> 0:04:25,846
For these colors we define a

138
00:04:25,846 --> 0:04:27,826
variable name signified by a

139
00:04:27,826 --> 0:04:29,356
double hyphen prefix.

140
00:04:30,906 --> 0:04:33,086
Now we can return to the

141
00:04:33,086 --> 0:04:35,136
original style rules where I am

142
00:04:35,136 --> 0:04:36,816
still using the static color

143
00:04:36,816 --> 0:04:40,366
values and change them to use

144
00:04:40,366 --> 0:04:41,596
the variables we defined

145
00:04:41,946 --> 0:04:44,046
referencing them by name using

146
00:04:44,046 --> 0:04:45,876
the VAR function which looks

147
00:04:45,876 --> 0:04:46,466
like this.

148
00:04:47,076 --> 0:04:48,906
This style sheet is now ready to

149
00:04:48,906 --> 0:04:50,706
support a dark color scheme.

150
00:04:53,316 --> 0:04:54,586
Like responsive design

151
00:04:54,586 --> 0:04:56,366
breakpoints for different device

152
00:04:56,366 --> 0:04:58,336
widths, we can use a media query

153
00:04:58,336 --> 0:05:00,436
to conditionalize for Dark Mode.

154
00:04:58,336 --> 0:05:00,436
to conditionalize for Dark Mode.

155
00:05:00,836 --> 0:05:02,726
Specifically, if the user

156
00:05:02,726 --> 0:05:04,486
currently prefers a dark color

157
00:05:04,486 --> 0:05:04,996
scheme.

158
00:05:08,366 --> 0:05:10,106
We can override the same CSS

159
00:05:10,106 --> 0:05:11,636
variables we defined earlier for

160
00:05:11,636 --> 0:05:13,996
light mode with Dark Mode

161
00:05:13,996 --> 0:05:15,436
appropriate color values.

162
00:05:16,076 --> 0:05:17,186
Now let's take a look at what

163
00:05:17,186 --> 0:05:18,556
the page looks like with these

164
00:05:18,556 --> 0:05:19,456
changes applied.

165
00:05:20,566 --> 0:05:22,436
We go from this where we only

166
00:05:22,436 --> 0:05:23,976
added the color scheme property

167
00:05:25,166 --> 0:05:26,936
to this where the text and

168
00:05:26,936 --> 0:05:29,196
header colors properly adapt to

169
00:05:29,196 --> 0:05:31,026
the dark appearance, but what

170
00:05:31,026 --> 0:05:31,926
about images?

171
00:05:32,346 --> 0:05:33,866
Like the hero picture here of

172
00:05:33,866 --> 0:05:34,836
the Mojave Desert.

173
00:05:36,096 --> 0:05:37,996
The Mojave Desert image is

174
00:05:37,996 --> 0:05:39,456
included by an image element

175
00:05:39,506 --> 0:05:41,266
that is sourcing a JPEG on my

176
00:05:41,266 --> 0:05:41,746
server.

177
00:05:42,396 --> 0:05:44,116
We can easily adapt this code

178
00:05:44,146 --> 0:05:46,026
using another responsive design

179
00:05:46,026 --> 0:05:46,556
technique.

180
00:05:47,876 --> 0:05:49,086
Specifically, the picture

181
00:05:49,086 --> 0:05:50,696
element, which is a great way to

182
00:05:50,696 --> 0:05:52,336
source multiple versions of an

183
00:05:52,336 --> 0:05:54,456
image based on various device

184
00:05:54,456 --> 0:05:56,796
characteristics using the same

185
00:05:56,796 --> 0:05:57,736
media queries.

186
00:05:58,256 --> 0:06:00,316
Here I specify an alternate

187
00:05:58,256 --> 0:06:00,316
Here I specify an alternate

188
00:06:00,316 --> 0:06:01,976
image of the Mojave Desert at

189
00:06:01,976 --> 0:06:04,206
night using the same media query

190
00:06:04,206 --> 0:06:05,496
that was used earlier for the

191
00:06:05,496 --> 0:06:07,256
Dark Mode colors I can

192
00:06:07,256 --> 0:06:09,256
conditionally load a night image

193
00:06:09,256 --> 0:06:11,096
for users that prefer a dark

194
00:06:11,096 --> 0:06:12,096
color scheme.

195
00:06:13,196 --> 0:06:15,076
So we go from this where I was

196
00:06:15,076 --> 0:06:16,576
using one image for both color

197
00:06:16,576 --> 0:06:19,406
schemes to this where the desert

198
00:06:19,406 --> 0:06:20,986
image is adapted to the dark

199
00:06:20,986 --> 0:06:23,336
appearance and now the site is

200
00:06:23,336 --> 0:06:26,356
ready for both dark and light

201
00:06:26,356 --> 0:06:27,196
appearances.

202
00:06:29,036 --> 0:06:31,216
To recap you want to use the new

203
00:06:31,216 --> 0:06:32,886
color scheme property to declare

204
00:06:32,886 --> 0:06:34,346
support for light and Dark

205
00:06:34,346 --> 0:06:34,846
Modes.

206
00:06:35,266 --> 0:06:36,646
This informs the rendering

207
00:06:36,646 --> 0:06:38,516
engine what color schemes your

208
00:06:38,516 --> 0:06:40,866
content was designed for so it

209
00:06:40,866 --> 0:06:43,116
can adapt the default colors and

210
00:06:43,116 --> 0:06:44,326
controls to match.

211
00:06:47,166 --> 0:06:48,836
When the default colors are not

212
00:06:49,066 --> 0:06:49,916
enough, use the

213
00:06:49,916 --> 0:06:51,556
prefers-color-scheme media query

214
00:06:51,556 --> 0:06:52,766
for custom values.

215
00:06:54,026 --> 0:06:55,656
You can use the same media query

216
00:06:55,796 --> 0:06:57,216
along with other responsive

217
00:06:57,216 --> 0:06:59,426
images in the picture element

218
00:06:59,426 --> 0:07:02,116
for Dark Mode ready sources and

219
00:06:59,426 --> 0:07:02,116
for Dark Mode ready sources and

220
00:07:02,116 --> 0:07:04,806
consider using CSS variables

221
00:07:05,086 --> 0:07:06,646
when adopting color schemes.

222
00:07:06,816 --> 0:07:08,406
It will be easier to maintain

223
00:07:08,406 --> 0:07:10,356
both appearance modes across

224
00:07:10,356 --> 0:07:10,976
your content.

225
00:07:12,116 --> 0:07:13,796
That brings us to Dark Mode and

226
00:07:13,796 --> 0:07:14,746
email messages.

227
00:07:16,026 --> 0:07:18,156
Just like mail in macOS Mohave

228
00:07:18,306 --> 0:07:20,156
simple email messages composed

229
00:07:20,156 --> 0:07:22,786
directly in mail on iOS 13 are

230
00:07:22,786 --> 0:07:24,936
ready to go in both light and

231
00:07:24,936 --> 0:07:27,196
dark appearances even if they

232
00:07:27,196 --> 0:07:28,306
include in-line image

233
00:07:28,306 --> 0:07:29,736
attachments like you see here.

234
00:07:30,666 --> 0:07:32,356
This is the case because of

235
00:07:32,356 --> 0:07:33,606
mail's auto darkening

236
00:07:33,606 --> 0:07:35,936
transformations that get applied

237
00:07:36,226 --> 0:07:38,056
to these simple email messages.

238
00:07:40,176 --> 0:07:42,246
However, if you are an email

239
00:07:42,246 --> 0:07:43,866
template designer creating

240
00:07:43,866 --> 0:07:45,546
designs for a campaign that

241
00:07:45,546 --> 0:07:47,476
includes remotely loaded images,

242
00:07:48,056 --> 0:07:49,376
you will need to adopt the same

243
00:07:49,376 --> 0:07:50,966
styling techniques I covered

244
00:07:50,966 --> 0:07:52,606
earlier for web content.

245
00:07:53,276 --> 0:07:54,506
Without adopting the color

246
00:07:54,506 --> 0:07:56,076
scheme property mail will

247
00:07:56,076 --> 0:07:57,786
display your email message in

248
00:07:57,786 --> 0:07:59,366
the light appearance and will

249
00:07:59,366 --> 0:08:01,246
not employ any auto darkening

250
00:07:59,366 --> 0:08:01,246
not employ any auto darkening

251
00:08:01,246 --> 0:08:03,166
transformations that simple

252
00:08:03,166 --> 0:08:04,516
email messages receive.

253
00:08:05,696 --> 0:08:07,706
Here is the same email message

254
00:08:07,836 --> 0:08:10,266
with Dark Mode styling including

255
00:08:10,266 --> 0:08:11,736
the color scheme declaration.

256
00:08:12,236 --> 0:08:13,946
It is now perfectly adapted to

257
00:08:13,946 --> 0:08:15,356
the dark system appearance.

258
00:08:16,766 --> 0:08:19,296
To recap simple email messages

259
00:08:19,296 --> 0:08:20,996
will auto darken even if they

260
00:08:20,996 --> 0:08:22,106
include in-line image

261
00:08:22,106 --> 0:08:24,556
attachments and rich email

262
00:08:24,556 --> 0:08:27,256
messages with remote images like

263
00:08:27,256 --> 0:08:29,226
custom email marketing campaigns

264
00:08:29,426 --> 0:08:31,086
will use the light color scheme

265
00:08:31,086 --> 0:08:31,846
by default.

266
00:08:32,946 --> 0:08:34,405
You can declare support for the

267
00:08:34,405 --> 0:08:36,106
dark color scheme in your

268
00:08:36,106 --> 0:08:38,476
marketing email messages and use

269
00:08:38,476 --> 0:08:40,376
the media query for custom color

270
00:08:40,416 --> 0:08:41,876
and image customizations.

271
00:08:43,936 --> 0:08:45,666
Now let's talk about tools to

272
00:08:45,666 --> 0:08:46,916
debug Dark Mode content

273
00:08:46,916 --> 0:08:48,676
specifically Web Inspector.

274
00:08:49,806 --> 0:08:51,386
In macOS, we added the dark

275
00:08:51,386 --> 0:08:53,306
appearance to Web Inspector when

276
00:08:53,306 --> 0:08:54,806
your system is in Dark Mode.

277
00:08:55,316 --> 0:08:57,186
This was a very popular request

278
00:08:57,186 --> 0:08:58,806
from web developers, and I'm

279
00:08:58,806 --> 0:09:00,426
very happy we have it now.

280
00:08:58,806 --> 0:09:00,426
very happy we have it now.

281
00:09:01,896 --> 0:09:03,296
Not only did we add the dark

282
00:09:03,296 --> 0:09:04,796
appearance there are a couple

283
00:09:04,796 --> 0:09:06,496
tools to help you debug your own

284
00:09:06,496 --> 0:09:07,776
content in Dark Mode.

285
00:09:08,456 --> 0:09:10,626
The first is a new color scheme

286
00:09:10,626 --> 0:09:12,616
toggle in the elements tab that

287
00:09:12,616 --> 0:09:14,276
will change the page appearance

288
00:09:14,556 --> 0:09:16,136
without requiring you to toggle

289
00:09:16,136 --> 0:09:17,696
the entire system appearance

290
00:09:17,696 --> 0:09:18,496
every time.

291
00:09:19,226 --> 0:09:21,096
So if you like using Dark Mode,

292
00:09:21,476 --> 0:09:23,166
you can quickly test how your

293
00:09:23,166 --> 0:09:25,256
pages will look in the light

294
00:09:25,256 --> 0:09:26,726
appearance with this button.

295
00:09:29,146 --> 0:09:31,426
Like before the style sidebar

296
00:09:31,426 --> 0:09:33,146
shows any rules that match for

297
00:09:33,146 --> 0:09:35,526
the selected element including

298
00:09:35,526 --> 0:09:36,716
any media queries.

299
00:09:37,286 --> 0:09:39,476
In this case, you can see the

300
00:09:39,476 --> 0:09:41,176
prefers color scheme media query

301
00:09:41,176 --> 0:09:43,696
definitions of color variables

302
00:09:43,696 --> 0:09:45,196
on the WebKit.org site.

303
00:09:45,576 --> 0:09:48,016
And that is Dark Mode and Web

304
00:09:48,016 --> 0:09:48,656
Inspector.

305
00:09:49,056 --> 0:09:50,346
Check out some of the other

306
00:09:50,346 --> 0:09:52,116
Safari and WebKit sessions for

307
00:09:52,116 --> 0:09:53,836
details about other great new

308
00:09:53,836 --> 0:09:55,836
features in Web Inspector for

309
00:09:55,836 --> 0:09:57,026
Safari 13.

310
00:09:58,136 --> 0:09:59,656
In summary, remember that web

311
00:09:59,656 --> 0:10:01,376
pages and rich email messages

312
00:09:59,656 --> 0:10:01,376
pages and rich email messages

313
00:10:01,376 --> 0:10:02,896
need to opt into Dark Mode.

314
00:10:03,396 --> 0:10:05,346
Safari and WebKit will not auto

315
00:10:05,346 --> 0:10:06,556
darken your content.

316
00:10:07,356 --> 0:10:09,276
For simple email messages you

317
00:10:09,276 --> 0:10:10,196
don't have to worry.

318
00:10:10,606 --> 0:10:12,196
Mail darkens them to match the

319
00:10:12,196 --> 0:10:14,046
system appearance automatically

320
00:10:14,826 --> 0:10:16,066
and now you can use Web

321
00:10:16,066 --> 0:10:17,716
Inspector to test your content

322
00:10:17,716 --> 0:10:19,536
in light and Dark Modes with the

323
00:10:19,536 --> 0:10:21,016
new color scheme toggle in the

324
00:10:21,016 --> 0:10:21,876
elements tab.

325
00:10:22,096 --> 0:10:24,126
I look forward to seeing what

326
00:10:24,126 --> 0:10:25,496
you will do with this support

327
00:10:25,756 --> 0:10:27,476
and how your sites and apps will

328
00:10:27,476 --> 0:10:29,286
look in Dark Mode on Mac and

329
00:10:29,436 --> 0:10:29,946
iOS.
