[ Applause ]

3
00:00:13,786 --> 0:00:15,956
&gt;&gt; Hello. My name is Jessie

4
00:00:15,956 --> 0:00:17,436
Berlin, and I'm here to talk

5
00:00:17,436 --> 0:00:18,726
about what's new in Safari.

6
00:00:20,296 --> 0:00:21,476
We have three topics to cover

7
00:00:21,476 --> 0:00:24,556
today, and the most exciting one

8
00:00:24,766 --> 0:00:26,046
is desktop-class browsing on

9
00:00:27,136 --> 0:00:27,266
iPad.

10
00:00:28,356 --> 0:00:31,166
In iOS 13, we've made a set of

11
00:00:31,166 --> 0:00:33,166
fundamental changes to allow

12
00:00:33,166 --> 0:00:35,076
iPad to browse desktop websites,

13
00:00:35,766 --> 0:00:38,626
and you'll notice here that I'm

14
00:00:38,626 --> 0:00:39,826
showing Safari View Controller.

15
00:00:40,346 --> 0:00:41,636
It also gets these desktop

16
00:00:41,636 --> 0:00:43,066
websites right out of the box.

17
00:00:43,736 --> 0:00:46,466
If you have a custom in-app web

18
00:00:46,466 --> 0:00:48,636
browser, or even just an app

19
00:00:48,636 --> 0:00:50,186
that uses WKWebView, you're

20
00:00:50,186 --> 0:00:51,276
going to want to check out the

21
00:00:51,276 --> 0:00:53,006
talk from earlier this week for

22
00:00:53,006 --> 0:00:54,276
detailed guidance and best

23
00:00:54,276 --> 0:00:54,826
practices.

24
00:00:55,526 --> 0:00:57,946
So if you haven't already, go

25
00:00:57,946 --> 0:01:00,246
check it out.

26
00:00:57,946 --> 0:01:00,246
check it out.

27
00:01:00,516 --> 0:01:02,486
Next up, improvements to Safari

28
00:01:02,486 --> 0:01:03,006
extensions.

29
00:01:04,075 --> 0:01:05,385
We'll start with a refresher on

30
00:01:05,556 --> 0:01:06,736
the four different types of

31
00:01:06,736 --> 0:01:07,736
Safari extensions.

32
00:01:08,346 --> 0:01:12,766
First, there are Legacy Safari

33
00:01:12,766 --> 0:01:14,506
extensions from macOS.

34
00:01:15,566 --> 0:01:17,396
They were introduced in 2010

35
00:01:17,396 --> 0:01:19,326
with Mac OS X Snow Leopard, and

36
00:01:19,326 --> 0:01:21,896
deprecated last year.

37
00:01:22,096 --> 0:01:23,506
Next, content blockers.

38
00:01:24,256 --> 0:01:25,836
These are available for both iOS

39
00:01:25,836 --> 0:01:27,586
and macOS, and they're designed

40
00:01:27,586 --> 0:01:29,356
for speed and user privacy.

41
00:01:30,576 --> 0:01:32,456
Third, share extensions.

42
00:01:32,976 --> 0:01:34,146
These are also available on both

43
00:01:34,146 --> 0:01:35,076
iOS and macOS.

44
00:01:36,156 --> 0:01:37,336
Once invoked by the user,

45
00:01:37,696 --> 0:01:38,836
they're able to run JavaScript

46
00:01:38,836 --> 0:01:40,596
on the webpage, and return data

47
00:01:40,596 --> 0:01:41,756
to your app extension.

48
00:01:42,376 --> 0:01:45,166
And finally, Safari app

49
00:01:45,166 --> 0:01:46,976
extensions, available on macOS.

50
00:01:48,276 --> 0:01:49,786
These run on web pages without

51
00:01:49,936 --> 0:01:51,306
user action and can be

52
00:01:51,306 --> 0:01:52,466
restricted to run on a single

53
00:01:52,466 --> 0:01:53,866
website or run everywhere.

54
00:01:54,526 --> 0:01:58,156
Now that content blockers, share

55
00:01:58,156 --> 0:01:59,496
extensions, and Safari app

56
00:01:59,496 --> 0:02:01,136
extensions provide great

57
00:01:59,496 --> 0:02:01,136
extensions provide great

58
00:02:01,136 --> 0:02:02,686
extensibility options without

59
00:02:02,686 --> 0:02:05,086
the performance and privacy

60
00:02:05,086 --> 0:02:06,416
problems of Legacy Safari

61
00:02:06,416 --> 0:02:09,086
extensions, we are dropping

62
00:02:09,086 --> 0:02:10,346
support for Legacy Safari

63
00:02:10,346 --> 0:02:11,896
extensions in Safari 13.

64
00:02:12,456 --> 0:02:15,356
Safari will no longer load them.

65
00:02:16,196 --> 0:02:17,626
Today, we're going to be

66
00:02:17,626 --> 0:02:19,026
primarily focusing on

67
00:02:19,026 --> 0:02:20,596
improvements to content blockers

68
00:02:20,596 --> 0:02:21,706
and Safari app extensions on

69
00:02:21,706 --> 0:02:21,956
macOS.

70
00:02:24,916 --> 0:02:26,436
These Safari extensions come

71
00:02:26,436 --> 0:02:27,706
bundled with Mac apps built in

72
00:02:27,706 --> 0:02:29,386
Xcode, which gives you the

73
00:02:29,386 --> 0:02:30,836
ability to take advantage of

74
00:02:30,886 --> 0:02:32,316
powerful native APIs and

75
00:02:32,316 --> 0:02:34,236
frameworks, as well as HTML,

76
00:02:34,356 --> 0:02:37,886
JavaScript, and CSS.

77
00:02:38,396 --> 0:02:39,896
And when you install an app with

78
00:02:39,896 --> 0:02:41,126
a Safari app extension from the

79
00:02:41,126 --> 0:02:43,596
Mac App Store, your extensions

80
00:02:43,596 --> 0:02:44,896
show up immediately in Safari's

81
00:02:44,896 --> 0:02:46,266
preferences, ready for your

82
00:02:46,266 --> 0:02:48,946
users to turn on.

83
00:02:48,946 --> 0:02:50,716
However, you can also distribute

84
00:02:50,716 --> 0:02:52,086
your app directly from your

85
00:02:52,086 --> 0:02:53,306
website after running it through

86
00:02:53,306 --> 0:02:54,326
the notarization service.

87
00:02:55,536 --> 0:02:56,816
Notarized apps need to be

88
00:02:56,816 --> 0:02:58,556
launched at least once for their

89
00:02:58,556 --> 0:02:59,976
extension to show up in Safari.

90
00:03:00,616 --> 0:03:04,266
We love the content blockers and

91
00:03:04,266 --> 0:03:05,466
Safari app extensions you have

92
00:03:05,466 --> 0:03:07,566
created, and we also really

93
00:03:07,566 --> 0:03:09,126
appreciate those of you who have

94
00:03:09,126 --> 0:03:10,676
filed bug reports, suggested

95
00:03:10,676 --> 0:03:12,636
improvements, and commented on

96
00:03:12,636 --> 0:03:13,946
the Safari developer forums.

97
00:03:16,706 --> 0:03:17,876
And in response to that

98
00:03:17,876 --> 0:03:20,046
feedback, we've added new APIs

99
00:03:20,136 --> 0:03:21,366
for Safari app extensions to

100
00:03:21,366 --> 0:03:21,696
use.

101
00:03:24,156 --> 0:03:25,696
Earlier this year, we built out

102
00:03:25,696 --> 0:03:27,006
our windows and tabs APIs.

103
00:03:27,806 --> 0:03:29,066
Now you can navigate a tab

104
00:03:29,166 --> 0:03:30,656
directly from your app extension

105
00:03:30,656 --> 0:03:32,236
process to your full-page

106
00:03:32,236 --> 0:03:33,676
content, to provide extra

107
00:03:33,676 --> 0:03:35,136
functionality, like a dashboard.

108
00:03:35,776 --> 0:03:38,606
You can get all the open windows

109
00:03:38,606 --> 0:03:39,926
and tabs to provide things like

110
00:03:39,966 --> 0:03:43,226
bookmarking services, and get a

111
00:03:43,226 --> 0:03:44,826
reference to the containing tab

112
00:03:44,826 --> 0:03:46,016
and window when handling a

113
00:03:46,016 --> 0:03:47,166
message from your injected

114
00:03:47,166 --> 0:03:48,756
script to do things like

115
00:03:48,756 --> 0:03:52,466
updating your toolbar items.

116
00:03:52,666 --> 0:03:53,796
We've added a way for you to get

117
00:03:53,796 --> 0:03:55,176
the visible contents of a page.

118
00:03:55,876 --> 0:03:57,406
You could use this, for example,

119
00:03:57,406 --> 0:03:58,696
to show a custom visual

120
00:03:58,696 --> 0:04:00,346
representation of your user's

121
00:03:58,696 --> 0:04:00,346
representation of your user's

122
00:04:00,346 --> 0:04:00,706
tabs.

123
00:04:01,416 --> 0:04:04,426
And you now have more control

124
00:04:04,426 --> 0:04:06,646
over your UI in Safari, with the

125
00:04:06,646 --> 0:04:08,296
ability to programmatically show

126
00:04:08,296 --> 0:04:09,816
and dismiss your pop-overs when

127
00:04:09,816 --> 0:04:11,216
it makes the most sense for your

128
00:04:11,216 --> 0:04:11,856
use cases.

129
00:04:14,616 --> 0:04:15,896
You gave us feedback about

130
00:04:15,896 --> 0:04:16,935
wanting to know when a page will

131
00:04:16,935 --> 0:04:18,676
navigate, in order to redirect

132
00:04:18,676 --> 0:04:19,546
for a different version of the

133
00:04:19,546 --> 0:04:20,096
website.

134
00:04:21,136 --> 0:04:23,056
New in Safari 13, there's a

135
00:04:23,056 --> 0:04:24,446
callback that your app extension

136
00:04:24,446 --> 0:04:26,056
can handle to get notified of

137
00:04:26,056 --> 0:04:27,116
the full redirect chain.

138
00:04:27,666 --> 0:04:30,736
For those of you who developed

139
00:04:30,736 --> 0:04:32,386
content blockers, we heard that

140
00:04:32,386 --> 0:04:33,636
you really want a way to show

141
00:04:33,636 --> 0:04:35,566
off to your users just how much

142
00:04:35,566 --> 0:04:36,576
you're helping protect them

143
00:04:36,806 --> 0:04:38,456
against tracking, crypto

144
00:04:38,456 --> 0:04:40,096
currency mining, or other

145
00:04:40,096 --> 0:04:41,026
unnecessary scripts.

146
00:04:41,786 --> 0:04:44,636
So we're excited to announce, in

147
00:04:44,636 --> 0:04:46,426
Safari 13, that you can now

148
00:04:46,426 --> 0:04:47,756
associate your content blocker

149
00:04:47,756 --> 0:04:49,056
with your Safari app extension,

150
00:04:49,616 --> 0:04:51,896
so that it can get notified when

151
00:04:51,896 --> 0:04:52,666
content is blocked.

152
00:04:54,306 --> 0:04:55,646
Users will be able to just turn

153
00:04:55,646 --> 0:04:57,176
on the Safari app extension if

154
00:04:57,176 --> 0:04:58,576
they want to get statistics from

155
00:04:58,576 --> 0:05:00,566
you on what you've blocked or

156
00:04:58,576 --> 0:05:00,566
you on what you've blocked or

157
00:05:00,566 --> 0:05:01,606
keep it off if they want the

158
00:05:01,606 --> 0:05:02,896
most private experience.

159
00:05:03,616 --> 0:05:06,986
I've gone through these APIs

160
00:05:07,066 --> 0:05:08,896
pretty quickly here, but we've

161
00:05:08,896 --> 0:05:10,076
created a video that you can

162
00:05:10,076 --> 0:05:11,756
watch to learn more in-depth how

163
00:05:11,756 --> 0:05:12,386
to adopt them.

164
00:05:13,826 --> 0:05:16,246
Check it out in the WWDC app.

165
00:05:17,956 --> 0:05:19,746
The last time you checked out

166
00:05:19,746 --> 0:05:21,566
Safari app extensions might've

167
00:05:21,566 --> 0:05:23,186
been in 2016, when we first

168
00:05:23,186 --> 0:05:23,846
introduced them.

169
00:05:24,996 --> 0:05:25,946
As you can see from what we

170
00:05:25,946 --> 0:05:28,006
covered today, we've added a lot

171
00:05:28,006 --> 0:05:29,636
of functionality and APIs since

172
00:05:29,686 --> 0:05:29,916
then.

173
00:05:30,876 --> 0:05:32,046
If you haven't converted your

174
00:05:32,046 --> 0:05:33,466
Legacy Safari extension yet,

175
00:05:34,046 --> 0:05:35,456
head on over to our guide on

176
00:05:35,456 --> 0:05:36,786
developer.apple.com.

177
00:05:37,376 --> 0:05:40,666
And that's improvements to

178
00:05:40,666 --> 0:05:41,586
Safari extensions.

179
00:05:44,336 --> 0:05:45,726
Lastly, I want to talk about

180
00:05:45,726 --> 0:05:47,146
following links on macOS.

181
00:05:47,336 --> 0:05:50,396
I'm of course talking about

182
00:05:50,396 --> 0:05:52,216
following links like these to

183
00:05:52,216 --> 0:05:54,956
websites and apps.

184
00:05:55,076 --> 0:05:56,176
For those of you bringing your

185
00:05:56,176 --> 0:05:58,216
iPad apps to the Mac, you might

186
00:05:58,216 --> 0:05:59,676
be wondering how this is going

187
00:05:59,676 --> 0:06:00,076
to work.

188
00:05:59,676 --> 0:06:00,076
to work.

189
00:06:01,006 --> 0:06:02,646
In-app web browsing isn't common

190
00:06:02,646 --> 0:06:04,386
on macOS, but it is on iOS.

191
00:06:05,146 --> 0:06:07,736
And on iOS, you're probably

192
00:06:07,736 --> 0:06:09,276
using SafariViewController for

193
00:06:09,376 --> 0:06:10,976
the best in-app web browsing

194
00:06:10,976 --> 0:06:11,536
experience.

195
00:06:12,996 --> 0:06:14,006
When you open a link in

196
00:06:14,006 --> 0:06:15,446
SafariViewController in your Mac

197
00:06:15,446 --> 0:06:17,396
app, it does exactly what your

198
00:06:17,796 --> 0:06:19,006
macOS users will expect.

199
00:06:19,646 --> 0:06:21,196
It opens the link directly in

200
00:06:21,196 --> 0:06:22,666
their browser, and immediately

201
00:06:22,666 --> 0:06:24,376
calls SafariViewController did

202
00:06:24,376 --> 0:06:25,366
finish to notify you.

203
00:06:26,006 --> 0:06:28,676
For those of you who have

204
00:06:28,676 --> 0:06:30,256
implemented custom in-app web

205
00:06:30,256 --> 0:06:32,166
browser on iOS, you should

206
00:06:32,166 --> 0:06:34,196
strongly instead consider

207
00:06:34,196 --> 0:06:35,826
directly opening links on Mac,

208
00:06:36,406 --> 0:06:37,526
so that they open in the user's

209
00:06:37,526 --> 0:06:38,096
web browser.

210
00:06:38,576 --> 0:06:39,706
That's what your macOS users

211
00:06:39,706 --> 0:06:43,576
will be expecting.

212
00:06:43,576 --> 0:06:44,576
We're also excited that

213
00:06:44,576 --> 0:06:45,736
universal links are coming to

214
00:06:45,736 --> 0:06:46,576
macOS this year.

215
00:06:47,956 --> 0:06:49,916
On iOS and macOS, universal

216
00:06:49,916 --> 0:06:52,696
links allow you to have ordinary

217
00:06:52,736 --> 0:06:54,816
HTTPS URLs to your website open

218
00:06:54,816 --> 0:06:55,906
in your app instead, if it's

219
00:06:55,906 --> 0:06:56,386
installed.

220
00:06:56,996 --> 0:06:59,646
It's way better than custom URL

221
00:06:59,696 --> 0:07:01,386
schemes, which just don't work

222
00:06:59,696 --> 0:07:01,386
schemes, which just don't work

223
00:07:01,556 --> 0:07:04,986
if your app isn't installed.

224
00:07:05,056 --> 0:07:06,736
Universal links on Mac initially

225
00:07:06,736 --> 0:07:08,146
open in your web browser, just

226
00:07:08,146 --> 0:07:10,346
like before, and when they open

227
00:07:10,346 --> 0:07:11,676
in Safari and your app is

228
00:07:11,676 --> 0:07:13,316
installed, Safari will show a

229
00:07:13,316 --> 0:07:14,666
banner at the top of the

230
00:07:14,666 --> 0:07:15,196
webpage.

231
00:07:16,196 --> 0:07:18,366
There, the user can choose to

232
00:07:18,366 --> 0:07:19,696
open the link in your app, and

233
00:07:20,496 --> 0:07:22,646
if they do, future link follows

234
00:07:22,646 --> 0:07:23,876
will be open directly in your

235
00:07:23,876 --> 0:07:23,976
app.

236
00:07:26,736 --> 0:07:28,356
To learn more about universal

237
00:07:28,356 --> 0:07:29,996
links, check out the video we

238
00:07:29,996 --> 0:07:31,916
made, available right now in the

239
00:07:31,916 --> 0:07:33,546
WWDC app.

240
00:07:35,106 --> 0:07:36,516
And that's following links on

241
00:07:36,516 --> 0:07:36,936
macOS.

242
00:07:37,666 --> 0:07:40,746
There have been a bunch of great

243
00:07:40,746 --> 0:07:42,596
improvements in the intersection

244
00:07:42,596 --> 0:07:44,226
of app development and web

245
00:07:44,226 --> 0:07:45,106
technologies this year.

246
00:07:45,726 --> 0:07:48,796
One last point I want to leave

247
00:07:48,796 --> 0:07:49,106
you with.

248
00:07:50,016 --> 0:07:51,806
We're committed to making Safari

249
00:07:51,806 --> 0:07:53,076
app extensions and content

250
00:07:53,076 --> 0:07:54,186
blockers better each year.

251
00:07:54,326 --> 0:07:56,226
If you had previously checked

252
00:07:56,226 --> 0:07:57,516
them out but found that a

253
00:07:57,516 --> 0:07:59,706
particular API or capability was

254
00:07:59,706 --> 0:08:01,636
missing, it's worth taking

255
00:07:59,706 --> 0:08:01,636
missing, it's worth taking

256
00:08:01,636 --> 0:08:03,046
another look and converting your

257
00:08:03,046 --> 0:08:04,306
Legacy Safari extension.

258
00:08:04,916 --> 0:08:08,046
To find out more about what we

259
00:08:08,046 --> 0:08:10,046
covered today, check out the

260
00:08:10,046 --> 0:08:11,426
WWDC app, where there'll be

261
00:08:11,426 --> 0:08:12,686
links to resources we talked

262
00:08:12,686 --> 0:08:14,586
about and further documentation.

263
00:08:15,836 --> 0:08:16,906
And if you have any questions

264
00:08:16,906 --> 0:08:18,796
right now, we'll be headed over

265
00:08:18,796 --> 0:08:19,886
to Technology Lab 3.

266
00:08:20,286 --> 0:08:21,196
We'd love to see you there.

267
00:08:22,986 --> 0:08:24,186
Thank you so much and have a

268
00:08:24,186 --> 0:08:24,966
great WWDC.
