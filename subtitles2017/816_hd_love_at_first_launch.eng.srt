1
00:00:22,066 --> 00:00:23,166
&gt;&gt; Imagine you're searching for

2
00:00:23,166 --> 00:00:23,826
an apartment.

3
00:00:24,366 --> 00:00:25,896
You've been on the hunt and this

4
00:00:25,896 --> 00:00:26,706
one looks pretty good.

5
00:00:27,476 --> 00:00:28,366
The price is right.

6
00:00:28,976 --> 00:00:30,796
The photos show tons of natural

7
00:00:30,796 --> 00:00:30,966
light.

8
00:00:30,966 --> 00:00:31,946
It's close to work.

9
00:00:32,476 --> 00:00:34,236
So you schedule some time to

10
00:00:34,236 --> 00:00:36,096
stop by and check the place out.

11
00:00:37,096 --> 00:00:37,856
You bike over.

12
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:39,046
Someone buzzes you in.

13
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:40,136
You find the apartment door.

14
00:00:40,826 --> 00:00:43,736
You give it a knock and the

15
00:00:43,736 --> 00:00:44,886
landlord greets you.

16
00:00:45,736 --> 00:00:47,066
And before he'll even let you

17
00:00:47,066 --> 00:00:48,996
pass the front door, he has some

18
00:00:48,996 --> 00:00:49,736
requirements.

19
00:00:50,266 --> 00:00:51,816
He wants to see a passport, a

20
00:00:51,816 --> 00:00:53,546
birth certificate, and your last

21
00:00:53,546 --> 00:00:54,486
four paystubs.

22
00:00:54,906 --> 00:00:55,706
Now this would be a little

23
00:00:55,706 --> 00:00:56,466
ridiculous, right?

24
00:00:57,156 --> 00:00:58,186
You just want to check the place

25
00:00:58,186 --> 00:00:58,406
out.

26
00:00:58,406 --> 00:00:59,416
You're not ready to commit to

27
00:00:59,416 --> 00:01:01,416
anything yet plus who knows if

28
00:00:59,416 --> 00:01:01,416
anything yet plus who knows if

29
00:01:01,416 --> 00:01:03,216
you're private info's safe with

30
00:01:03,216 --> 00:01:03,596
this guy?

31
00:01:05,986 --> 00:01:07,156
First impressions matter.

32
00:01:08,136 --> 00:01:09,466
They matter because they could

33
00:01:09,466 --> 00:01:10,346
also be your last.

34
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:12,416
People have access to millions

35
00:01:12,416 --> 00:01:13,466
of apps in the App Store.

36
00:01:14,216 --> 00:01:15,426
You've already passed the first

37
00:01:15,426 --> 00:01:16,756
hurdle when someone installs

38
00:01:16,756 --> 00:01:17,116
your app.

39
00:01:17,546 --> 00:01:21,406
Great. So prevent them from

40
00:01:21,406 --> 00:01:22,706
backing out and deleting your

41
00:01:22,706 --> 00:01:24,066
app in the same way you'd

42
00:01:24,066 --> 00:01:25,176
probably be off to the next

43
00:01:25,176 --> 00:01:26,036
apartment on your list.

44
00:01:26,156 --> 00:01:27,706
And then instead, start things

45
00:01:27,706 --> 00:01:28,866
off with a great first

46
00:01:28,866 --> 00:01:29,336
impression.

47
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:34,236
Now suppose you're planning a

48
00:01:34,236 --> 00:01:36,036
trip and a friend suggested this

49
00:01:36,236 --> 00:01:37,086
travel app here.

50
00:01:38,076 --> 00:01:39,226
Looks pretty good.

51
00:01:39,726 --> 00:01:41,226
So the installation completes.

52
00:01:41,366 --> 00:01:43,006
You tap open for the first time

53
00:01:44,066 --> 00:01:45,426
and you're met with this.

54
00:01:46,526 --> 00:01:48,026
Now does this look familiar?

55
00:01:48,856 --> 00:01:50,216
Someone wants you to register

56
00:01:50,216 --> 00:01:51,506
here but there's not much info

57
00:01:51,506 --> 00:01:53,086
about what this app actually

58
00:01:53,086 --> 00:01:53,506
does.

59
00:01:54,336 --> 00:01:55,716
And sure you have some idea

60
00:01:55,816 --> 00:01:56,436
after your friend's

61
00:01:56,436 --> 00:01:58,506
recommendation but when you open

62
00:01:58,506 --> 00:02:00,396
the app for the first time and

63
00:01:58,506 --> 00:02:00,396
the app for the first time and

64
00:02:00,486 --> 00:02:02,256
this is how you're greeted, it

65
00:02:02,256 --> 00:02:03,506
still feels a little something

66
00:02:03,506 --> 00:02:04,686
like this guy.

67
00:02:07,296 --> 00:02:08,786
There's a chance you might back

68
00:02:08,786 --> 00:02:10,235
out, delete it, and go find

69
00:02:10,235 --> 00:02:10,816
something else.

70
00:02:12,926 --> 00:02:15,876
Now consider this military base

71
00:02:16,376 --> 00:02:18,006
with its fortified exterior.

72
00:02:18,356 --> 00:02:19,336
The message to anyone on the

73
00:02:19,336 --> 00:02:20,256
outside is clear.

74
00:02:20,256 --> 00:02:21,196
Stay out. Right?

75
00:02:22,576 --> 00:02:23,716
Compare that to Apple Union

76
00:02:23,716 --> 00:02:25,096
Square in San Francisco.

77
00:02:25,736 --> 00:02:26,846
The entire front of the store

78
00:02:26,846 --> 00:02:28,926
opens up to the sidewalk invited

79
00:02:28,926 --> 00:02:30,246
passersby to wonder in.

80
00:02:31,086 --> 00:02:32,426
And wondering is exactly what

81
00:02:32,426 --> 00:02:34,856
they do because people use -- as

82
00:02:34,856 --> 00:02:36,056
people explore the store,

83
00:02:36,056 --> 00:02:37,186
they're able to pick up and use

84
00:02:37,356 --> 00:02:37,806
iPhones.

85
00:02:38,346 --> 00:02:39,336
They might not take a new Mac

86
00:02:39,336 --> 00:02:40,816
for a test drive or try on an

87
00:02:40,816 --> 00:02:41,476
Apple Watch.

88
00:02:41,976 --> 00:02:43,206
All without obstacles or

89
00:02:43,206 --> 00:02:43,716
friction.

90
00:02:44,396 --> 00:02:46,556
Your first launch experience

91
00:02:46,556 --> 00:02:47,306
should feel just as

92
00:02:47,306 --> 00:02:47,946
frictionless.

93
00:02:48,596 --> 00:02:49,686
If people are greeted with an

94
00:02:49,756 --> 00:02:51,466
open, interactive experience,

95
00:02:51,816 --> 00:02:53,006
the very first time they tap

96
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,626
your icon, you're going to make

97
00:02:54,626 --> 00:02:55,946
a great first impression and

98
00:02:55,946 --> 00:02:56,676
keep them coming back.

99
00:02:57,516 --> 00:02:58,626
So let's talk about some ways to

100
00:02:58,626 --> 00:02:59,226
make that happen.

101
00:03:01,176 --> 00:03:02,936
We'll be discussing some tips

102
00:03:02,936 --> 00:03:04,566
for leading with content first.

103
00:03:05,946 --> 00:03:07,296
How to teach new users about

104
00:03:07,296 --> 00:03:08,706
your app through interaction.

105
00:03:10,096 --> 00:03:11,576
And when you need to ask for

106
00:03:11,576 --> 00:03:12,816
some more information upfront,

107
00:03:13,076 --> 00:03:16,096
some tips on timing that will

108
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,546
add to a great user experience.

109
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:19,796
So let's start with some

110
00:03:19,796 --> 00:03:21,226
strategies with a content first

111
00:03:21,226 --> 00:03:21,656
approach.

112
00:03:22,716 --> 00:03:25,396
Let's compare our travel app to

113
00:03:26,066 --> 00:03:27,356
another travel app.

114
00:03:27,956 --> 00:03:29,296
Now this is Jetsetter.

115
00:03:29,336 --> 00:03:31,366
And the very first time you open

116
00:03:31,366 --> 00:03:32,626
Jetsetter you're immediately

117
00:03:32,626 --> 00:03:34,336
greeted with this great content.

118
00:03:35,036 --> 00:03:36,396
Big beautiful images.

119
00:03:36,506 --> 00:03:37,576
Useful information.

120
00:03:38,286 --> 00:03:39,506
You can browse this feed, of

121
00:03:39,506 --> 00:03:40,596
course, or you can jump right

122
00:03:40,596 --> 00:03:41,456
into search if you have

123
00:03:41,456 --> 00:03:42,586
something specific in mind.

124
00:03:43,836 --> 00:03:45,016
If a destination catches your

125
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:46,446
attention, you can drill in for

126
00:03:46,446 --> 00:03:48,206
more photos and more details.

127
00:03:50,806 --> 00:03:52,296
And it's been seconds since you

128
00:03:52,296 --> 00:03:53,226
first launched this app and

129
00:03:53,226 --> 00:03:54,226
you're already using it like a

130
00:03:54,226 --> 00:03:54,536
pro.

131
00:03:55,386 --> 00:03:56,236
You're intrigued by all this

132
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:57,866
great content and you've already

133
00:03:57,866 --> 00:03:59,116
started daydreaming about laying

134
00:03:59,116 --> 00:03:59,876
on this beach.

135
00:04:00,946 --> 00:04:01,776
It's only when you're ready to

136
00:04:01,776 --> 00:04:03,516
book the trip that you're

137
00:04:03,516 --> 00:04:04,566
prompted to register.

138
00:04:05,566 --> 00:04:06,846
By now, you've got a good idea

139
00:04:06,846 --> 00:04:08,146
of what the app has to offer.

140
00:04:08,546 --> 00:04:09,356
You've seen the potential

141
00:04:09,356 --> 00:04:10,556
benefits of registering.

142
00:04:10,986 --> 00:04:12,106
So this feels like a more

143
00:04:12,106 --> 00:04:13,486
appropriate time to share more

144
00:04:13,486 --> 00:04:13,976
details.

145
00:04:17,046 --> 00:04:18,245
If you're not convinced yet,

146
00:04:18,696 --> 00:04:20,596
just compare Jetsetter with our

147
00:04:20,596 --> 00:04:21,666
other travel app.

148
00:04:22,986 --> 00:04:24,096
Now we've all been through some

149
00:04:24,096 --> 00:04:25,266
version of that top row.

150
00:04:25,456 --> 00:04:26,536
Which one of these feels more

151
00:04:26,536 --> 00:04:27,336
welcoming to you?

152
00:04:31,326 --> 00:04:32,846
Always lead with great content.

153
00:04:33,486 --> 00:04:34,526
Show off what makes your app

154
00:04:34,526 --> 00:04:36,536
great right off the bat and let

155
00:04:36,536 --> 00:04:37,196
people dig in.

156
00:04:39,366 --> 00:04:41,156
Now there are some situations

157
00:04:41,196 --> 00:04:42,226
where a little bit of upfront

158
00:04:42,226 --> 00:04:43,656
instruction might be helpful.

159
00:04:44,516 --> 00:04:46,556
And I say might because before

160
00:04:46,556 --> 00:04:47,576
you start incorporating some of

161
00:04:47,576 --> 00:04:48,716
the tips we're about to look at,

162
00:04:49,116 --> 00:04:50,256
I want you to very carefully

163
00:04:50,256 --> 00:04:51,646
consider whether any upfront

164
00:04:51,646 --> 00:04:52,816
instruction is needed at all.

165
00:04:53,686 --> 00:04:55,056
Let's take a quick look at the

166
00:04:55,056 --> 00:04:55,516
phone app.

167
00:04:56,616 --> 00:04:58,956
Now just imagine if we designed

168
00:04:58,956 --> 00:05:00,406
this with a series of first run

169
00:04:58,956 --> 00:05:00,406
this with a series of first run

170
00:05:00,406 --> 00:05:01,006
tool tips.

171
00:05:02,056 --> 00:05:03,936
It'll be a little ridiculous,

172
00:05:03,936 --> 00:05:04,146
right?

173
00:05:05,726 --> 00:05:07,026
This interface is obvious.

174
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:08,436
We know how it works.

175
00:05:09,706 --> 00:05:10,776
You should strive to design your

176
00:05:10,776 --> 00:05:12,256
interfaces to be as intuitive

177
00:05:12,366 --> 00:05:13,776
and as easy to understand as

178
00:05:13,776 --> 00:05:14,286
possible.

179
00:05:14,796 --> 00:05:16,576
Ideally no upfront instruction

180
00:05:16,576 --> 00:05:17,256
is needed at all.

181
00:05:17,256 --> 00:05:17,556
All right.

182
00:05:18,506 --> 00:05:21,336
Let's take a look at Lara Croft

183
00:05:21,336 --> 00:05:21,866
GO.

184
00:05:22,806 --> 00:05:24,016
This is your starting point

185
00:05:24,016 --> 00:05:24,226
here.

186
00:05:24,756 --> 00:05:25,586
No onboarding.

187
00:05:25,586 --> 00:05:26,706
No instructions.

188
00:05:27,406 --> 00:05:28,626
Nothing to pull your attention

189
00:05:28,626 --> 00:05:30,226
from this immersive experience.

190
00:05:30,346 --> 00:05:32,826
You're right in the game but you

191
00:05:32,826 --> 00:05:33,706
still need to learn how to play

192
00:05:33,706 --> 00:05:34,216
this game.

193
00:05:34,446 --> 00:05:35,766
So these first two levels are

194
00:05:35,766 --> 00:05:36,866
designed to introduce you to the

195
00:05:36,866 --> 00:05:37,436
basics.

196
00:05:39,146 --> 00:05:40,496
Well, you only have a straight

197
00:05:40,496 --> 00:05:42,336
line here and Lara looks like

198
00:05:42,336 --> 00:05:43,096
she's ready to go.

199
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:44,886
Since there are no visible

200
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:46,686
controls, you try swiping on the

201
00:05:46,686 --> 00:05:47,146
screen.

202
00:05:47,726 --> 00:05:49,526
And sure enough, she starts

203
00:05:49,526 --> 00:05:50,536
moving in the direction you've

204
00:05:50,536 --> 00:05:50,976
gestured.

205
00:05:54,186 --> 00:05:55,266
You quickly discover you can

206
00:05:55,266 --> 00:05:56,416
move up and down walls too.

207
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:58,766
And congratulations, you've

208
00:05:58,766 --> 00:06:00,106
learned the game's navigation

209
00:05:58,766 --> 00:06:00,106
learned the game's navigation

210
00:06:00,106 --> 00:06:00,696
controls.

211
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:03,436
All right.

212
00:06:03,466 --> 00:06:04,566
Now you've got this glowing tile

213
00:06:04,566 --> 00:06:05,286
up ahead catching your

214
00:06:05,286 --> 00:06:05,726
attention.

215
00:06:06,336 --> 00:06:08,166
Options look pretty limited so

216
00:06:08,746 --> 00:06:13,106
let's go check it out.

217
00:06:13,626 --> 00:06:15,636
Yes, you've just completed a

218
00:06:15,636 --> 00:06:16,086
level.

219
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:21,206
Now that one was pretty simple,

220
00:06:21,206 --> 00:06:26,526
of course, but it's teaching you

221
00:06:26,526 --> 00:06:28,486
the basics and you're already

222
00:06:28,586 --> 00:06:29,266
playing the game.

223
00:06:30,876 --> 00:06:32,546
All right.

224
00:06:32,546 --> 00:06:33,486
Level 2 starts here.

225
00:06:33,626 --> 00:06:35,356
It looks like your path is cut

226
00:06:35,356 --> 00:06:35,656
short.

227
00:06:35,756 --> 00:06:36,976
So let's try that switch.

228
00:06:43,216 --> 00:06:45,466
Ah ha, the missing path fills in

229
00:06:45,926 --> 00:06:47,136
and you've figured out another

230
00:06:47,136 --> 00:06:48,436
important part about how this

231
00:06:48,436 --> 00:06:49,056
game works.

232
00:06:49,206 --> 00:06:53,276
You know, of course, things get

233
00:06:53,276 --> 00:06:54,486
a lot more complex from here.

234
00:06:55,006 --> 00:06:56,106
But you can start to see how

235
00:06:56,106 --> 00:06:57,816
instruction can be layered into

236
00:06:57,816 --> 00:06:58,656
an experience.

237
00:06:59,226 --> 00:07:00,456
And again, no onboarding.

238
00:06:59,226 --> 00:07:00,456
And again, no onboarding.

239
00:07:00,456 --> 00:07:02,366
No tool tips or floating hands

240
00:07:02,366 --> 00:07:02,576
here.

241
00:07:02,716 --> 00:07:04,186
There are no barriers when you

242
00:07:04,186 --> 00:07:05,526
first play Lara Croft GO.

243
00:07:06,356 --> 00:07:07,666
This approach works in all kinds

244
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:08,786
of apps not just games.

245
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:12,006
This is Streaks.

246
00:07:12,366 --> 00:07:13,706
It's a simple app designed to

247
00:07:13,706 --> 00:07:14,906
help you pick up new habits.

248
00:07:15,506 --> 00:07:17,226
In my case as you might be able

249
00:07:17,226 --> 00:07:18,976
to guess I'm studying French and

250
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:20,146
I'm trying to make a habit of

251
00:07:20,146 --> 00:07:20,976
practicing every day.

252
00:07:21,456 --> 00:07:22,336
Maybe Streaks can help.

253
00:07:23,446 --> 00:07:25,186
The completion of a task is

254
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:26,576
represented by the filling in of

255
00:07:26,576 --> 00:07:26,946
a ring.

256
00:07:27,876 --> 00:07:29,526
So the first launch experience

257
00:07:29,526 --> 00:07:31,236
conveys this in a clever way by

258
00:07:31,236 --> 00:07:32,586
inviting you to fill in rings as

259
00:07:32,586 --> 00:07:33,426
you proceed through this

260
00:07:33,426 --> 00:07:33,956
introduction.

261
00:07:35,786 --> 00:07:37,026
And you're led right into

262
00:07:37,026 --> 00:07:39,186
creating your first habit.

263
00:07:39,956 --> 00:07:41,726
So if your app requires a bit of

264
00:07:41,726 --> 00:07:43,376
upfront education, it's going to

265
00:07:43,376 --> 00:07:44,606
be a lot more compelling if it's

266
00:07:44,636 --> 00:07:46,446
interactive and gives people

267
00:07:46,446 --> 00:07:47,746
that sense of jumping right in.

268
00:07:51,216 --> 00:07:52,396
Teach through interactive

269
00:07:52,396 --> 00:07:53,236
experiences.

270
00:07:53,866 --> 00:07:57,186
Now another place you don't want

271
00:07:57,186 --> 00:07:58,206
people to get stuck is with

272
00:07:58,296 --> 00:07:59,286
permission requests.

273
00:07:59,886 --> 00:08:00,996
And you know what it's like to

274
00:07:59,886 --> 00:08:00,996
And you know what it's like to

275
00:08:00,996 --> 00:08:02,166
open an app for the first time

276
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:03,066
and get hit with permission

277
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:03,976
request after permission

278
00:08:03,976 --> 00:08:04,486
request.

279
00:08:04,906 --> 00:08:05,966
Sort of like that demanding

280
00:08:05,966 --> 00:08:06,996
landlord we met earlier.

281
00:08:07,196 --> 00:08:08,576
So let's look at some tips for

282
00:08:08,576 --> 00:08:09,186
getting this right.

283
00:08:10,216 --> 00:08:12,476
This is Strava.

284
00:08:13,856 --> 00:08:15,356
Strava lets you use your iPhone

285
00:08:15,396 --> 00:08:17,056
to track outdoor runs and bike

286
00:08:17,086 --> 00:08:17,526
rides.

287
00:08:18,176 --> 00:08:19,786
And it eventually asks for

288
00:08:19,786 --> 00:08:21,486
access to your location, your

289
00:08:21,486 --> 00:08:23,486
camera, your context, even

290
00:08:23,486 --> 00:08:25,656
HealthKit data but it doesn't

291
00:08:25,656 --> 00:08:26,896
ask for all of these right away.

292
00:08:27,816 --> 00:08:29,346
Instead, Strava makes requests

293
00:08:29,346 --> 00:08:30,696
on an as needed basis.

294
00:08:32,556 --> 00:08:33,946
For example, it's not until

295
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:35,015
you're ready to take Strava out

296
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:36,256
for a ride for the first time

297
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:37,726
that you're prompted to share

298
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:38,356
your location.

299
00:08:39,265 --> 00:08:40,946
So you hit record down on the

300
00:08:40,946 --> 00:08:41,586
bottom.

301
00:08:41,586 --> 00:08:42,645
We'll get you on a ride here.

302
00:08:43,645 --> 00:08:44,416
Who's ready to roll?

303
00:08:45,466 --> 00:08:48,696
All right.

304
00:08:48,696 --> 00:08:50,516
So you get on ride and

305
00:08:50,516 --> 00:08:52,026
eventually a little while later,

306
00:08:52,176 --> 00:08:53,506
you're ready to wrap things up.

307
00:08:53,646 --> 00:08:54,796
We'll make it a short ride.

308
00:08:56,316 --> 00:08:58,246
So you stop the ride and you tap

309
00:08:58,246 --> 00:08:58,646
save.

310
00:08:59,896 --> 00:09:01,256
Now when you're saving a ride,

311
00:08:59,896 --> 00:09:01,256
Now when you're saving a ride,

312
00:09:01,586 --> 00:09:02,646
you have the option to add more

313
00:09:02,646 --> 00:09:04,976
details including a photo.

314
00:09:08,796 --> 00:09:10,016
And it's only when you tap add a

315
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:11,706
photo that you're prompted for

316
00:09:11,706 --> 00:09:12,946
access to your photo library.

317
00:09:12,946 --> 00:09:15,716
And this is another great

318
00:09:15,716 --> 00:09:17,556
example of a permission request

319
00:09:17,606 --> 00:09:18,926
that's right in context.

320
00:09:19,376 --> 00:09:20,446
So you immediately see the

321
00:09:20,446 --> 00:09:21,966
benefit and no additional

322
00:09:21,966 --> 00:09:23,176
explanation is necessary.

323
00:09:25,426 --> 00:09:26,876
And it's the same situation when

324
00:09:26,876 --> 00:09:28,376
looking for friends on Strava in

325
00:09:28,376 --> 00:09:29,136
your contacts.

326
00:09:31,176 --> 00:09:32,886
The app requests permissions on

327
00:09:32,886 --> 00:09:33,966
a need to know basis.

328
00:09:34,566 --> 00:09:36,046
So you retain a sense of control

329
00:09:36,046 --> 00:09:37,866
over both the experience and

330
00:09:37,866 --> 00:09:39,496
your private data.

331
00:09:42,036 --> 00:09:43,656
Now there are a few apps out

332
00:09:43,656 --> 00:09:45,266
there that can't offer any value

333
00:09:45,266 --> 00:09:46,186
without some sort of

334
00:09:46,186 --> 00:09:46,776
permissions.

335
00:09:47,506 --> 00:09:48,576
This is Transit.

336
00:09:49,076 --> 00:09:50,546
It lists departures of nearby

337
00:09:50,546 --> 00:09:52,366
buses and trains ordered based

338
00:09:52,366 --> 00:09:53,486
on proximity to your current

339
00:09:53,486 --> 00:09:53,976
location.

340
00:09:54,306 --> 00:09:56,116
I live in San Francisco and I

341
00:09:56,116 --> 00:09:57,546
use this one all the time to get

342
00:09:57,546 --> 00:09:57,866
around.

343
00:09:59,816 --> 00:10:00,986
Of course it wouldn't be able to

344
00:09:59,816 --> 00:10:00,986
Of course it wouldn't be able to

345
00:10:00,986 --> 00:10:02,596
provide this data without your

346
00:10:02,596 --> 00:10:03,236
location.

347
00:10:03,856 --> 00:10:05,226
So the first time you launch the

348
00:10:05,226 --> 00:10:07,326
app, you are prompted to share

349
00:10:07,326 --> 00:10:08,016
your location.

350
00:10:08,876 --> 00:10:10,706
And as soon as you tap allow,

351
00:10:10,706 --> 00:10:12,376
the map zooms in and you're

352
00:10:12,376 --> 00:10:13,786
presented with a list of nearby

353
00:10:13,786 --> 00:10:15,086
routes and departure times.

354
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:17,446
So you immediately see the value

355
00:10:17,446 --> 00:10:19,146
Transit will provide in exchange

356
00:10:19,146 --> 00:10:20,176
for this information.

357
00:10:21,866 --> 00:10:26,496
So remember, ensure people

358
00:10:26,496 --> 00:10:28,226
understand the value of sharing

359
00:10:28,226 --> 00:10:29,296
their private data with you

360
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:31,436
ideally before you ask for it.

361
00:10:32,496 --> 00:10:33,476
Once that permission has been

362
00:10:33,476 --> 00:10:35,606
granted, reinforce the decision

363
00:10:35,606 --> 00:10:36,976
by showing off the benefits

364
00:10:36,976 --> 00:10:38,486
you'll provide with that data.

365
00:10:39,206 --> 00:10:40,686
Only ask for what's needed when

366
00:10:40,686 --> 00:10:41,146
it's needed.

367
00:10:43,516 --> 00:10:45,206
Follow these tips and I promise

368
00:10:45,206 --> 00:10:45,956
you'll make a great first

369
00:10:45,956 --> 00:10:46,426
impression.

370
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:47,206
Thank you.
