[ Applause ]

2
00:00:23,456 --> 00:00:24,746
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon, and welcome

3
00:00:24,746 --> 00:00:26,676
everybody to our session, Best

4
00:00:26,676 --> 00:00:28,566
Practices and What's New in User

5
00:00:28,566 --> 00:00:29,326
Notifications.

6
00:00:30,006 --> 00:00:31,616
I'm Kritharth Jain and a junior

7
00:00:31,706 --> 00:00:33,316
on the iOS notifications team

8
00:00:33,796 --> 00:00:34,616
and I'll be joined by my

9
00:00:34,616 --> 00:00:35,756
colleague, Teja, for this

10
00:00:35,756 --> 00:00:36,306
session today.

11
00:00:37,476 --> 00:00:39,746
So, today we're going to start

12
00:00:39,916 --> 00:00:41,206
by doing an overview of

13
00:00:41,246 --> 00:00:42,896
notifications and all the

14
00:00:42,896 --> 00:00:44,756
different APIs that you as app

15
00:00:44,756 --> 00:00:46,106
developers can use for doing

16
00:00:46,106 --> 00:00:47,536
notifications for your

17
00:00:47,536 --> 00:00:48,206
applications.

18
00:00:49,176 --> 00:00:50,676
Then, we're going to jump into

19
00:00:50,676 --> 00:00:52,286
four different use cases for

20
00:00:52,286 --> 00:00:53,076
notifications.

21
00:00:53,856 --> 00:00:54,886
We're going to start out by

22
00:00:54,886 --> 00:00:56,796
introducing a new concept for

23
00:00:56,796 --> 00:00:58,856
iOS notifications about hidden

24
00:00:58,856 --> 00:01:00,926
notification content which we

25
00:00:58,856 --> 00:01:00,926
notification content which we

26
00:01:00,926 --> 00:01:01,746
think you're going to be really

27
00:01:01,746 --> 00:01:02,406
excited about.

28
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:04,656
Then we're going to jump into

29
00:01:04,656 --> 00:01:05,926
our second use case about

30
00:01:05,966 --> 00:01:07,686
modifying push notification

31
00:01:07,686 --> 00:01:09,286
content before delivery to the

32
00:01:09,286 --> 00:01:09,626
user.

33
00:01:10,536 --> 00:01:11,456
Then we'll talk about

34
00:01:11,456 --> 00:01:13,286
customizing rich notifications

35
00:01:13,556 --> 00:01:15,056
and how you can completely own

36
00:01:15,306 --> 00:01:17,016
the UI and feel of these

37
00:01:17,016 --> 00:01:17,796
notifications.

38
00:01:18,406 --> 00:01:20,436
And lastly we'll talk about user

39
00:01:20,436 --> 00:01:22,386
input customization associated

40
00:01:22,606 --> 00:01:23,896
with these rich notifications.

41
00:01:25,216 --> 00:01:26,786
So, let's start with the

42
00:01:26,786 --> 00:01:27,906
notifications overview.

43
00:01:28,936 --> 00:01:30,426
Now, I'm sure you all know that

44
00:01:30,426 --> 00:01:31,236
there are two types of

45
00:01:31,236 --> 00:01:31,926
notifications.

46
00:01:32,296 --> 00:01:33,506
There are local notifications.

47
00:01:33,926 --> 00:01:35,306
These are the ones that are

48
00:01:35,306 --> 00:01:37,346
scheduled by your application on

49
00:01:37,346 --> 00:01:39,376
the device itself and then these

50
00:01:39,376 --> 00:01:40,466
get presented to the user.

51
00:01:41,006 --> 00:01:42,276
And when the user handles these

52
00:01:42,276 --> 00:01:44,086
notifications, your app has the

53
00:01:44,086 --> 00:01:45,386
opportunity to handle its

54
00:01:45,386 --> 00:01:45,876
response.

55
00:01:47,256 --> 00:01:48,666
The other kind of notifications

56
00:01:48,936 --> 00:01:50,666
are remote notifications that

57
00:01:50,666 --> 00:01:52,586
are associated with your remote

58
00:01:52,586 --> 00:01:54,796
server which then sends a

59
00:01:54,796 --> 00:01:56,516
notification payload to the

60
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:58,276
Apple push notification service.

61
00:01:58,956 --> 00:02:00,396
Now, if your payload has

62
00:01:58,956 --> 00:02:00,396
Now, if your payload has

63
00:02:00,396 --> 00:02:02,466
content, then this notification

64
00:02:02,606 --> 00:02:04,046
gets delivered to the user's

65
00:02:04,046 --> 00:02:05,456
device and presented to the

66
00:02:05,456 --> 00:02:05,796
user.

67
00:02:06,186 --> 00:02:07,666
And again, if the user handles

68
00:02:07,666 --> 00:02:09,056
this notification, you can

69
00:02:09,056 --> 00:02:10,186
handle this response in your

70
00:02:10,186 --> 00:02:10,735
application.

71
00:02:11,836 --> 00:02:12,796
The other kind of remote

72
00:02:12,796 --> 00:02:14,076
notifications are silent

73
00:02:14,076 --> 00:02:14,686
notifications.

74
00:02:15,136 --> 00:02:16,576
Now, these don't get presented

75
00:02:16,606 --> 00:02:18,746
to your application users but

76
00:02:19,146 --> 00:02:20,366
these allow your application to

77
00:02:20,366 --> 00:02:21,796
be launched in the background

78
00:02:21,916 --> 00:02:23,816
and do any extra work that your

79
00:02:23,816 --> 00:02:25,836
app wants to do associated with

80
00:02:25,836 --> 00:02:27,056
your remote site application.

81
00:02:28,476 --> 00:02:29,856
Now, it's important for remote

82
00:02:29,856 --> 00:02:32,366
notifications to use the latest

83
00:02:32,366 --> 00:02:34,556
HTTPS2, authentication method,

84
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:36,016
wherever you're doing remote

85
00:02:36,016 --> 00:02:36,736
notifications.

86
00:02:38,276 --> 00:02:39,946
Now, notification content

87
00:02:39,946 --> 00:02:41,626
exists, consists of different

88
00:02:41,626 --> 00:02:43,016
properties that you can set on

89
00:02:43,016 --> 00:02:43,686
the notification.

90
00:02:44,226 --> 00:02:46,176
These include the title, the

91
00:02:46,176 --> 00:02:48,906
subtitle, the body as well as

92
00:02:48,906 --> 00:02:50,086
media attachments that you can

93
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:52,000
set on your notifications.

94
00:02:57,046 --> 00:02:58,696
Notification triggers determine

95
00:02:58,696 --> 00:03:00,126
when your notification gets

96
00:02:58,696 --> 00:03:00,126
when your notification gets

97
00:03:00,126 --> 00:03:01,286
delivered to your app users.

98
00:03:01,876 --> 00:03:03,396
Now, all remote notifications

99
00:03:03,396 --> 00:03:04,786
are associated with the push

100
00:03:04,786 --> 00:03:06,816
trigger and for your local

101
00:03:06,816 --> 00:03:08,156
notifications, you have the

102
00:03:08,156 --> 00:03:09,876
option of using time interval,

103
00:03:10,006 --> 00:03:11,586
calendar or location-based

104
00:03:11,586 --> 00:03:11,986
triggers.

105
00:03:12,536 --> 00:03:15,496
Now, these notifications get

106
00:03:15,496 --> 00:03:16,726
presented to your user in

107
00:03:16,726 --> 00:03:17,396
different ways.

108
00:03:18,136 --> 00:03:19,836
In iOS 11, we've combined the

109
00:03:19,836 --> 00:03:22,066
notification list into a single

110
00:03:22,066 --> 00:03:22,496
list.

111
00:03:23,066 --> 00:03:24,246
So, if the user wakes their

112
00:03:24,246 --> 00:03:25,696
device or pulls down from the

113
00:03:25,696 --> 00:03:27,406
top, they get to go to the same

114
00:03:27,406 --> 00:03:28,446
notification list.

115
00:03:28,816 --> 00:03:30,246
And when the user is in that

116
00:03:30,246 --> 00:03:31,976
state, the notification gets

117
00:03:31,976 --> 00:03:33,096
added to the list right there

118
00:03:33,096 --> 00:03:33,456
and then.

119
00:03:33,946 --> 00:03:34,706
And if you want to see your

120
00:03:34,706 --> 00:03:35,836
older notifications, then you

121
00:03:35,836 --> 00:03:37,136
can just slide up on this list

122
00:03:37,136 --> 00:03:38,136
to see your notification

123
00:03:38,136 --> 00:03:38,526
history.

124
00:03:39,996 --> 00:03:41,456
If the user's device is unlocked

125
00:03:41,786 --> 00:03:42,936
if they're in the home screen or

126
00:03:42,936 --> 00:03:44,676
in any other app, then the

127
00:03:44,746 --> 00:03:45,956
notification rolls down as a

128
00:03:45,956 --> 00:03:46,796
banner from the top.

129
00:03:48,196 --> 00:03:49,646
And if your application is in

130
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:51,026
the foreground, you do have the

131
00:03:51,026 --> 00:03:52,256
option of presenting the

132
00:03:52,256 --> 00:03:53,726
notification banner right there

133
00:03:53,726 --> 00:03:54,056
and then.

134
00:03:55,076 --> 00:03:56,106
And along with these different

135
00:03:56,106 --> 00:03:57,586
presentation models, you'll also

136
00:03:57,586 --> 00:03:58,906
have the option of having a

137
00:03:59,016 --> 00:04:00,546
sound alert as well as badging

138
00:03:59,016 --> 00:04:00,546
sound alert as well as badging

139
00:04:00,596 --> 00:04:01,516
your application icon.

140
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:05,466
Now, notification actions are

141
00:04:05,466 --> 00:04:06,736
what make your notifications

142
00:04:06,736 --> 00:04:07,596
really interactable.

143
00:04:08,216 --> 00:04:10,116
And your user gets to them by 3D

144
00:04:10,116 --> 00:04:11,316
touching on the notification

145
00:04:11,456 --> 00:04:12,606
where they see the list of all

146
00:04:12,606 --> 00:04:13,976
these actions as well as the

147
00:04:13,976 --> 00:04:14,786
dismiss action.

148
00:04:15,656 --> 00:04:17,315
And then when the user takes any

149
00:04:17,315 --> 00:04:18,786
of these actions, then again you

150
00:04:18,786 --> 00:04:20,166
get the response in your

151
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:21,685
application to handle this

152
00:04:21,685 --> 00:04:22,916
action as you see fit.

153
00:04:23,376 --> 00:04:26,436
Now, there are different

154
00:04:26,436 --> 00:04:27,896
mechanisms that you can use with

155
00:04:27,896 --> 00:04:28,796
these notifications.

156
00:04:29,366 --> 00:04:31,126
Notification update allows you

157
00:04:31,126 --> 00:04:33,016
to modify notifications that you

158
00:04:33,016 --> 00:04:34,626
might have already scheduled or

159
00:04:34,626 --> 00:04:35,666
published to the user.

160
00:04:36,616 --> 00:04:37,866
In this example, you can see

161
00:04:37,866 --> 00:04:39,206
that we're aggregating the

162
00:04:39,206 --> 00:04:40,676
number of likes that your social

163
00:04:40,676 --> 00:04:41,866
media posts might have gotten.

164
00:04:42,606 --> 00:04:44,406
And after a certain time, say

165
00:04:44,726 --> 00:04:46,856
this count changes, then you can

166
00:04:46,856 --> 00:04:48,516
just go ahead and update this

167
00:04:48,516 --> 00:04:49,796
notification in place.

168
00:04:50,296 --> 00:04:52,036
So, your notification list for

169
00:04:52,036 --> 00:04:53,626
the user is not cluttered with

170
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:54,636
redundant information.

171
00:04:55,216 --> 00:04:58,416
In the same vein, you also have

172
00:04:58,416 --> 00:04:59,546
the option of removing

173
00:04:59,546 --> 00:05:00,366
notifications.

174
00:04:59,546 --> 00:05:00,366
notifications.

175
00:05:01,056 --> 00:05:02,446
In this example, there's a

176
00:05:02,446 --> 00:05:04,496
message about the video that was

177
00:05:04,496 --> 00:05:05,116
sent to you.

178
00:05:05,526 --> 00:05:07,096
And once you've seen that video,

179
00:05:07,096 --> 00:05:08,966
you can just go ahead and remove

180
00:05:08,966 --> 00:05:10,786
this notification locally by

181
00:05:10,786 --> 00:05:11,556
your applications.

182
00:05:13,996 --> 00:05:16,676
Now, with iOS 10, we introduced

183
00:05:16,676 --> 00:05:18,196
extensions to your notifications

184
00:05:18,746 --> 00:05:19,746
and there are two types of

185
00:05:19,746 --> 00:05:20,306
extensions.

186
00:05:20,896 --> 00:05:22,426
Namely, the first one is service

187
00:05:22,426 --> 00:05:22,966
extensions.

188
00:05:23,976 --> 00:05:25,546
Now, what a service extension

189
00:05:25,546 --> 00:05:27,336
allows your application to do is

190
00:05:27,606 --> 00:05:29,066
to intercept a notification

191
00:05:29,266 --> 00:05:30,786
before it gets delivered to the

192
00:05:30,786 --> 00:05:31,196
user.

193
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:33,716
So, you can modify the

194
00:05:33,716 --> 00:05:36,176
notification content or do other

195
00:05:36,426 --> 00:05:38,516
background stuff that might be

196
00:05:38,516 --> 00:05:39,186
associated with this

197
00:05:39,186 --> 00:05:40,296
notification right in the

198
00:05:40,296 --> 00:05:41,046
service extension.

199
00:05:41,546 --> 00:05:42,676
We will take a look at service

200
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,046
extensions in depth in one of

201
00:05:44,046 --> 00:05:44,916
our use cases today.

202
00:05:45,456 --> 00:05:48,126
The other extension points are

203
00:05:48,126 --> 00:05:50,066
content extensions which allow

204
00:05:50,066 --> 00:05:51,126
you to customize which

205
00:05:51,126 --> 00:05:51,806
notifications.

206
00:05:52,016 --> 00:05:53,136
And again, is one of our use

207
00:05:53,136 --> 00:05:54,446
cases of the talk today.

208
00:05:55,426 --> 00:05:56,546
Some examples of content

209
00:05:56,546 --> 00:05:57,716
extensions from first-party

210
00:05:57,716 --> 00:05:59,306
applications include the

211
00:05:59,306 --> 00:06:00,996
messages app which gives you the

212
00:05:59,306 --> 00:06:00,996
messages app which gives you the

213
00:06:00,996 --> 00:06:03,036
full thread right there in the

214
00:06:03,036 --> 00:06:04,526
notifications so you can reply

215
00:06:04,826 --> 00:06:06,586
and get responses right from the

216
00:06:06,586 --> 00:06:08,106
notification without having to

217
00:06:08,106 --> 00:06:09,106
go to the application.

218
00:06:10,576 --> 00:06:12,056
The calendar app shows the full

219
00:06:12,056 --> 00:06:13,356
schedule as well as gives you

220
00:06:13,356 --> 00:06:15,116
the option of accepting or

221
00:06:15,116 --> 00:06:16,086
declining a request.

222
00:06:17,346 --> 00:06:19,376
And the photos application sends

223
00:06:19,376 --> 00:06:20,596
you the photo within the

224
00:06:20,596 --> 00:06:22,096
notification itself and the

225
00:06:22,096 --> 00:06:23,566
ability to write or comment on

226
00:06:23,566 --> 00:06:23,636
it.

227
00:06:23,756 --> 00:06:26,716
And again, we'll look at how you

228
00:06:26,826 --> 00:06:28,036
can use all these different

229
00:06:28,036 --> 00:06:29,506
tools for creating these

230
00:06:29,506 --> 00:06:31,086
notification styles for all your

231
00:06:31,086 --> 00:06:34,256
applications in this session.

232
00:06:34,406 --> 00:06:36,156
Now, watchOS notifications work

233
00:06:36,156 --> 00:06:38,136
in sync with iOS notifications.

234
00:06:38,656 --> 00:06:40,266
All notifications that are sent

235
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:42,226
to the user's phone also get

236
00:06:42,226 --> 00:06:43,976
delivered to the user's watch if

237
00:06:44,106 --> 00:06:45,096
the phone is locked at that

238
00:06:45,096 --> 00:06:45,376
time.

239
00:06:46,476 --> 00:06:48,506
Now, if the user's watch is not

240
00:06:48,506 --> 00:06:49,906
in range of the phone, then you

241
00:06:49,906 --> 00:06:51,166
also have the ability of

242
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:53,326
scheduling notifications right

243
00:06:53,326 --> 00:06:54,746
to your watchOS apps as well.

244
00:06:56,956 --> 00:06:59,596
So, how do access all these

245
00:06:59,596 --> 00:07:01,226
different features for

246
00:06:59,596 --> 00:07:01,226
different features for

247
00:07:01,226 --> 00:07:01,936
notifications?

248
00:07:02,156 --> 00:07:03,706
For this we introduced two new

249
00:07:03,706 --> 00:07:05,436
frameworks last year, namely

250
00:07:05,436 --> 00:07:06,896
User Notifications and User

251
00:07:06,896 --> 00:07:07,796
Notifications UI.

252
00:07:09,356 --> 00:07:11,676
We went in depth covering all

253
00:07:11,676 --> 00:07:13,036
those different APIs at last

254
00:07:13,036 --> 00:07:14,916
year's WWDC and we highly

255
00:07:14,916 --> 00:07:16,286
encourage you to go check out

256
00:07:16,286 --> 00:07:17,396
these two sessions from last

257
00:07:17,396 --> 00:07:19,396
year which contains much more

258
00:07:19,396 --> 00:07:20,736
information about everything

259
00:07:20,736 --> 00:07:21,786
we've covered in the overview.

260
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:25,366
All right, let's move on and

261
00:07:25,366 --> 00:07:26,746
jump into our use cases,

262
00:07:26,996 --> 00:07:28,316
starting with the first one,

263
00:07:28,626 --> 00:07:29,936
about hidden notification

264
00:07:29,936 --> 00:07:30,396
content.

265
00:07:30,856 --> 00:07:32,166
And to tell you all about this,

266
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:34,326
let me invite Teja up here.

267
00:07:35,516 --> 00:07:39,626
[ Applause ]

268
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:40,846
&gt;&gt; Hi, everyone.

269
00:07:41,026 --> 00:07:43,036
My name is Teja Kondapalli and

270
00:07:43,036 --> 00:07:44,076
I'm also an engineer on the

271
00:07:44,076 --> 00:07:45,136
notifications team.

272
00:07:45,536 --> 00:07:47,596
You just heard a great recap of

273
00:07:47,596 --> 00:07:49,146
the API that we announced last

274
00:07:49,146 --> 00:07:50,876
year and now I'm here to talk to

275
00:07:50,876 --> 00:07:52,656
you about the API we want to

276
00:07:52,656 --> 00:07:53,526
announce this year.

277
00:07:54,636 --> 00:07:57,356
This year we decided to focus on

278
00:07:57,356 --> 00:07:59,036
a feature that we call hidden

279
00:07:59,036 --> 00:08:01,426
notification content which is a

280
00:07:59,036 --> 00:08:01,426
notification content which is a

281
00:08:01,426 --> 00:08:04,316
way for your users to hide the

282
00:08:04,316 --> 00:08:05,896
private information in their

283
00:08:05,896 --> 00:08:07,826
notifications when it doesn't

284
00:08:07,826 --> 00:08:08,686
need to be seen.

285
00:08:11,636 --> 00:08:12,826
Why do we care about this?

286
00:08:14,866 --> 00:08:16,446
It's because your users care

287
00:08:16,576 --> 00:08:17,546
about their privacy.

288
00:08:18,816 --> 00:08:20,376
We all know notifications are

289
00:08:20,376 --> 00:08:23,036
very visible and the content in

290
00:08:23,036 --> 00:08:25,136
them is richer than ever, which

291
00:08:25,136 --> 00:08:26,546
means we have to be careful

292
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:28,256
about protecting the sensitive

293
00:08:28,256 --> 00:08:30,446
information that may be in them.

294
00:08:30,446 --> 00:08:34,006
And actually, you all had a

295
00:08:34,006 --> 00:08:35,726
taste of this in iOS 10.

296
00:08:37,186 --> 00:08:38,986
A message notification on the

297
00:08:38,986 --> 00:08:40,765
lock screen could look like

298
00:08:40,826 --> 00:08:41,256
this.

299
00:08:42,576 --> 00:08:44,866
If you had gone into your

300
00:08:44,866 --> 00:08:46,926
settings under notifications,

301
00:08:48,006 --> 00:08:50,576
set for messages that you only

302
00:08:50,576 --> 00:08:52,666
want previews to be shown when

303
00:08:52,696 --> 00:08:53,226
unlocked.

304
00:08:53,906 --> 00:08:58,116
So, now you can see that the

305
00:08:58,116 --> 00:08:59,636
message, the content of the

306
00:08:59,636 --> 00:09:01,506
message is obscured, and that's

307
00:08:59,636 --> 00:09:01,506
message is obscured, and that's

308
00:09:01,586 --> 00:09:03,436
because the user is not

309
00:09:03,436 --> 00:09:04,126
authenticated.

310
00:09:04,906 --> 00:09:07,026
Once they've authenticated, the

311
00:09:07,026 --> 00:09:08,776
content of the message is

312
00:09:08,776 --> 00:09:09,166
revealed.

313
00:09:10,676 --> 00:09:11,676
And I'm really excited to

314
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:13,206
announce to you that this year

315
00:09:13,206 --> 00:09:14,506
we've extended the support of

316
00:09:14,506 --> 00:09:17,486
this to all apps, including

317
00:09:17,616 --> 00:09:19,876
third-party apps.

318
00:09:21,516 --> 00:09:24,646
[ Applause ]

319
00:09:25,146 --> 00:09:26,706
We've also given your users a

320
00:09:26,706 --> 00:09:27,656
global setting.

321
00:09:28,326 --> 00:09:30,916
They can simply go into settings

322
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:33,236
notifications and right at the

323
00:09:33,236 --> 00:09:34,826
top they can select whether they

324
00:09:34,826 --> 00:09:36,186
want their previews to be shown

325
00:09:36,586 --> 00:09:39,096
always when unlocked or never.

326
00:09:39,096 --> 00:09:41,226
And this should apply to all

327
00:09:41,226 --> 00:09:42,566
their notifications for all

328
00:09:42,566 --> 00:09:43,896
their apps.

329
00:09:44,776 --> 00:09:47,266
We've also given them a way to

330
00:09:47,266 --> 00:09:49,156
customize these settings per

331
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:49,566
app.

332
00:09:50,126 --> 00:09:53,426
So again, under settings they

333
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:54,886
can simply go to a specific

334
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:57,936
application and choose the

335
00:09:57,936 --> 00:09:59,636
privacy setting for the previews

336
00:09:59,786 --> 00:10:00,756
for that application.

337
00:09:59,786 --> 00:10:00,756
for that application.

338
00:10:01,126 --> 00:10:02,326
And they might want to fine tune

339
00:10:02,326 --> 00:10:04,226
these because some applications

340
00:10:04,536 --> 00:10:05,546
may show more sensitive

341
00:10:05,546 --> 00:10:06,786
information in their

342
00:10:06,786 --> 00:10:08,986
notifications than others.

343
00:10:11,126 --> 00:10:13,396
And now, because it's up to your

344
00:10:13,396 --> 00:10:15,306
users to determine whether a

345
00:10:15,306 --> 00:10:17,766
notification's content is hidden

346
00:10:17,766 --> 00:10:19,856
or shown at a certain point, we

347
00:10:19,856 --> 00:10:21,786
have given you as app developers

348
00:10:22,856 --> 00:10:24,686
an API to customize what a

349
00:10:24,686 --> 00:10:26,696
hidden notification might look

350
00:10:27,286 --> 00:10:27,386
like.

351
00:10:28,556 --> 00:10:30,376
So, let's take a look at this

352
00:10:30,376 --> 00:10:31,816
application I've written that

353
00:10:31,816 --> 00:10:33,216
sends me some notifications.

354
00:10:33,626 --> 00:10:34,666
And you can see here, this

355
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:36,516
notification has some rich

356
00:10:36,516 --> 00:10:38,366
information in it.

357
00:10:38,366 --> 00:10:40,316
If my user has previews turned

358
00:10:40,316 --> 00:10:42,266
off, this is what my

359
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:43,966
notification would look like.

360
00:10:44,576 --> 00:10:48,806
And as you can see, all of the

361
00:10:48,806 --> 00:10:50,706
content is hidden, the title,

362
00:10:50,706 --> 00:10:52,186
the subtitle and the body.

363
00:10:52,356 --> 00:10:54,026
And the body is replaced with a

364
00:10:54,026 --> 00:10:54,696
placeholder.

365
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:57,026
Our default placeholder says

366
00:10:57,026 --> 00:10:57,926
notification.

367
00:10:58,436 --> 00:11:03,996
But if I had a bunch of

368
00:10:58,436 --> 00:11:03,996
But if I had a bunch of

369
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:06,826
notifications associated with

370
00:11:06,826 --> 00:11:08,356
this app, then you can see here

371
00:11:08,356 --> 00:11:09,446
clearly that I have two

372
00:11:09,446 --> 00:11:10,696
different threads going on.

373
00:11:11,116 --> 00:11:13,136
One about work and the other

374
00:11:13,226 --> 00:11:14,426
about a Thai vacation.

375
00:11:15,266 --> 00:11:17,006
If my user has previews turned

376
00:11:17,006 --> 00:11:18,726
off, this is what my

377
00:11:18,726 --> 00:11:20,306
notification list could look

378
00:11:20,306 --> 00:11:20,676
like.

379
00:11:21,456 --> 00:11:23,136
But in order to prevent that, we

380
00:11:23,136 --> 00:11:25,096
went one step further and we

381
00:11:25,096 --> 00:11:26,886
have automatically coalesced

382
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:28,346
these for you by thread

383
00:11:28,346 --> 00:11:29,066
identifier.

384
00:11:29,886 --> 00:11:31,476
So, if you're already using

385
00:11:31,476 --> 00:11:32,506
thread identifiers in your

386
00:11:32,506 --> 00:11:34,316
notifications, this will work

387
00:11:34,436 --> 00:11:35,506
automatically for you.

388
00:11:36,046 --> 00:11:38,796
Let's take a look at one of my

389
00:11:38,796 --> 00:11:39,126
threads.

390
00:11:39,856 --> 00:11:40,896
You can see here it says two

391
00:11:40,896 --> 00:11:42,506
notifications of the default

392
00:11:42,506 --> 00:11:43,056
placeholder.

393
00:11:43,056 --> 00:11:45,476
And this thread is actually

394
00:11:45,586 --> 00:11:46,856
about my Thai vacation.

395
00:11:47,846 --> 00:11:49,156
And these are comments.

396
00:11:49,266 --> 00:11:50,516
So, I want to customize this

397
00:11:50,516 --> 00:11:53,566
further and we can do that.

398
00:11:53,786 --> 00:11:54,616
When I'm setting up my

399
00:11:54,616 --> 00:11:56,726
notification category that I'm

400
00:11:56,726 --> 00:11:57,926
going to associate with these

401
00:11:57,926 --> 00:12:00,666
notifications, I can pass it a

402
00:11:57,926 --> 00:12:00,666
notifications, I can pass it a

403
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:03,246
new, a value for a new property.

404
00:12:03,886 --> 00:12:05,426
So, here I'm setting up a

405
00:12:05,426 --> 00:12:09,306
comment category and I am also

406
00:12:09,306 --> 00:12:10,706
setting the hidden previews body

407
00:12:10,706 --> 00:12:11,296
placeholder.

408
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:13,276
I'm just passing in a regular

409
00:12:13,276 --> 00:12:14,996
string here and it says comment.

410
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:17,926
And now my notification looks

411
00:12:17,926 --> 00:12:18,306
like this.

412
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:21,026
Which is still not quite right

413
00:12:21,386 --> 00:12:22,976
because I know that there's two

414
00:12:22,976 --> 00:12:24,046
notifications that have been

415
00:12:24,046 --> 00:12:25,986
coalesced and this just says

416
00:12:25,986 --> 00:12:26,416
comment.

417
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:29,926
So, instead I decide to pass in

418
00:12:30,556 --> 00:12:31,466
a format string.

419
00:12:32,016 --> 00:12:34,616
Which is great.

420
00:12:34,826 --> 00:12:36,716
Now my notification looks as

421
00:12:36,716 --> 00:12:37,186
intended.

422
00:12:37,186 --> 00:12:38,416
It says 2 comments.

423
00:12:39,096 --> 00:12:41,156
But this is not going to work

424
00:12:41,156 --> 00:12:42,146
for the singular case.

425
00:12:42,956 --> 00:12:45,716
It would've said 1 comments if I

426
00:12:45,716 --> 00:12:47,256
had just one notification.

427
00:12:48,096 --> 00:12:50,516
Luckily there's already a way to

428
00:12:50,516 --> 00:12:52,696
account for the singular-plural

429
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:55,486
problem that's already supported

430
00:12:55,706 --> 00:12:57,776
by foundation, and that's a

431
00:12:57,776 --> 00:12:59,136
strings dictionary.

432
00:12:59,706 --> 00:13:03,126
A strings dictionary is a p-list

433
00:12:59,706 --> 00:13:03,126
A strings dictionary is a p-list

434
00:13:03,126 --> 00:13:04,626
file that sits in your project.

435
00:13:05,306 --> 00:13:06,316
And you can, and it looks

436
00:13:06,316 --> 00:13:07,426
somewhat like this.

437
00:13:07,646 --> 00:13:09,326
You can see here that the first

438
00:13:09,326 --> 00:13:12,246
thing I have is a line that says

439
00:13:12,316 --> 00:13:13,196
comment key.

440
00:13:13,496 --> 00:13:16,286
And this indicates to a system

441
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:18,236
where to find this pluralization

442
00:13:18,236 --> 00:13:18,606
rule.

443
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:22,576
And below that you can see that

444
00:13:22,576 --> 00:13:24,416
I have a key value mapping for

445
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:26,586
the singular and plural rules.

446
00:13:26,886 --> 00:13:28,966
It says 1 with a format string

447
00:13:28,966 --> 00:13:30,836
that says comment and other,

448
00:13:31,186 --> 00:13:32,866
with a format string that says

449
00:13:33,246 --> 00:13:33,616
comments.

450
00:13:34,376 --> 00:13:36,436
And it's important to use a

451
00:13:36,436 --> 00:13:38,786
strings dictionary because not

452
00:13:38,786 --> 00:13:40,946
all languages have a distinction

453
00:13:40,946 --> 00:13:42,606
just between singular and

454
00:13:42,606 --> 00:13:42,996
plural.

455
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:45,406
For example, a strings

456
00:13:45,406 --> 00:13:49,146
dictionary in Arabic looks like

457
00:13:50,536 --> 00:13:50,646
this.

458
00:13:50,856 --> 00:13:52,726
And you can see there are a lot

459
00:13:52,726 --> 00:13:54,616
more options than just singular

460
00:13:54,896 --> 00:13:55,526
and plural.

461
00:13:55,896 --> 00:13:57,956
So, to account for pluralization

462
00:13:58,016 --> 00:14:00,306
as well as localization, it's

463
00:13:58,016 --> 00:14:00,306
as well as localization, it's

464
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:01,916
important to use strings

465
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:02,436
dictionaries.

466
00:14:03,266 --> 00:14:04,156
So, now that I've set up my

467
00:14:04,156 --> 00:14:07,246
strings dictionary, when I'm

468
00:14:07,466 --> 00:14:09,156
setting up my comment category,

469
00:14:09,156 --> 00:14:10,306
instead of passing in just a

470
00:14:10,306 --> 00:14:12,376
format string, I'm passing in an

471
00:14:12,426 --> 00:14:13,486
NS localized string.

472
00:14:13,736 --> 00:14:15,736
And the first parameter that I

473
00:14:15,736 --> 00:14:18,026
pass to it is comment key which

474
00:14:18,026 --> 00:14:19,586
is what I associated my

475
00:14:19,586 --> 00:14:21,166
pluralization rule with, the key

476
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:22,076
that I associated with.

477
00:14:22,076 --> 00:14:24,816
And the second parameter that

478
00:14:24,816 --> 00:14:26,466
I'm passing is just a note about

479
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:30,806
what this string is about.

480
00:14:31,006 --> 00:14:32,656
If you want to know more about

481
00:14:32,656 --> 00:14:35,016
localization, we had a chat

482
00:14:35,016 --> 00:14:37,956
earlier during WWDC, so you can

483
00:14:37,956 --> 00:14:39,336
catch that on video.

484
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:41,156
And we also have great resources

485
00:14:41,436 --> 00:14:43,986
in our docs.

486
00:14:44,126 --> 00:14:45,836
And now, my notification

487
00:14:45,836 --> 00:14:47,696
correctly says 2 comments and I

488
00:14:47,696 --> 00:14:48,736
have confidence that it's going

489
00:14:48,736 --> 00:14:50,956
to say 1 comment if there had

490
00:14:50,956 --> 00:14:52,526
only been 1 comment in here.

491
00:14:53,086 --> 00:14:57,446
But if we look further, actually

492
00:14:58,016 --> 00:15:00,236
Jane sent me an image.

493
00:14:58,016 --> 00:15:00,236
Jane sent me an image.

494
00:15:00,286 --> 00:15:01,766
She didn't send me a comment,

495
00:15:02,046 --> 00:15:03,416
and I want to indicate that.

496
00:15:03,896 --> 00:15:05,386
So, I can do that as well.

497
00:15:05,966 --> 00:15:06,726
When I'm setting up my

498
00:15:06,726 --> 00:15:08,616
categories, after I set up my

499
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:11,086
comment category, I also set up

500
00:15:11,086 --> 00:15:12,776
an image category the same way

501
00:15:13,426 --> 00:15:15,606
and I associate Jane's

502
00:15:15,606 --> 00:15:17,076
notification with the image

503
00:15:17,076 --> 00:15:19,056
category and John's notification

504
00:15:19,056 --> 00:15:20,186
with a comment category.

505
00:15:20,716 --> 00:15:23,116
Now I have two notifications

506
00:15:23,116 --> 00:15:24,716
with two different categories

507
00:15:25,106 --> 00:15:26,196
but they're being sent to the

508
00:15:26,196 --> 00:15:27,146
same thread.

509
00:15:27,976 --> 00:15:29,666
So, the coalescing will

510
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:31,436
automatically work for me and it

511
00:15:31,436 --> 00:15:33,656
correctly says 1 image and 1

512
00:15:33,756 --> 00:15:34,146
comment.

513
00:15:34,686 --> 00:15:38,706
But if you recall further, this

514
00:15:38,706 --> 00:15:40,256
is all one thread and maybe I

515
00:15:40,256 --> 00:15:41,606
want to distinguish this thread

516
00:15:41,966 --> 00:15:44,326
from another thread that is also

517
00:15:44,326 --> 00:15:46,056
for the notifications in this

518
00:15:46,056 --> 00:15:46,826
application.

519
00:15:47,356 --> 00:15:48,076
And I can do that.

520
00:15:48,276 --> 00:15:50,326
So if you see here, the title

521
00:15:50,326 --> 00:15:51,736
says Thai vacation and that's

522
00:15:51,736 --> 00:15:54,146
indicative of what thread this

523
00:15:54,756 --> 00:15:54,906
is.

524
00:15:55,066 --> 00:15:56,226
So, maybe I want to show that.

525
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:59,566
And again, when I'm setting up

526
00:15:59,736 --> 00:16:02,926
my categories, I can pass in one

527
00:15:59,736 --> 00:16:02,926
my categories, I can pass in one

528
00:16:03,126 --> 00:16:05,036
or both of two new options that

529
00:16:05,036 --> 00:16:05,426
we have.

530
00:16:05,886 --> 00:16:07,926
Hidden previews show title and

531
00:16:07,926 --> 00:16:09,966
hidden previews shows subtitle.

532
00:16:10,616 --> 00:16:12,776
So, here I'm just trying to pass

533
00:16:12,776 --> 00:16:15,066
in, I'm just passing in the

534
00:16:15,066 --> 00:16:15,526
title.

535
00:16:15,786 --> 00:16:17,976
Because showing the subtitle is

536
00:16:17,976 --> 00:16:19,456
revealing too much information.

537
00:16:19,496 --> 00:16:20,826
I just want to show the title.

538
00:16:22,046 --> 00:16:23,506
And now my notification

539
00:16:23,506 --> 00:16:25,756
correctly says Thai vacation,

540
00:16:25,996 --> 00:16:27,976
which indicates the thread, 1

541
00:16:27,976 --> 00:16:29,276
image and 1 comment.

542
00:16:29,276 --> 00:16:33,606
Now that we know how to

543
00:16:33,606 --> 00:16:35,846
customize hidden notification

544
00:16:35,846 --> 00:16:37,556
content, it's important to

545
00:16:37,556 --> 00:16:38,506
remember that this is a

546
00:16:38,506 --> 00:16:39,766
user-defined setting.

547
00:16:40,186 --> 00:16:41,636
It's up to your users at any

548
00:16:41,636 --> 00:16:43,326
point to determine whether a

549
00:16:43,326 --> 00:16:44,776
notification content is going to

550
00:16:44,776 --> 00:16:46,346
be hidden or shown.

551
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:49,886
We've given you a way to find

552
00:16:50,326 --> 00:16:52,016
the user's setting and you can

553
00:16:52,016 --> 00:16:53,966
retrieve it by using the show

554
00:16:53,966 --> 00:16:56,296
preview setting property in view

555
00:16:56,296 --> 00:16:57,746
and notification settings.

556
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:01,176
It's also important to use

557
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:01,176
It's also important to use

558
00:17:01,226 --> 00:17:02,566
thread identifiers to take

559
00:17:02,566 --> 00:17:03,776
advantage of the automatic

560
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:05,876
coalescing that we already have

561
00:17:06,455 --> 00:17:07,256
supported for you.

562
00:17:08,116 --> 00:17:09,796
And it's important to use

563
00:17:09,796 --> 00:17:11,786
strings dictionaries to account

564
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:14,056
for pluralization as well as

565
00:17:14,056 --> 00:17:14,896
localization.

566
00:17:15,465 --> 00:17:19,915
So, we've looked at our first

567
00:17:19,915 --> 00:17:22,096
use case of hidden notification

568
00:17:22,096 --> 00:17:22,646
content.

569
00:17:22,976 --> 00:17:24,806
And the second use case is

570
00:17:24,806 --> 00:17:26,406
something I know a lot of you

571
00:17:26,406 --> 00:17:27,606
will be doing, which is sending

572
00:17:27,606 --> 00:17:29,256
push notifications to your

573
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:29,916
applications.

574
00:17:30,206 --> 00:17:31,586
And we can do some interesting

575
00:17:31,586 --> 00:17:33,236
things with push notifications

576
00:17:33,596 --> 00:17:35,196
if only we're able to modify

577
00:17:35,196 --> 00:17:36,576
them, such as attachments or

578
00:17:36,576 --> 00:17:37,096
encryption.

579
00:17:37,096 --> 00:17:41,296
And what I mean by that is

580
00:17:41,516 --> 00:17:42,816
imagine I want to send some

581
00:17:42,816 --> 00:17:44,246
media with my remote

582
00:17:44,776 --> 00:17:45,966
notification.

583
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:48,036
But that media doesn't fit in

584
00:17:48,036 --> 00:17:48,936
the push payload.

585
00:17:49,826 --> 00:17:51,866
Well, I can instead send some

586
00:17:51,866 --> 00:17:53,846
metadata about this media such

587
00:17:53,846 --> 00:17:55,406
as the URL that it can be found

588
00:17:55,406 --> 00:17:58,936
at and then on the device I can

589
00:17:58,936 --> 00:18:01,706
download that media and then

590
00:17:58,936 --> 00:18:01,706
download that media and then

591
00:18:01,706 --> 00:18:02,816
present the notification.

592
00:18:05,616 --> 00:18:08,296
Another great example is if your

593
00:18:08,296 --> 00:18:10,436
server side wants to encrypt a

594
00:18:10,436 --> 00:18:12,636
content in the notification, you

595
00:18:12,636 --> 00:18:13,716
would want to decrypt it on the

596
00:18:13,716 --> 00:18:15,486
device before displaying it to

597
00:18:15,486 --> 00:18:16,046
the user.

598
00:18:16,576 --> 00:18:19,886
And another great application is

599
00:18:20,376 --> 00:18:21,916
a pending context-specific

600
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:24,066
information to your notification

601
00:18:25,236 --> 00:18:27,446
such as location or time or

602
00:18:27,446 --> 00:18:28,066
health data.

603
00:18:29,106 --> 00:18:30,486
This information may only be

604
00:18:30,486 --> 00:18:31,836
present on the user's device.

605
00:18:32,196 --> 00:18:33,706
So, before it's presented to the

606
00:18:33,706 --> 00:18:35,396
user, you can append these to

607
00:18:35,396 --> 00:18:36,216
your notification.

608
00:18:36,736 --> 00:18:40,206
And to do all this, we would a

609
00:18:40,266 --> 00:18:41,816
service extension, which is

610
00:18:41,816 --> 00:18:43,196
something we introduced last

611
00:18:43,766 --> 00:18:43,876
year.

612
00:18:44,876 --> 00:18:46,816
So, let's deep dive and look at

613
00:18:46,816 --> 00:18:47,526
an example.

614
00:18:48,206 --> 00:18:50,316
I want to send a video with my

615
00:18:50,316 --> 00:18:51,456
remote notification.

616
00:18:52,786 --> 00:18:55,686
So, my remote server would send

617
00:18:55,686 --> 00:18:56,896
a push payload to APNS.

618
00:18:56,896 --> 00:18:59,366
And in the payload, I packaged

619
00:18:59,366 --> 00:19:00,806
some metadata about my video.

620
00:18:59,366 --> 00:19:00,806
some metadata about my video.

621
00:19:02,546 --> 00:19:03,976
The notification will then get

622
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,896
delivered to my device and the

623
00:19:05,896 --> 00:19:07,086
service extension has the

624
00:19:07,086 --> 00:19:08,976
opportunity to intercept this

625
00:19:08,976 --> 00:19:09,816
notification.

626
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:12,356
At that point, I can talk to the

627
00:19:12,356 --> 00:19:14,906
remote server and download a

628
00:19:14,906 --> 00:19:17,286
video preview before attaching

629
00:19:17,286 --> 00:19:19,536
it to my notification and

630
00:19:19,536 --> 00:19:21,006
displaying it to the user.

631
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:22,976
Let's see how we do this in

632
00:19:23,706 --> 00:19:23,806
code.

633
00:19:25,556 --> 00:19:27,466
The remote payload would look

634
00:19:27,466 --> 00:19:28,366
something like this.

635
00:19:29,256 --> 00:19:30,796
It's important to set the

636
00:19:30,796 --> 00:19:32,166
mutable content flag.

637
00:19:32,556 --> 00:19:33,776
This is what indicates to the

638
00:19:33,776 --> 00:19:35,646
device that it needs to launch

639
00:19:35,686 --> 00:19:37,906
the service extension before

640
00:19:37,906 --> 00:19:39,236
presenting the notification.

641
00:19:40,156 --> 00:19:42,276
And I also have some additional

642
00:19:42,276 --> 00:19:44,816
metadata such as the type of

643
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:47,286
this media, the video URL, the

644
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:49,786
location that it was shot at and

645
00:19:49,816 --> 00:19:52,856
also the user that uploaded

646
00:19:55,116 --> 00:19:55,216
this.

647
00:19:55,436 --> 00:19:56,656
Now, when setting up the service

648
00:19:56,656 --> 00:19:58,686
extension, I simply go into

649
00:19:58,686 --> 00:20:00,806
Xcode, create a new target and

650
00:19:58,686 --> 00:20:00,806
Xcode, create a new target and

651
00:20:00,806 --> 00:20:02,806
select the notification service

652
00:20:02,806 --> 00:20:04,016
extension template.

653
00:20:04,556 --> 00:20:06,696
And I would get a template that

654
00:20:06,696 --> 00:20:07,756
looks something like this.

655
00:20:08,676 --> 00:20:10,186
So, in the service extension,

656
00:20:10,296 --> 00:20:11,676
when a notification gets

657
00:20:11,676 --> 00:20:14,756
delivered, you'll receive a call

658
00:20:14,756 --> 00:20:16,136
to the did receive request with

659
00:20:16,176 --> 00:20:17,536
content handler function.

660
00:20:18,016 --> 00:20:19,126
And the first thing I do in

661
00:20:19,126 --> 00:20:21,086
there is store both the content

662
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:24,186
handler and the remote content

663
00:20:24,186 --> 00:20:24,726
that was sent.

664
00:20:25,376 --> 00:20:26,696
Just in case I'm not able to

665
00:20:26,696 --> 00:20:28,246
complete my operation, this is

666
00:20:28,246 --> 00:20:28,696
my backup.

667
00:20:29,266 --> 00:20:30,486
So, I've stored those.

668
00:20:31,026 --> 00:20:35,626
And then I can handle my request

669
00:20:35,996 --> 00:20:36,656
the way that I want.

670
00:20:36,766 --> 00:20:39,706
So, the first thing I do here is

671
00:20:39,706 --> 00:20:42,816
I grab the video URL from the

672
00:20:42,816 --> 00:20:43,686
remote payload.

673
00:20:44,036 --> 00:20:46,306
And because this was some custom

674
00:20:46,376 --> 00:20:48,626
metadata, I use the user info

675
00:20:48,626 --> 00:20:51,186
dictionary to access this value.

676
00:20:52,716 --> 00:20:54,876
The next thing I do is download

677
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:56,576
from that URL using whatever

678
00:20:56,576 --> 00:20:59,776
mechanism I want and I pass a

679
00:20:59,776 --> 00:21:01,336
completion handler to my

680
00:20:59,776 --> 00:21:01,336
completion handler to my

681
00:21:01,336 --> 00:21:03,726
download method that I want to

682
00:21:03,726 --> 00:21:05,346
execute after the download is

683
00:21:05,346 --> 00:21:05,966
complete.

684
00:21:06,286 --> 00:21:09,936
After the download completes, I

685
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:11,656
take that file and I create an

686
00:21:11,656 --> 00:21:12,536
attachment out of it.

687
00:21:13,516 --> 00:21:15,596
I attach it to my notification

688
00:21:15,596 --> 00:21:17,216
content and I send my

689
00:21:17,216 --> 00:21:19,736
notification on its way.

690
00:21:20,316 --> 00:21:23,446
And now my notification looks

691
00:21:23,446 --> 00:21:23,896
great.

692
00:21:23,896 --> 00:21:26,516
It has an attachment, a video

693
00:21:26,516 --> 00:21:27,996
attachment attached to it.

694
00:21:29,176 --> 00:21:30,646
But what if I'm not able to

695
00:21:30,646 --> 00:21:32,696
complete the downloading of the

696
00:21:32,696 --> 00:21:34,636
video in the set time?

697
00:21:34,636 --> 00:21:36,176
There is a limit on the amount

698
00:21:36,176 --> 00:21:37,636
of time that I have to use in my

699
00:21:37,636 --> 00:21:38,556
service extension.

700
00:21:39,686 --> 00:21:41,126
So, if I'm not able to do that,

701
00:21:41,126 --> 00:21:43,196
there is a fallback, and this a

702
00:21:43,196 --> 00:21:45,006
function that we call also in

703
00:21:45,006 --> 00:21:46,616
the service extension called

704
00:21:46,706 --> 00:21:48,126
service extension time will

705
00:21:48,126 --> 00:21:48,616
expire.

706
00:21:49,746 --> 00:21:52,566
In here, I can make use of both

707
00:21:52,566 --> 00:21:53,976
the content handler and the

708
00:21:53,976 --> 00:21:55,216
content that I had stored

709
00:21:55,216 --> 00:21:55,796
earlier.

710
00:21:56,296 --> 00:22:01,056
And the first thing I do is I

711
00:21:56,296 --> 00:22:01,056
And the first thing I do is I

712
00:22:01,056 --> 00:22:03,776
grab the type of media this is

713
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:05,586
that I had also packaged with my

714
00:22:05,586 --> 00:22:07,926
metadata and I just set the

715
00:22:07,926 --> 00:22:10,986
title to say incoming media, or

716
00:22:10,986 --> 00:22:12,726
incoming video.

717
00:22:13,346 --> 00:22:15,056
And I send my notification on

718
00:22:15,056 --> 00:22:15,366
its way.

719
00:22:15,736 --> 00:22:18,836
Now that we know how to use

720
00:22:18,986 --> 00:22:21,376
service extension, let's

721
00:22:21,376 --> 00:22:22,306
remember few things.

722
00:22:22,306 --> 00:22:24,406
Which is that there is a short

723
00:22:24,406 --> 00:22:25,306
execution time.

724
00:22:25,306 --> 00:22:26,446
There's a limit on execution

725
00:22:26,446 --> 00:22:28,046
time and there's also a memory

726
00:22:28,046 --> 00:22:28,366
limit.

727
00:22:29,296 --> 00:22:31,986
But make use of the fallback in

728
00:22:31,986 --> 00:22:34,216
order to do the best possible

729
00:22:34,216 --> 00:22:35,966
thing for that notification if

730
00:22:35,966 --> 00:22:37,286
you're unable to complete your

731
00:22:37,286 --> 00:22:37,846
operation.

732
00:22:38,976 --> 00:22:40,296
It's also important to note the

733
00:22:40,296 --> 00:22:42,326
notification that can be handled

734
00:22:42,326 --> 00:22:44,286
by the service extension are UI

735
00:22:44,286 --> 00:22:46,336
notification and they will be

736
00:22:46,466 --> 00:22:47,006
presented.

737
00:22:48,156 --> 00:22:49,456
And these are different from

738
00:22:49,456 --> 00:22:50,716
silent notifications.

739
00:22:51,776 --> 00:22:55,786
What I mean by that is when APNS

740
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:57,346
delivers the notification to

741
00:22:57,346 --> 00:22:59,016
your device, the service

742
00:22:59,016 --> 00:23:01,146
extension has the opportunity to

743
00:22:59,016 --> 00:23:01,146
extension has the opportunity to

744
00:23:01,146 --> 00:23:02,506
intercept it, as we just saw.

745
00:23:03,196 --> 00:23:05,036
Any and all work done in the

746
00:23:05,036 --> 00:23:07,126
service extension should pertain

747
00:23:07,126 --> 00:23:08,816
to this incoming notification.

748
00:23:09,176 --> 00:23:10,226
There should be no additional

749
00:23:10,226 --> 00:23:12,216
background work for your

750
00:23:12,216 --> 00:23:13,556
application that should be done

751
00:23:13,556 --> 00:23:13,946
here.

752
00:23:14,596 --> 00:23:15,916
All work should be either about

753
00:23:15,916 --> 00:23:17,666
modifying or enhancing this

754
00:23:17,666 --> 00:23:18,386
notification.

755
00:23:19,026 --> 00:23:20,516
The service extension also

756
00:23:20,516 --> 00:23:23,156
doesn't have the power to drop

757
00:23:23,156 --> 00:23:24,666
this notification or prevent it

758
00:23:24,666 --> 00:23:25,896
from being displayed.

759
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:27,326
This notification will get

760
00:23:27,326 --> 00:23:29,536
delivered to the device.

761
00:23:30,666 --> 00:23:33,366
If instead you want to launch

762
00:23:33,366 --> 00:23:34,056
your application in the

763
00:23:34,056 --> 00:23:35,136
background and run some

764
00:23:35,136 --> 00:23:37,506
additional processing, you

765
00:23:37,506 --> 00:23:38,926
should send a silent

766
00:23:38,926 --> 00:23:39,646
notification.

767
00:23:40,486 --> 00:23:42,226
You can also send a silent

768
00:23:42,226 --> 00:23:44,516
notification and launch your app

769
00:23:44,516 --> 00:23:45,546
in the background and your app

770
00:23:45,836 --> 00:23:47,286
can determine whether or not to

771
00:23:47,286 --> 00:23:49,436
schedule a local notification if

772
00:23:49,436 --> 00:23:50,356
you want to present a

773
00:23:50,356 --> 00:23:51,786
conditional notification.

774
00:23:52,366 --> 00:23:56,006
So, now I have my great

775
00:23:56,006 --> 00:23:57,416
notification with an attachment

776
00:23:57,816 --> 00:23:59,346
and let's say I 3D touch to go

777
00:23:59,346 --> 00:24:00,826
into the rich notification.

778
00:23:59,346 --> 00:24:00,826
into the rich notification.

779
00:24:01,486 --> 00:24:02,696
Without doing anything, this is

780
00:24:02,696 --> 00:24:04,016
my default look.

781
00:24:04,596 --> 00:24:06,236
Which looks good, but I might

782
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:07,266
want to customize it.

783
00:24:07,856 --> 00:24:09,706
And in order to show you guys

784
00:24:09,706 --> 00:24:11,176
how to customize these views,

785
00:24:11,206 --> 00:24:12,486
I'm going to invite Kritharth

786
00:24:12,486 --> 00:24:14,976
back up on stage.

787
00:24:16,516 --> 00:24:19,496
[ Applause ]

788
00:24:19,996 --> 00:24:20,626
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Teja.

789
00:24:21,186 --> 00:24:22,656
So, so far we've looked at our

790
00:24:22,656 --> 00:24:23,736
first two use cases.

791
00:24:23,926 --> 00:24:25,236
The first about hidden

792
00:24:25,236 --> 00:24:26,646
notification content and how we

793
00:24:26,646 --> 00:24:27,586
can customize them.

794
00:24:28,406 --> 00:24:29,916
And secondly about modifying

795
00:24:29,916 --> 00:24:31,116
push notification content.

796
00:24:32,106 --> 00:24:33,596
Let's move to our third use case

797
00:24:33,596 --> 00:24:34,836
about customizing rich

798
00:24:34,836 --> 00:24:35,506
notifications.

799
00:24:36,536 --> 00:24:39,336
Now, as we just saw, this is the

800
00:24:39,336 --> 00:24:41,946
default look for a media

801
00:24:41,946 --> 00:24:43,316
attachment rich notification.

802
00:24:43,916 --> 00:24:45,476
We overlay the video with the

803
00:24:45,476 --> 00:24:47,196
play button so that the user can

804
00:24:47,196 --> 00:24:48,686
play the media right there and

805
00:24:48,686 --> 00:24:51,236
then as well as default content

806
00:24:51,236 --> 00:24:52,066
shown right below it.

807
00:24:52,806 --> 00:24:54,006
And if there was no media

808
00:24:54,006 --> 00:24:55,796
attached to it, then all that

809
00:24:55,796 --> 00:24:57,176
the rich notification would show

810
00:24:57,316 --> 00:24:58,546
would be the default content.

811
00:24:59,676 --> 00:25:01,276
But what if you want to

812
00:24:59,676 --> 00:25:01,276
But what if you want to

813
00:25:01,326 --> 00:25:03,176
customize this rich notification

814
00:25:03,606 --> 00:25:05,426
and give it a custom look and

815
00:25:05,426 --> 00:25:06,896
feel that's specific to your

816
00:25:06,896 --> 00:25:07,496
application?

817
00:25:08,906 --> 00:25:10,546
What if you want to completely

818
00:25:10,546 --> 00:25:12,126
custom9ize the display of this

819
00:25:12,126 --> 00:25:14,186
notification content as you want

820
00:25:14,186 --> 00:25:14,526
to do.

821
00:25:15,576 --> 00:25:17,176
And in the process you make

822
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:19,046
these notifications very

823
00:25:19,046 --> 00:25:21,216
interactive and dynamic for your

824
00:25:21,216 --> 00:25:22,966
users so that they can complete

825
00:25:22,966 --> 00:25:24,666
these operations right in the

826
00:25:24,666 --> 00:25:26,306
notification without having the

827
00:25:26,306 --> 00:25:27,666
need to go to the application.

828
00:25:28,486 --> 00:25:30,456
Well, we can achieve all of this

829
00:25:30,456 --> 00:25:32,516
and for that we use our second

830
00:25:32,516 --> 00:25:34,096
extension point of content

831
00:25:34,096 --> 00:25:34,646
extensions.

832
00:25:35,176 --> 00:25:36,606
So, let's take a look how we can

833
00:25:36,606 --> 00:25:38,246
set content extensions up.

834
00:25:39,606 --> 00:25:41,006
So, so far we've seen that the

835
00:25:41,006 --> 00:25:42,386
service extension was where we

836
00:25:42,386 --> 00:25:44,036
downloaded the media and then

837
00:25:44,296 --> 00:25:45,586
the notification was presented

838
00:25:45,586 --> 00:25:46,516
on the user's device.

839
00:25:47,536 --> 00:25:48,866
Now, if you have a content

840
00:25:48,866 --> 00:25:51,116
extension set up having the same

841
00:25:51,116 --> 00:25:52,596
category identifier as the

842
00:25:52,596 --> 00:25:54,596
notification, then the system

843
00:25:54,596 --> 00:25:55,596
will launch this content

844
00:25:55,596 --> 00:25:56,086
extension.

845
00:25:56,466 --> 00:25:57,796
And set up all the different

846
00:25:57,796 --> 00:25:59,066
views and view controllers

847
00:25:59,126 --> 00:26:00,816
associated with this content

848
00:25:59,126 --> 00:26:00,816
associated with this content

849
00:26:00,816 --> 00:26:03,546
extension before opening the

850
00:26:03,546 --> 00:26:04,356
rich notification.

851
00:26:04,516 --> 00:26:05,536
And then uses these view

852
00:26:05,536 --> 00:26:07,196
controllers to present that

853
00:26:07,196 --> 00:26:08,886
custom rich notification user

854
00:26:09,156 --> 00:26:09,846
interface.

855
00:26:10,366 --> 00:26:13,126
What are the different things

856
00:26:13,256 --> 00:26:14,976
that you can customize as part

857
00:26:14,976 --> 00:26:16,106
of these rich notifications?

858
00:26:16,936 --> 00:26:18,396
You can change the title that's

859
00:26:18,396 --> 00:26:20,186
right above the content.

860
00:26:21,316 --> 00:26:22,976
You can completely customize the

861
00:26:22,976 --> 00:26:24,366
content and the way it's shown.

862
00:26:25,906 --> 00:26:26,996
And you also have the option of

863
00:26:26,996 --> 00:26:28,066
just removing the default

864
00:26:28,066 --> 00:26:29,566
content if you've already

865
00:26:29,566 --> 00:26:31,166
included that information in

866
00:26:31,166 --> 00:26:32,026
your custom section.

867
00:26:32,646 --> 00:26:35,866
So, to set up a content

868
00:26:35,866 --> 00:26:37,826
extension, Xcode gives you a

869
00:26:37,826 --> 00:26:39,206
default template to get you

870
00:26:39,206 --> 00:26:39,626
started.

871
00:26:40,316 --> 00:26:43,046
In this customization process,

872
00:26:43,046 --> 00:26:44,356
the first place where we look is

873
00:26:44,356 --> 00:26:45,176
the info.plist.

874
00:26:45,956 --> 00:26:46,926
Now, of course the first thing

875
00:26:46,926 --> 00:26:48,346
we do is set the correct

876
00:26:48,346 --> 00:26:49,416
category for all the

877
00:26:49,416 --> 00:26:50,956
notifications that we want to

878
00:26:50,956 --> 00:26:52,276
associate with this content

879
00:26:52,276 --> 00:26:52,706
extension.

880
00:26:53,346 --> 00:26:55,616
Now, some of the easy ones we

881
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:57,286
can get here are by setting the

882
00:26:57,286 --> 00:26:58,986
default content hidden flag to

883
00:26:58,986 --> 00:26:59,356
Yes.

884
00:26:59,356 --> 00:27:00,816
And this, we'll just go ahead

885
00:26:59,356 --> 00:27:00,816
And this, we'll just go ahead

886
00:27:00,816 --> 00:27:02,186
and remove the default content

887
00:27:02,386 --> 00:27:04,486
before, below your custom UI.

888
00:27:06,066 --> 00:27:07,686
And also by overriding the

889
00:27:07,686 --> 00:27:10,146
default title, you can do that

890
00:27:10,146 --> 00:27:11,596
by simply setting this flag here

891
00:27:12,376 --> 00:27:14,066
as well.

892
00:27:14,276 --> 00:27:16,246
Now, when we look at our code,

893
00:27:16,476 --> 00:27:17,716
you can see here that our class

894
00:27:17,716 --> 00:27:19,016
notification view controller

895
00:27:19,106 --> 00:27:20,816
implements the UN notification

896
00:27:20,996 --> 00:27:22,456
content extension protocol.

897
00:27:22,866 --> 00:27:25,316
Now, the entry method into your

898
00:27:25,316 --> 00:27:27,206
content extension is the did

899
00:27:27,206 --> 00:27:28,736
receive notification method.

900
00:27:29,376 --> 00:27:30,796
The UN notification object here

901
00:27:30,796 --> 00:27:32,156
contains all the information

902
00:27:32,276 --> 00:27:33,406
that's pertinent to this

903
00:27:33,406 --> 00:27:33,956
notification.

904
00:27:35,176 --> 00:27:36,486
So, the first thing that we do

905
00:27:36,486 --> 00:27:37,946
is go ahead and extract the

906
00:27:37,996 --> 00:27:39,386
content from this notification.

907
00:27:40,716 --> 00:27:41,916
And then we can just go ahead

908
00:27:41,916 --> 00:27:43,316
and get the attachment that we

909
00:27:43,316 --> 00:27:44,556
had downloaded in our service

910
00:27:44,556 --> 00:27:45,206
extension here.

911
00:27:45,836 --> 00:27:48,566
And then we go and set it up in

912
00:27:48,566 --> 00:27:50,156
our custom media player that we

913
00:27:50,156 --> 00:27:51,936
set up in our custom UI.

914
00:27:53,056 --> 00:27:54,366
There are more things we can do

915
00:27:54,366 --> 00:27:55,336
in this customization.

916
00:27:55,926 --> 00:27:58,216
One of the things is setting the

917
00:27:58,216 --> 00:27:59,866
title that we had overridden at

918
00:27:59,866 --> 00:28:01,056
the top of the content

919
00:27:59,866 --> 00:28:01,056
the top of the content

920
00:28:01,056 --> 00:28:01,456
extension.

921
00:28:02,046 --> 00:28:05,216
Now, the user info object is a

922
00:28:05,286 --> 00:28:07,156
key value pairing that you can

923
00:28:07,156 --> 00:28:08,666
associate with your notification

924
00:28:08,666 --> 00:28:10,836
payload which allows you to send

925
00:28:10,836 --> 00:28:12,326
a lot more information.

926
00:28:12,946 --> 00:28:14,116
So that you're not restricted to

927
00:28:14,116 --> 00:28:16,266
just the title, the subtitle as

928
00:28:16,266 --> 00:28:17,116
well as the body of the

929
00:28:17,116 --> 00:28:17,736
notification.

930
00:28:18,366 --> 00:28:19,946
So, in our example here, we

931
00:28:19,946 --> 00:28:21,546
package different information

932
00:28:21,606 --> 00:28:22,686
associated with this

933
00:28:22,686 --> 00:28:24,506
notification such as the user

934
00:28:24,506 --> 00:28:25,666
who posted this video.

935
00:28:26,006 --> 00:28:26,876
The location [inaudible] was

936
00:28:26,876 --> 00:28:28,446
taken as well as a description

937
00:28:28,446 --> 00:28:29,586
that might be associated with

938
00:28:29,586 --> 00:28:29,666
it.

939
00:28:30,046 --> 00:28:31,196
And we can just extract that

940
00:28:31,196 --> 00:28:32,966
simply from the user info

941
00:28:32,966 --> 00:28:33,396
object.

942
00:28:34,936 --> 00:28:36,426
And we use this to set up our

943
00:28:36,426 --> 00:28:38,246
custom labels which, again,

944
00:28:38,246 --> 00:28:39,846
we've tied to the storyboard

945
00:28:39,936 --> 00:28:41,386
associated with our content

946
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:41,786
extension.

947
00:28:41,826 --> 00:28:46,586
So, now that we've set this up

948
00:28:46,586 --> 00:28:48,476
in Code, let's take a look at

949
00:28:48,476 --> 00:28:49,736
how our custom UI looks.

950
00:28:50,526 --> 00:28:52,706
So, the user goes ahead and 3D

951
00:28:52,706 --> 00:28:53,946
touches in this notification.

952
00:28:54,476 --> 00:28:56,046
And then you can see that we

953
00:28:56,046 --> 00:28:57,376
have a completely different UI

954
00:28:57,506 --> 00:28:58,826
here which might be something

955
00:28:58,826 --> 00:29:00,026
similar to what our application

956
00:28:58,826 --> 00:29:00,026
similar to what our application

957
00:29:00,026 --> 00:29:01,006
looks like.

958
00:29:02,276 --> 00:29:03,876
So, we've gone from something

959
00:29:03,876 --> 00:29:06,466
that looked like this to

960
00:29:06,466 --> 00:29:07,486
something that's completely

961
00:29:07,486 --> 00:29:08,126
customized.

962
00:29:08,656 --> 00:29:11,026
You have your own custom title

963
00:29:11,026 --> 00:29:11,756
at the top.

964
00:29:12,276 --> 00:29:14,606
You have your complete custom UI

965
00:29:14,606 --> 00:29:17,776
where the video is surrounded by

966
00:29:17,776 --> 00:29:19,136
all the relevant information

967
00:29:19,136 --> 00:29:20,406
that you want to show as part of

968
00:29:20,406 --> 00:29:21,136
this notification.

969
00:29:21,726 --> 00:29:23,896
And we've hidden the default

970
00:29:23,896 --> 00:29:25,186
content because we've already

971
00:29:25,186 --> 00:29:27,226
included that information in our

972
00:29:27,526 --> 00:29:28,616
custom content.

973
00:29:32,856 --> 00:29:35,086
All right, so let's take a look

974
00:29:35,086 --> 00:29:37,076
at the transition again and pay

975
00:29:37,076 --> 00:29:39,046
attention to the initial sizing

976
00:29:39,046 --> 00:29:40,426
of this content extension as

977
00:29:40,426 --> 00:29:44,436
it's being loaded here.

978
00:29:44,666 --> 00:29:46,076
Now, you might have noticed that

979
00:29:46,206 --> 00:29:47,886
it starts at a larger size and

980
00:29:47,886 --> 00:29:50,386
then grows smaller to the exact

981
00:29:50,386 --> 00:29:51,506
size of the content extension.

982
00:29:51,946 --> 00:29:53,126
Now, this might not be a good

983
00:29:53,126 --> 00:29:54,846
experience for your user if

984
00:29:54,846 --> 00:29:55,806
they're going into your content

985
00:29:55,806 --> 00:29:57,406
extension after 3D touching.

986
00:29:57,956 --> 00:29:59,776
Well, we do have the option of

987
00:29:59,776 --> 00:30:00,966
fixing that as well.

988
00:29:59,776 --> 00:30:00,966
fixing that as well.

989
00:30:01,306 --> 00:30:02,816
And for that, we go back to our

990
00:30:02,816 --> 00:30:03,616
info.plist.

991
00:30:04,146 --> 00:30:06,266
And there we have a property

992
00:30:06,266 --> 00:30:08,266
that you can set which is the

993
00:30:08,266 --> 00:30:09,256
content size ratio.

994
00:30:09,936 --> 00:30:11,856
Now, this ratio is a best guess

995
00:30:12,296 --> 00:30:13,616
that you want to tell the system

996
00:30:13,846 --> 00:30:15,606
for the ratio between the width

997
00:30:15,606 --> 00:30:17,116
and the height of your content

998
00:30:17,116 --> 00:30:17,546
extension.

999
00:30:18,136 --> 00:30:20,036
So, the system knows what's the

1000
00:30:20,036 --> 00:30:21,576
starting size it wants to load

1001
00:30:21,716 --> 00:30:22,786
that content extension at.

1002
00:30:23,706 --> 00:30:24,716
So, in our example here we just

1003
00:30:24,716 --> 00:30:27,966
set the value of 0.8 and once

1004
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:31,336
we've done this, now when we do

1005
00:30:31,336 --> 00:30:33,126
the transition, it loads right

1006
00:30:33,346 --> 00:30:34,756
perfectly to the size of your

1007
00:30:34,756 --> 00:30:35,176
content.

1008
00:30:35,576 --> 00:30:36,446
So, it's a much better

1009
00:30:36,446 --> 00:30:38,266
experience for your users.

1010
00:30:40,096 --> 00:30:41,796
So, before we move on, let's

1011
00:30:41,796 --> 00:30:42,866
take a look at some of the best

1012
00:30:42,866 --> 00:30:44,746
practices for customizing these

1013
00:30:44,746 --> 00:30:45,576
rich notifications.

1014
00:30:47,096 --> 00:30:48,566
Now, as I've emphasized, you can

1015
00:30:48,566 --> 00:30:50,806
have custom UI elements and you

1016
00:30:50,806 --> 00:30:52,086
can display all the relevant

1017
00:30:52,086 --> 00:30:53,546
information using these elements

1018
00:30:53,656 --> 00:30:56,066
as you see fit.

1019
00:30:56,346 --> 00:30:58,016
You can also simply reuse your

1020
00:30:58,016 --> 00:30:59,576
app view controllers in these

1021
00:30:59,576 --> 00:31:01,066
notification content extensions.

1022
00:30:59,576 --> 00:31:01,066
notification content extensions.

1023
00:31:01,396 --> 00:31:02,706
So, you don't have to duplicate

1024
00:31:02,706 --> 00:31:03,196
any work.

1025
00:31:03,576 --> 00:31:04,456
These are simply view

1026
00:31:04,456 --> 00:31:05,016
controllers.

1027
00:31:05,636 --> 00:31:08,556
It's also important to have the

1028
00:31:08,556 --> 00:31:10,876
correct sizing and that the

1029
00:31:10,946 --> 00:31:12,576
starting loading size is also

1030
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:14,096
what makes sense for your

1031
00:31:14,096 --> 00:31:15,056
content, for your custom

1032
00:31:15,056 --> 00:31:15,456
content.

1033
00:31:17,226 --> 00:31:18,706
And lastly, it's important to

1034
00:31:18,706 --> 00:31:20,936
have fast loading and layout for

1035
00:31:20,936 --> 00:31:21,506
your content.

1036
00:31:22,126 --> 00:31:23,386
Because we do want the

1037
00:31:23,386 --> 00:31:25,556
transition from the notification

1038
00:31:25,556 --> 00:31:27,216
into the rich notification to be

1039
00:31:27,216 --> 00:31:28,886
super smooth for your users.

1040
00:31:31,676 --> 00:31:33,776
All right, so this is where we

1041
00:31:33,776 --> 00:31:35,386
ended up with our custom UI.

1042
00:31:36,166 --> 00:31:38,166
Now, we did attach a video here.

1043
00:31:38,376 --> 00:31:40,366
However, there's no way to play

1044
00:31:40,366 --> 00:31:40,856
the media.

1045
00:31:41,806 --> 00:31:43,666
Also, this post looks like it's

1046
00:31:43,666 --> 00:31:44,686
coming from a social media

1047
00:31:44,686 --> 00:31:45,926
stream but there's no way to

1048
00:31:45,926 --> 00:31:46,656
interact with it.

1049
00:31:47,936 --> 00:31:49,576
Well, we can add all these

1050
00:31:49,576 --> 00:31:50,836
different mechanisms to this

1051
00:31:50,836 --> 00:31:52,686
notification and that leads us

1052
00:31:52,686 --> 00:31:54,576
to our last use case about user

1053
00:31:54,576 --> 00:31:55,576
input customization.

1054
00:31:56,166 --> 00:31:58,996
Now, some of you might be

1055
00:31:58,996 --> 00:32:00,666
familiar that the content

1056
00:31:58,996 --> 00:32:00,666
familiar that the content

1057
00:32:00,666 --> 00:32:02,256
extension body does not allow

1058
00:32:02,296 --> 00:32:02,986
any touches.

1059
00:32:03,916 --> 00:32:04,816
However, fear not.

1060
00:32:04,896 --> 00:32:06,686
We do give you some multiple

1061
00:32:07,196 --> 00:32:08,516
input mechanisms that you can

1062
00:32:08,516 --> 00:32:10,246
use here for making these

1063
00:32:10,246 --> 00:32:11,446
notifications interactable.

1064
00:32:12,346 --> 00:32:14,006
And these are namely media

1065
00:32:14,006 --> 00:32:16,386
buttons, notification actions,

1066
00:32:17,096 --> 00:32:18,306
and custom user inputs.

1067
00:32:18,736 --> 00:32:19,826
And we'll take a look at all

1068
00:32:19,826 --> 00:32:20,536
these three different

1069
00:32:20,926 --> 00:32:23,866
interaction models in the

1070
00:32:25,016 --> 00:32:25,226
section.

1071
00:32:25,366 --> 00:32:26,966
Now, wouldn't it be nice that we

1072
00:32:26,966 --> 00:32:28,286
could just overlay our video

1073
00:32:28,286 --> 00:32:30,266
here with a play button on top

1074
00:32:30,266 --> 00:32:30,566
of it?

1075
00:32:31,606 --> 00:32:33,246
Well, you can do that.

1076
00:32:33,246 --> 00:32:35,276
Content extensions allow you to

1077
00:32:35,276 --> 00:32:37,016
overlay your content with media

1078
00:32:37,016 --> 00:32:37,346
buttons.

1079
00:32:37,976 --> 00:32:39,336
Let's take a look how we can set

1080
00:32:39,336 --> 00:32:39,956
this up in code.

1081
00:32:41,606 --> 00:32:43,866
So, here we are back at our, in

1082
00:32:43,866 --> 00:32:45,306
our class which implements the

1083
00:32:45,306 --> 00:32:46,426
content extension protocol.

1084
00:32:47,106 --> 00:32:48,266
And for getting these media

1085
00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:50,226
buttons, you have to implement a

1086
00:32:50,226 --> 00:32:50,786
few methods.

1087
00:32:51,796 --> 00:32:53,576
The first one is the media play

1088
00:32:53,576 --> 00:32:55,556
pause button frame which allows

1089
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:57,066
you to tell the system exactly

1090
00:32:57,066 --> 00:32:58,566
where you want this media button

1091
00:32:58,566 --> 00:33:00,096
to be overlayed over your custom

1092
00:32:58,566 --> 00:33:00,096
to be overlayed over your custom

1093
00:33:00,096 --> 00:33:00,546
content.

1094
00:33:01,916 --> 00:33:03,426
You can also customize the look

1095
00:33:03,426 --> 00:33:05,106
and feel of this media button by

1096
00:33:05,196 --> 00:33:07,396
specifying the color as well as

1097
00:33:07,396 --> 00:33:07,766
the type.

1098
00:33:08,226 --> 00:33:09,426
In this example, we just use

1099
00:33:09,426 --> 00:33:09,776
default.

1100
00:33:10,426 --> 00:33:14,006
Now, to know when the user

1101
00:33:14,006 --> 00:33:15,836
actually pressed the play or the

1102
00:33:15,836 --> 00:33:17,406
pause button, you also get

1103
00:33:17,406 --> 00:33:19,616
method callbacks, namely media

1104
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:20,606
play and media pause.

1105
00:33:20,996 --> 00:33:22,126
And in our example, it's

1106
00:33:22,126 --> 00:33:24,496
important that call to our media

1107
00:33:24,496 --> 00:33:25,796
player in our custom content.

1108
00:33:29,436 --> 00:33:29,976
All right.

1109
00:33:29,976 --> 00:33:31,356
Now that we've set up our media

1110
00:33:31,356 --> 00:33:33,536
button, let's take a look how it

1111
00:33:33,536 --> 00:33:34,156
works in action.

1112
00:33:35,776 --> 00:33:37,716
So, the user goes into our

1113
00:33:37,716 --> 00:33:39,486
custom content and just by

1114
00:33:39,486 --> 00:33:40,656
simply pressing the play button,

1115
00:33:40,916 --> 00:33:41,816
the video starts playing.

1116
00:33:41,926 --> 00:33:46,096
It's as simple as that.

1117
00:33:46,306 --> 00:33:48,116
So, let's move to adding more

1118
00:33:48,116 --> 00:33:48,986
interaction to this

1119
00:33:48,986 --> 00:33:49,576
notification.

1120
00:33:50,306 --> 00:33:51,346
And like I said, this was a

1121
00:33:51,346 --> 00:33:54,256
media post and we want the user

1122
00:33:54,256 --> 00:33:55,996
to give us feedback to this

1123
00:33:55,996 --> 00:33:57,746
video post in the form of, say,

1124
00:33:58,236 --> 00:33:59,946
maybe a like and a comment

1125
00:33:59,946 --> 00:34:00,226
action.

1126
00:33:59,946 --> 00:34:00,226
action.

1127
00:34:01,206 --> 00:34:02,276
So, let's see how we can set

1128
00:34:02,276 --> 00:34:02,966
these up.

1129
00:34:04,016 --> 00:34:05,786
Now, normally action handling

1130
00:34:05,786 --> 00:34:07,306
works that when the user takes

1131
00:34:07,306 --> 00:34:09,025
an action, you get the response

1132
00:34:09,096 --> 00:34:10,136
in your main application.

1133
00:34:11,025 --> 00:34:12,166
However, if you do have a

1134
00:34:12,166 --> 00:34:14,476
content extension set up, you do

1135
00:34:14,476 --> 00:34:16,166
have the option of intercepting

1136
00:34:16,166 --> 00:34:17,666
this action right in the content

1137
00:34:17,666 --> 00:34:18,065
extension.

1138
00:34:18,126 --> 00:34:20,466
So, you can act on this action

1139
00:34:20,466 --> 00:34:22,255
as well as update your UI the

1140
00:34:22,255 --> 00:34:23,466
way you want to do it.

1141
00:34:24,266 --> 00:34:25,416
Also, you have the option of

1142
00:34:25,416 --> 00:34:26,946
just forwarding this action to

1143
00:34:26,946 --> 00:34:28,456
the application if you want to

1144
00:34:28,456 --> 00:34:29,596
centralize all your action

1145
00:34:29,596 --> 00:34:29,926
handling.

1146
00:34:30,525 --> 00:34:32,846
Let's see how we can set this

1147
00:34:32,846 --> 00:34:33,436
all up in code.

1148
00:34:35,056 --> 00:34:36,516
So, here we create our two

1149
00:34:36,795 --> 00:34:38,466
actions, one for like which is a

1150
00:34:38,466 --> 00:34:39,946
simple UN notification action.

1151
00:34:40,876 --> 00:34:42,235
And for comment action, we

1152
00:34:42,235 --> 00:34:43,976
create a text input action.

1153
00:34:44,606 --> 00:34:46,985
And then we set up our category

1154
00:34:46,985 --> 00:34:47,926
with these two actions that

1155
00:34:47,966 --> 00:34:50,536
we've created, giving it the

1156
00:34:50,536 --> 00:34:52,025
same identifier that's

1157
00:34:52,025 --> 00:34:53,306
associated with the content

1158
00:34:53,306 --> 00:34:53,806
extension.

1159
00:34:54,016 --> 00:34:57,636
Now, when we come back to the

1160
00:34:57,636 --> 00:34:59,756
content extension code, the main

1161
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:01,186
method that you implement for

1162
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:01,186
method that you implement for

1163
00:35:01,186 --> 00:35:02,846
handling these actions is the

1164
00:35:03,196 --> 00:35:04,416
did receive response with

1165
00:35:04,456 --> 00:35:05,406
completion handler method.

1166
00:35:06,266 --> 00:35:07,486
Now, here the UN notification

1167
00:35:07,486 --> 00:35:09,336
response object contains all the

1168
00:35:09,336 --> 00:35:10,966
information about the action

1169
00:35:10,966 --> 00:35:12,556
that was taken as well as the

1170
00:35:12,556 --> 00:35:14,076
notification request on which

1171
00:35:14,076 --> 00:35:14,936
this action was taken.

1172
00:35:15,526 --> 00:35:17,766
So, the first thing in our

1173
00:35:17,766 --> 00:35:19,616
example that we do here is post

1174
00:35:19,616 --> 00:35:20,906
this response to our server

1175
00:35:21,236 --> 00:35:22,876
because we just want to handle

1176
00:35:22,876 --> 00:35:23,976
our action in the content

1177
00:35:23,976 --> 00:35:25,376
extension without sending it to

1178
00:35:25,376 --> 00:35:26,246
our app.

1179
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:28,656
Then we look at the action

1180
00:35:28,656 --> 00:35:29,816
identifier and determine it's

1181
00:35:29,816 --> 00:35:30,496
the like action.

1182
00:35:31,466 --> 00:35:32,906
And then just go ahead and

1183
00:35:32,906 --> 00:35:34,786
update our custom UI with the

1184
00:35:34,876 --> 00:35:35,546
like emoji.

1185
00:35:36,086 --> 00:35:38,206
And lastly, we call the

1186
00:35:38,206 --> 00:35:39,566
completion handler with the

1187
00:35:39,566 --> 00:35:40,706
option do not dismiss.

1188
00:35:41,276 --> 00:35:42,706
Because we want the user to

1189
00:35:42,706 --> 00:35:44,496
still interact with the content,

1190
00:35:44,496 --> 00:35:45,746
because the video might still be

1191
00:35:45,746 --> 00:35:47,066
playing after they've completed

1192
00:35:47,066 --> 00:35:47,526
this action.

1193
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:51,836
So, once we've set this action

1194
00:35:51,836 --> 00:35:53,416
up, let's take a look at how

1195
00:35:53,416 --> 00:35:53,846
this looks.

1196
00:35:54,606 --> 00:35:58,606
So, the user starts playing the

1197
00:35:58,606 --> 00:35:59,986
video and just by simply taking

1198
00:35:59,986 --> 00:36:01,736
the like action, we've updated

1199
00:35:59,986 --> 00:36:01,736
the like action, we've updated

1200
00:36:01,736 --> 00:36:03,616
the UI and it gives a good

1201
00:36:03,616 --> 00:36:05,086
feedback to the user that

1202
00:36:05,086 --> 00:36:06,116
they're engaging with this

1203
00:36:06,116 --> 00:36:07,306
content right there and then.

1204
00:36:07,686 --> 00:36:08,796
And the video's still playing

1205
00:36:08,876 --> 00:36:09,716
and the content hasn't

1206
00:36:09,716 --> 00:36:10,166
dismissed.

1207
00:36:10,616 --> 00:36:13,826
Let's continue and look at the

1208
00:36:13,826 --> 00:36:14,946
next action that we've added

1209
00:36:15,016 --> 00:36:16,016
which was the comment action.

1210
00:36:16,576 --> 00:36:17,626
And here again we look at the

1211
00:36:17,626 --> 00:36:19,306
action identifier and determine

1212
00:36:19,386 --> 00:36:20,546
that it is the comment action.

1213
00:36:21,556 --> 00:36:23,266
Now, since we know that we'd set

1214
00:36:23,266 --> 00:36:25,166
it up as a text input action, we

1215
00:36:25,166 --> 00:36:26,576
first check if the response is

1216
00:36:26,576 --> 00:36:27,976
associated with a text response.

1217
00:36:29,476 --> 00:36:31,526
And we extract the user text

1218
00:36:31,526 --> 00:36:32,516
that the user might have entered

1219
00:36:32,606 --> 00:36:33,556
as part of this action.

1220
00:36:34,296 --> 00:36:36,146
And then set it up on our custom

1221
00:36:36,146 --> 00:36:37,796
label that's again associated

1222
00:36:37,796 --> 00:36:38,526
with our custom UI.

1223
00:36:38,526 --> 00:36:40,726
And again, we call the

1224
00:36:40,726 --> 00:36:41,946
completion handler without

1225
00:36:41,946 --> 00:36:43,136
dismissing this notification.

1226
00:36:45,296 --> 00:36:47,146
So, once we've set this up

1227
00:36:47,986 --> 00:36:50,086
again, now the user starts

1228
00:36:50,086 --> 00:36:51,006
playing the video, presses the

1229
00:36:51,006 --> 00:36:53,006
comment button and just adds

1230
00:36:53,006 --> 00:36:54,026
their comment there.

1231
00:36:54,326 --> 00:36:55,456
And as soon as you post it, we

1232
00:36:55,456 --> 00:36:57,006
just update our content right

1233
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:57,526
there and then.

1234
00:36:58,696 --> 00:37:00,306
So, it's, so the user gets

1235
00:36:58,696 --> 00:37:00,306
So, it's, so the user gets

1236
00:37:00,306 --> 00:37:01,436
real-time feedback of what

1237
00:37:01,436 --> 00:37:02,846
they're doing and they're super

1238
00:37:02,846 --> 00:37:04,566
engaged with the content that's

1239
00:37:04,566 --> 00:37:05,216
associated with the

1240
00:37:05,216 --> 00:37:05,886
notification.

1241
00:37:06,386 --> 00:37:07,236
And they don't have to go to

1242
00:37:07,236 --> 00:37:09,506
your application to do all these

1243
00:37:12,276 --> 00:37:12,406
things.

1244
00:37:12,596 --> 00:37:15,006
All right, so we've set up these

1245
00:37:15,006 --> 00:37:18,006
two actions but sometimes a like

1246
00:37:18,326 --> 00:37:19,666
is not enough and a comment

1247
00:37:19,666 --> 00:37:20,486
might be too much.

1248
00:37:21,756 --> 00:37:23,716
For social media posts maybe, we

1249
00:37:23,716 --> 00:37:25,476
want to have the user to give

1250
00:37:25,476 --> 00:37:26,936
their reactions to this post.

1251
00:37:27,736 --> 00:37:29,496
So, one way we could do that is

1252
00:37:29,806 --> 00:37:30,966
add all these different

1253
00:37:30,966 --> 00:37:33,406
reactions as just actions

1254
00:37:33,406 --> 00:37:34,156
associated with this

1255
00:37:34,156 --> 00:37:34,726
notification.

1256
00:37:35,386 --> 00:37:36,506
However, this doesn't look

1257
00:37:36,506 --> 00:37:37,836
really nice and it's a lot of

1258
00:37:37,836 --> 00:37:39,426
options that we're duplicating

1259
00:37:39,426 --> 00:37:39,556
here.

1260
00:37:40,876 --> 00:37:42,206
What if you could just replace

1261
00:37:42,206 --> 00:37:44,256
this with a custom user input

1262
00:37:44,296 --> 00:37:44,506
view?

1263
00:37:45,026 --> 00:37:46,496
That shows up right where the

1264
00:37:46,496 --> 00:37:48,336
user's keyboard would've gone.

1265
00:37:49,056 --> 00:37:50,626
Perhaps something like this?

1266
00:37:51,986 --> 00:37:53,796
Well, you do have the option of

1267
00:37:53,866 --> 00:37:54,426
doing this.

1268
00:37:54,806 --> 00:37:56,436
And for that, we use an existing

1269
00:37:56,436 --> 00:37:58,536
UI kit API for UI responder.

1270
00:38:00,046 --> 00:38:01,056
And let's take a look how we can

1271
00:38:01,056 --> 00:38:02,116
set this up and code them.

1272
00:38:03,256 --> 00:38:05,046
So, now we create our new action

1273
00:38:05,766 --> 00:38:07,116
for reactions which is a simple

1274
00:38:07,116 --> 00:38:08,126
UN notification action.

1275
00:38:08,686 --> 00:38:09,906
And then update our category

1276
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:12,326
with this action that we've

1277
00:38:14,936 --> 00:38:15,146
created.

1278
00:38:15,246 --> 00:38:18,596
Now, in the class that's

1279
00:38:18,596 --> 00:38:19,476
implementing the content

1280
00:38:19,476 --> 00:38:20,996
extension protocol, what you

1281
00:38:20,996 --> 00:38:22,146
need to do is override a few

1282
00:38:22,146 --> 00:38:23,706
methods that tell the system

1283
00:38:23,996 --> 00:38:25,326
that you're providing your own

1284
00:38:25,326 --> 00:38:26,176
custom input feed.

1285
00:38:26,576 --> 00:38:28,136
The first method that you have

1286
00:38:28,136 --> 00:38:29,446
to override is the can become

1287
00:38:29,446 --> 00:38:31,026
first responder and you return

1288
00:38:31,026 --> 00:38:31,676
the value true.

1289
00:38:32,866 --> 00:38:34,516
And then you override the input

1290
00:38:34,516 --> 00:38:35,536
view method where you're

1291
00:38:35,536 --> 00:38:36,896
returning your custom input

1292
00:38:36,896 --> 00:38:37,146
field.

1293
00:38:38,036 --> 00:38:39,966
Now, you have complete control

1294
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:41,216
of how you're setting this input

1295
00:38:41,216 --> 00:38:41,986
view up.

1296
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:44,376
And all the actions and the

1297
00:38:44,376 --> 00:38:46,226
different interactions that you

1298
00:38:46,226 --> 00:38:47,456
might have associated with this.

1299
00:38:47,456 --> 00:38:48,376
You're not going to go through

1300
00:38:48,376 --> 00:38:50,436
the default notification action

1301
00:38:50,436 --> 00:38:51,936
handling for this because this

1302
00:38:51,936 --> 00:38:56,636
is your custom input view.

1303
00:38:56,846 --> 00:38:58,666
So, once we've set this up, we

1304
00:38:58,666 --> 00:39:00,506
come back to the did receive

1305
00:38:58,666 --> 00:39:00,506
come back to the did receive

1306
00:39:00,506 --> 00:39:02,736
action response method and here

1307
00:39:02,736 --> 00:39:04,256
determining that it's the action

1308
00:39:04,256 --> 00:39:05,916
associated with the reaction

1309
00:39:07,016 --> 00:39:07,856
[inaudible], all we have to do

1310
00:39:07,956 --> 00:39:09,866
is call self.become first

1311
00:39:09,866 --> 00:39:10,236
responder.

1312
00:39:11,166 --> 00:39:13,056
Just simply this call will let

1313
00:39:13,056 --> 00:39:14,616
the system know to display your

1314
00:39:14,616 --> 00:39:16,056
custom input view where the

1315
00:39:16,056 --> 00:39:16,836
keyword would've gone.

1316
00:39:18,266 --> 00:39:19,646
And in our private method for

1317
00:39:19,736 --> 00:39:21,836
handling the bottom press for

1318
00:39:21,836 --> 00:39:23,426
these, we update our custom

1319
00:39:23,426 --> 00:39:25,826
label and also we just call

1320
00:39:25,826 --> 00:39:27,616
resign first responder which

1321
00:39:27,686 --> 00:39:29,846
then dismisses your custom input

1322
00:39:30,626 --> 00:39:30,736
view.

1323
00:39:30,956 --> 00:39:33,136
Now, I know that's a lot of

1324
00:39:33,136 --> 00:39:33,366
code.

1325
00:39:33,366 --> 00:39:34,306
Let's take a look how this

1326
00:39:34,306 --> 00:39:34,956
actually works.

1327
00:39:36,086 --> 00:39:37,566
So, you can see here that we

1328
00:39:37,566 --> 00:39:38,896
have our new action for

1329
00:39:39,006 --> 00:39:39,536
reactions.

1330
00:39:40,106 --> 00:39:43,746
And then when the user presses

1331
00:39:43,776 --> 00:39:45,346
this, our custom input view just

1332
00:39:45,346 --> 00:39:47,576
shows up at the button and by

1333
00:39:47,576 --> 00:39:48,916
pressing either of these emojis,

1334
00:39:49,186 --> 00:39:50,606
we can just update the UI there.

1335
00:39:51,286 --> 00:39:55,116
So, it's a very customized way

1336
00:39:55,236 --> 00:39:56,796
of how you want your users to

1337
00:39:56,796 --> 00:39:57,936
interact with your content.

1338
00:39:58,236 --> 00:40:00,256
You're not limited by just

1339
00:39:58,236 --> 00:40:00,256
You're not limited by just

1340
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:02,226
simple action button presses.

1341
00:40:02,796 --> 00:40:04,136
So, we've gone from something

1342
00:40:04,136 --> 00:40:06,586
that looked like this.

1343
00:40:06,796 --> 00:40:07,856
To something that's much more

1344
00:40:07,856 --> 00:40:09,556
concise and a much better user

1345
00:40:09,556 --> 00:40:10,096
experience.

1346
00:40:10,096 --> 00:40:14,506
So, what are some of the best

1347
00:40:14,506 --> 00:40:16,066
practices for this user input

1348
00:40:16,066 --> 00:40:16,756
customization?

1349
00:40:16,826 --> 00:40:19,796
Now, let me repeat that media

1350
00:40:19,796 --> 00:40:21,456
buttons are the only mechanism

1351
00:40:21,456 --> 00:40:22,406
that you have for overlay

1352
00:40:22,406 --> 00:40:22,826
controls.

1353
00:40:22,826 --> 00:40:23,996
So, use them where it makes

1354
00:40:23,996 --> 00:40:24,346
sense.

1355
00:40:25,016 --> 00:40:26,056
You can associate them with

1356
00:40:26,116 --> 00:40:27,506
video as well as some playback.

1357
00:40:28,146 --> 00:40:30,476
Make sure your actions are

1358
00:40:30,476 --> 00:40:31,896
specific to the context of the

1359
00:40:31,896 --> 00:40:33,746
notification so that the user

1360
00:40:33,746 --> 00:40:35,356
knows exactly what they're doing

1361
00:40:35,356 --> 00:40:36,076
with these actions.

1362
00:40:36,076 --> 00:40:39,426
It's up to you to determine

1363
00:40:39,486 --> 00:40:40,336
whether it makes sense to

1364
00:40:40,336 --> 00:40:42,376
dismiss the content extension or

1365
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:43,616
not depending upon the kind of

1366
00:40:43,616 --> 00:40:44,346
engagement that you're

1367
00:40:44,346 --> 00:40:45,586
presenting as part of your

1368
00:40:45,586 --> 00:40:46,066
notification.

1369
00:40:46,626 --> 00:40:49,476
And then the custom user input

1370
00:40:49,476 --> 00:40:50,976
view gives you complete control

1371
00:40:51,446 --> 00:40:53,856
of your input mechanisms for

1372
00:40:53,856 --> 00:40:54,806
these notifications.

1373
00:40:55,386 --> 00:40:58,666
Now, before we go today, we did

1374
00:40:58,786 --> 00:41:01,096
want to showcase a few apps that

1375
00:40:58,786 --> 00:41:01,096
want to showcase a few apps that

1376
00:41:01,096 --> 00:41:02,916
we feel have really used these

1377
00:41:02,916 --> 00:41:04,656
notifications APIs.

1378
00:41:04,656 --> 00:41:05,756
Most of them that we announced

1379
00:41:05,756 --> 00:41:08,496
at last year's WWDC and show how

1380
00:41:08,496 --> 00:41:09,476
they're using these different

1381
00:41:09,476 --> 00:41:10,616
APIs in different ways.

1382
00:41:12,146 --> 00:41:13,726
The [inaudible] application

1383
00:41:14,136 --> 00:41:15,906
provides a very rich interface

1384
00:41:15,906 --> 00:41:18,586
with the media as well as the

1385
00:41:18,806 --> 00:41:21,266
news title and a blurb about

1386
00:41:21,266 --> 00:41:22,506
this content right there and

1387
00:41:22,506 --> 00:41:22,746
then.

1388
00:41:22,846 --> 00:41:24,176
And gives you the option of just

1389
00:41:24,176 --> 00:41:25,296
interacting with this content

1390
00:41:25,386 --> 00:41:25,996
with actions.

1391
00:41:26,536 --> 00:41:30,126
The Castro Podcast app shows you

1392
00:41:30,126 --> 00:41:32,216
your next upcoming podcast as

1393
00:41:32,216 --> 00:41:33,506
well as gives you the option of

1394
00:41:33,506 --> 00:41:35,036
just modifying your podcast

1395
00:41:35,036 --> 00:41:36,396
queue list right there and then,

1396
00:41:36,566 --> 00:41:38,006
again with notification actions.

1397
00:41:38,576 --> 00:41:41,216
And then the Shazam content

1398
00:41:41,216 --> 00:41:42,736
extension gives you a play

1399
00:41:42,736 --> 00:41:44,066
button so that you can play your

1400
00:41:44,066 --> 00:41:45,676
last recorded song right from

1401
00:41:45,676 --> 00:41:47,206
the notification as well as the

1402
00:41:47,206 --> 00:41:49,306
option to buy and share this

1403
00:41:49,306 --> 00:41:49,556
media.

1404
00:41:49,976 --> 00:41:53,956
All right, so let's summarize

1405
00:41:53,956 --> 00:41:55,166
everything that we've looked in

1406
00:41:55,166 --> 00:41:55,786
our session today.

1407
00:41:56,826 --> 00:41:58,246
We started out by doing an

1408
00:41:58,246 --> 00:42:00,036
overview of notifications and

1409
00:41:58,246 --> 00:42:00,036
overview of notifications and

1410
00:42:00,036 --> 00:42:01,406
all the different APIs that you

1411
00:42:01,406 --> 00:42:03,176
can use for doing notifications

1412
00:42:03,176 --> 00:42:04,086
for your applications.

1413
00:42:05,296 --> 00:42:06,556
Then we introduced a new concept

1414
00:42:06,556 --> 00:42:07,726
about hidden notification

1415
00:42:07,726 --> 00:42:09,966
content and how you can totally

1416
00:42:09,966 --> 00:42:11,996
customize how that looks to your

1417
00:42:11,996 --> 00:42:12,896
application users.

1418
00:42:13,476 --> 00:42:16,106
Then we talked about modifying

1419
00:42:16,106 --> 00:42:17,956
notification push content using

1420
00:42:17,956 --> 00:42:18,826
service extension.

1421
00:42:19,466 --> 00:42:22,106
And we talked about customizing

1422
00:42:22,106 --> 00:42:23,456
rich notification interfaces

1423
00:42:23,576 --> 00:42:24,976
using content extensions.

1424
00:42:26,286 --> 00:42:27,616
And tied to that, we talked

1425
00:42:27,616 --> 00:42:29,406
about customizing these user

1426
00:42:29,406 --> 00:42:30,896
input that's associated with

1427
00:42:30,896 --> 00:42:31,986
these rich notifications.

1428
00:42:32,886 --> 00:42:34,046
So, we're really excited to see

1429
00:42:34,266 --> 00:42:36,106
how you go ahead and use all

1430
00:42:36,106 --> 00:42:37,836
these different tools for making

1431
00:42:37,836 --> 00:42:39,376
the notification experience much

1432
00:42:39,376 --> 00:42:40,656
richer for your application

1433
00:42:40,656 --> 00:42:41,066
users.

1434
00:42:42,346 --> 00:42:43,356
For more information about this

1435
00:42:43,356 --> 00:42:44,596
session, do check out this

1436
00:42:44,596 --> 00:42:44,926
website.

1437
00:42:46,456 --> 00:42:47,666
That's all for the session

1438
00:42:47,666 --> 00:42:47,946
today.

1439
00:42:48,066 --> 00:42:49,086
Thank you so much for coming and

1440
00:42:49,496 --> 00:42:50,646
have a great WWDC.
