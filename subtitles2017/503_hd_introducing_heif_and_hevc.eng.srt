[ Crowd Sounds ]

2
00:00:25,796 --> 00:00:27,616
&gt;&gt; Welcome everyone and thank

3
00:00:27,616 --> 00:00:29,046
you for coming to this session.

4
00:00:29,996 --> 00:00:31,276
My name is Athar Shah.

5
00:00:31,276 --> 00:00:33,016
And I'm a manager here at Apple

6
00:00:33,016 --> 00:00:34,356
in the core media software team.

7
00:00:34,356 --> 00:00:36,336
And we at Apple are really

8
00:00:36,336 --> 00:00:37,756
excited to talk to you today

9
00:00:37,756 --> 00:00:39,456
about two new media

10
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:40,216
technologies.

11
00:00:41,226 --> 00:00:42,386
In particular, we're going to be

12
00:00:42,386 --> 00:00:44,816
talking about a new codec for

13
00:00:44,816 --> 00:00:46,266
video and image compression

14
00:00:46,826 --> 00:00:50,076
called HEVC and a file format

15
00:00:50,076 --> 00:00:51,646
for images that we're adopting

16
00:00:52,186 --> 00:00:52,866
called HEIF.

17
00:00:54,206 --> 00:00:55,276
But before we get into the

18
00:00:55,276 --> 00:00:57,566
details, if you've downloaded

19
00:00:57,806 --> 00:00:59,666
the developer seed, the latest

20
00:00:59,696 --> 00:01:01,566
build, then on certain iOS

21
00:00:59,696 --> 00:01:01,566
build, then on certain iOS

22
00:01:01,606 --> 00:01:03,956
devices you are already

23
00:01:03,956 --> 00:01:06,226
capturing and using these new

24
00:01:06,226 --> 00:01:08,056
technologies and file formats.

25
00:01:08,836 --> 00:01:10,356
And if you pay close attention,

26
00:01:10,356 --> 00:01:13,036
you'll notice that these files

27
00:01:13,036 --> 00:01:15,036
are a lot smaller than they used

28
00:01:15,036 --> 00:01:15,916
to be.

29
00:01:16,026 --> 00:01:17,596
Later on in the presentation,

30
00:01:17,596 --> 00:01:18,886
Gavin will talk to you about the

31
00:01:18,886 --> 00:01:22,406
specifics of our platforms and

32
00:01:22,406 --> 00:01:23,916
how we support these

33
00:01:23,916 --> 00:01:25,636
technologies in hardware and in

34
00:01:25,636 --> 00:01:26,196
software.

35
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:32,106
So we're going to be going over

36
00:01:32,976 --> 00:01:34,516
the landscape of media as it is

37
00:01:34,576 --> 00:01:36,406
today, why we need to change.

38
00:01:36,896 --> 00:01:38,956
We'll talk about what are HEVC

39
00:01:38,956 --> 00:01:41,716
and HEIF and why we decided to

40
00:01:41,716 --> 00:01:43,036
adopt them here at Apple.

41
00:01:43,476 --> 00:01:45,676
And then finally, we'll give an

42
00:01:45,676 --> 00:01:48,506
overview of how we've adopted

43
00:01:48,506 --> 00:01:49,696
these technologies within the

44
00:01:49,696 --> 00:01:52,216
Apple ecosystem and then also

45
00:01:52,396 --> 00:01:54,006
provide some guidance on how you

46
00:01:54,006 --> 00:01:55,286
can take advantage of these

47
00:01:55,366 --> 00:01:57,176
within your apps for your use

48
00:01:57,176 --> 00:01:57,556
cases.

49
00:02:01,236 --> 00:02:03,356
So let's talk about media today.

50
00:02:04,046 --> 00:02:06,546
The world is becoming more and

51
00:02:06,546 --> 00:02:07,396
more visual.

52
00:02:07,846 --> 00:02:10,406
And both consumers and producers

53
00:02:10,586 --> 00:02:12,836
are generating more and more

54
00:02:13,336 --> 00:02:15,116
video and media related content.

55
00:02:15,996 --> 00:02:17,966
Not only that, the content is

56
00:02:18,026 --> 00:02:20,176
taking new forms like high

57
00:02:20,176 --> 00:02:23,926
resolution 4K video, HDR video,

58
00:02:24,246 --> 00:02:26,346
wide color or wide gamut video

59
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:26,936
and so on.

60
00:02:28,336 --> 00:02:29,686
The nature of media is also

61
00:02:29,686 --> 00:02:32,966
changing with, you know, our

62
00:02:32,966 --> 00:02:34,096
personal favorite being live

63
00:02:34,096 --> 00:02:35,396
photos but there's lots of

64
00:02:35,396 --> 00:02:36,806
content out there, short-form

65
00:02:36,806 --> 00:02:38,436
video and so one.

66
00:02:39,436 --> 00:02:41,156
Bandwidth continues to be at a

67
00:02:41,156 --> 00:02:41,786
premium.

68
00:02:42,046 --> 00:02:43,836
And certain applications and use

69
00:02:43,876 --> 00:02:45,726
cases like over-the-top video

70
00:02:45,726 --> 00:02:48,146
delivery and wireless networks

71
00:02:49,016 --> 00:02:50,556
place a premium on the amount of

72
00:02:50,556 --> 00:02:51,106
bandwidth.

73
00:02:51,106 --> 00:02:53,016
And anything we can do to reduce

74
00:02:53,016 --> 00:02:54,086
the bandwidth requirements

75
00:02:54,086 --> 00:02:55,236
really helps out those use

76
00:02:55,236 --> 00:02:55,726
cases.

77
00:02:57,166 --> 00:03:00,236
So we've been using H.264 and

78
00:02:57,166 --> 00:03:00,236
So we've been using H.264 and

79
00:03:00,236 --> 00:03:01,506
JPEG for a while.

80
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:03,406
There are limits to what these

81
00:03:03,506 --> 00:03:06,246
codecs can do in this evolving

82
00:03:06,246 --> 00:03:07,376
landscape with these new

83
00:03:07,376 --> 00:03:08,086
challenges.

84
00:03:08,596 --> 00:03:11,156
And that leads us to HEVC.

85
00:03:12,006 --> 00:03:13,016
We were looking for a

86
00:03:13,016 --> 00:03:15,146
next-generation codec that we

87
00:03:15,146 --> 00:03:18,076
could use both for movies and

88
00:03:18,076 --> 00:03:19,396
for photos or images.

89
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:20,926
And we were looking for

90
00:03:20,926 --> 00:03:22,056
something that was going to give

91
00:03:22,056 --> 00:03:24,476
us significant benefits over

92
00:03:24,476 --> 00:03:27,826
what exists today.

93
00:03:27,986 --> 00:03:30,896
So having evaluated our options,

94
00:03:31,016 --> 00:03:32,986
we decided to select HEVC.

95
00:03:32,986 --> 00:03:36,956
HEVC stands for High Efficiency

96
00:03:36,956 --> 00:03:37,756
Video Coding.

97
00:03:38,376 --> 00:03:39,626
It is a state-of-the-art

98
00:03:40,326 --> 00:03:41,846
industry standard that was

99
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:43,986
adopted and approved in 2013.

100
00:03:45,056 --> 00:03:48,046
It was ratified by ISO as MPEG-H

101
00:03:48,046 --> 00:03:52,556
part 2 and by ITU as H.265.

102
00:03:53,676 --> 00:03:55,026
We're going to be calling it and

103
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:57,266
referring to it as HEVC.

104
00:03:57,336 --> 00:04:00,296
And Apple is adopting it as its

105
00:03:57,336 --> 00:04:00,296
And Apple is adopting it as its

106
00:04:00,296 --> 00:04:02,406
next-generation codec.

107
00:04:03,736 --> 00:04:05,146
So we'll spend a couple of

108
00:04:05,146 --> 00:04:07,496
minutes talking about what makes

109
00:04:07,496 --> 00:04:09,356
HEVC such a great codec.

110
00:04:09,506 --> 00:04:13,376
Now HEVC is similar to H.264 in

111
00:04:13,376 --> 00:04:14,886
that it is a codec that

112
00:04:15,116 --> 00:04:18,536
processes videos and frames in

113
00:04:18,536 --> 00:04:19,146
blocks.

114
00:04:19,976 --> 00:04:22,976
And it uses temporal and spatial

115
00:04:22,976 --> 00:04:24,826
compression techniques to get

116
00:04:24,826 --> 00:04:26,006
the compression benefits.

117
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:29,596
Now H.264 has a notion of macro

118
00:04:29,596 --> 00:04:32,696
blocks, which are 16 x 16 size

119
00:04:32,696 --> 00:04:34,576
blocks that are used within the

120
00:04:34,576 --> 00:04:36,046
codec for processing.

121
00:04:36,746 --> 00:04:40,396
HEVC introduces notion of CTUs

122
00:04:40,396 --> 00:04:41,486
or coding tree units.

123
00:04:41,926 --> 00:04:43,736
And these it start down at 4 x 4

124
00:04:44,396 --> 00:04:48,116
and go all the way up to 64 x

125
00:04:48,116 --> 00:04:48,756
64.

126
00:04:49,716 --> 00:04:51,646
And it's when you can use these

127
00:04:51,766 --> 00:04:54,996
larger sizes is when you realize

128
00:04:55,056 --> 00:04:56,346
the greater compression benefit.

129
00:04:57,446 --> 00:04:59,936
And this is especially true when

130
00:04:59,936 --> 00:05:00,956
you're dealing with high

131
00:04:59,936 --> 00:05:00,956
you're dealing with high

132
00:05:00,956 --> 00:05:03,826
resolution videos and images.

133
00:05:03,826 --> 00:05:05,196
You can really take advantage of

134
00:05:05,846 --> 00:05:05,966
this.

135
00:05:07,116 --> 00:05:10,636
Similarly, H.264 had 4 x 4 and 8

136
00:05:10,636 --> 00:05:13,736
x 8 DCT or discrete cosine

137
00:05:13,736 --> 00:05:18,476
transform, whereas HEVC not only

138
00:05:18,476 --> 00:05:19,806
uses a discrete cosine

139
00:05:19,806 --> 00:05:21,486
transform, it also uses a DST,

140
00:05:21,486 --> 00:05:23,066
distribute sine transform.

141
00:05:23,576 --> 00:05:25,076
And similarly, with the coding

142
00:05:25,076 --> 00:05:27,276
block sizes for the transform

143
00:05:27,276 --> 00:05:30,226
blocks, it also goes up to 32 x

144
00:05:30,226 --> 00:05:30,736
32.

145
00:05:32,436 --> 00:05:34,096
To get better spatial

146
00:05:34,096 --> 00:05:36,696
compression, HEVC introduces

147
00:05:36,696 --> 00:05:38,256
additional directional modes.

148
00:05:38,256 --> 00:05:41,456
While H.264 had up to nine, HEVC

149
00:05:41,456 --> 00:05:43,346
has up to 35.

150
00:05:45,456 --> 00:05:48,316
A key part of being able to do a

151
00:05:48,506 --> 00:05:49,866
high degree of compression

152
00:05:49,866 --> 00:05:51,526
involves motion estimation or

153
00:05:51,526 --> 00:05:53,126
motion compensation.

154
00:05:53,866 --> 00:05:56,616
And this is where you try to

155
00:05:56,616 --> 00:05:58,756
find -- you basically have a

156
00:05:58,756 --> 00:06:01,136
block in your current image that

157
00:05:58,756 --> 00:06:01,136
block in your current image that

158
00:06:01,136 --> 00:06:02,896
you're trying to predict from a

159
00:06:02,956 --> 00:06:03,926
previous image.

160
00:06:03,926 --> 00:06:05,086
And what you can do is say, you

161
00:06:05,086 --> 00:06:05,426
know what?

162
00:06:05,786 --> 00:06:07,756
This block is that same block

163
00:06:07,756 --> 00:06:09,376
from the past but moved over by

164
00:06:09,376 --> 00:06:10,576
a certain number of pixels.

165
00:06:11,566 --> 00:06:14,906
Sometimes you don't always land

166
00:06:14,906 --> 00:06:15,836
in a pixel's boundary.

167
00:06:15,836 --> 00:06:17,046
For example, you know, something

168
00:06:17,046 --> 00:06:18,236
could have moved five pixels

169
00:06:18,236 --> 00:06:18,996
over but it could have moved

170
00:06:19,036 --> 00:06:20,436
five-and-a-half pixels over or

171
00:06:20,436 --> 00:06:21,906
five-and-a-quarter pixels over.

172
00:06:22,976 --> 00:06:23,986
When you need to do motion

173
00:06:23,986 --> 00:06:26,266
estimation at that half pixel or

174
00:06:26,266 --> 00:06:28,206
quarter pixel boundary, you need

175
00:06:28,206 --> 00:06:29,356
to be able to generate those

176
00:06:29,356 --> 00:06:30,686
pixels with accuracy and

177
00:06:30,686 --> 00:06:32,216
precision because those don't

178
00:06:32,216 --> 00:06:32,566
exist.

179
00:06:32,566 --> 00:06:33,586
You just have to pixels at the

180
00:06:33,586 --> 00:06:34,206
boundaries.

181
00:06:34,756 --> 00:06:37,616
And so as you can see, HEVC has

182
00:06:37,616 --> 00:06:40,306
advanced filtering which can be

183
00:06:40,306 --> 00:06:42,756
used to generate those sub-pel

184
00:06:42,756 --> 00:06:44,806
and quarter-pel pixels with much

185
00:06:44,806 --> 00:06:46,226
more accuracy and precision.

186
00:06:46,496 --> 00:06:47,646
And that leads to better motion

187
00:06:47,646 --> 00:06:49,566
estimation compensation and,

188
00:06:49,566 --> 00:06:51,646
hence, better compression.

189
00:06:52,806 --> 00:06:54,456
Finally, if you're familiar with

190
00:06:54,816 --> 00:06:56,796
block-based codecs, we talked

191
00:06:56,796 --> 00:06:59,656
about H.264 having macro blocks,

192
00:07:00,046 --> 00:07:01,576
sometimes you can actually see

193
00:07:01,576 --> 00:07:04,486
in the coded video, artifacts

194
00:07:04,486 --> 00:07:06,646
around the edges of that block.

195
00:07:06,646 --> 00:07:07,456
We call those blocking

196
00:07:07,456 --> 00:07:07,966
artifacts.

197
00:07:07,966 --> 00:07:12,136
H.264 introduced a loop filter

198
00:07:12,576 --> 00:07:14,986
called the deblocking filter

199
00:07:15,316 --> 00:07:16,666
that helps get rid of a lot of

200
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:17,606
those artifacts.

201
00:07:18,036 --> 00:07:19,676
Now HEVC improves upon that

202
00:07:19,736 --> 00:07:21,916
filter, but it takes it a step

203
00:07:21,976 --> 00:07:23,546
further and introduces a second

204
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:25,746
sequential step where we run a

205
00:07:25,796 --> 00:07:27,636
sample adaptive offset filter

206
00:07:27,886 --> 00:07:28,866
which gives us even better

207
00:07:28,866 --> 00:07:29,376
results.

208
00:07:29,936 --> 00:07:30,856
So now these are some of the

209
00:07:30,856 --> 00:07:32,926
highlights that give us a better

210
00:07:32,926 --> 00:07:35,446
compression in HEVC.

211
00:07:35,446 --> 00:07:36,246
And there is more.

212
00:07:37,056 --> 00:07:38,496
So having said that, how much

213
00:07:38,496 --> 00:07:39,846
improvement are we talking

214
00:07:39,846 --> 00:07:40,176
about?

215
00:07:40,446 --> 00:07:42,606
And this is why we're excited

216
00:07:42,606 --> 00:07:44,136
about introducing this next

217
00:07:44,136 --> 00:07:45,386
generation codec at Apple.

218
00:07:46,186 --> 00:07:47,576
In the case of general video

219
00:07:47,576 --> 00:07:49,666
content, we're seeing an up to

220
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:51,836
40 percent compression

221
00:07:51,836 --> 00:07:53,816
improvement over H.264.

222
00:07:54,506 --> 00:07:55,966
So you can generate the same

223
00:07:55,966 --> 00:07:57,446
quality video as you were doing

224
00:07:57,446 --> 00:07:59,276
previously but reduced 40

225
00:07:59,276 --> 00:08:00,396
percent less bandwidth.

226
00:07:59,276 --> 00:08:00,396
percent less bandwidth.

227
00:08:00,876 --> 00:08:01,966
Or you could keep the same

228
00:08:01,966 --> 00:08:03,306
bandwidth and significantly

229
00:08:03,306 --> 00:08:05,256
improve the video quality.

230
00:08:05,716 --> 00:08:07,056
And we've done quite a bit of

231
00:08:07,056 --> 00:08:08,976
subjective and objective testing

232
00:08:09,336 --> 00:08:10,646
to fine-tune the video to

233
00:08:10,646 --> 00:08:11,796
realize these benefits.

234
00:08:12,906 --> 00:08:14,616
In some use cases, we're seeing

235
00:08:14,616 --> 00:08:15,806
an even greater benefit.

236
00:08:16,436 --> 00:08:18,186
So we've really optimized our

237
00:08:18,186 --> 00:08:19,936
end-to-end pipeline with the iOS

238
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:20,866
Camera Capture.

239
00:08:21,306 --> 00:08:22,886
And in this use case, we're

240
00:08:22,886 --> 00:08:25,276
seeing an up to 2x improvement

241
00:08:25,276 --> 00:08:26,736
over H.264.

242
00:08:27,496 --> 00:08:28,736
What this means is you're able

243
00:08:28,736 --> 00:08:30,386
to now store twice as many

244
00:08:30,386 --> 00:08:32,926
movies as you could previously

245
00:08:32,926 --> 00:08:34,135
with H.264.

246
00:08:36,676 --> 00:08:38,466
Let's talk a little bit about

247
00:08:38,556 --> 00:08:40,336
the specifics of what we are

248
00:08:40,336 --> 00:08:40,916
supporting.

249
00:08:41,576 --> 00:08:45,556
Like H.264, HEVC also has the

250
00:08:45,556 --> 00:08:46,666
notion of profiles.

251
00:08:47,396 --> 00:08:49,476
And in HEVC, we're supporting

252
00:08:49,476 --> 00:08:52,336
the Main profile, the Main Still

253
00:08:52,336 --> 00:08:54,266
Picture profile, and finally the

254
00:08:54,266 --> 00:08:55,636
Main 10 profile.

255
00:08:56,226 --> 00:08:58,566
So with the Main 10 profile, we

256
00:08:58,566 --> 00:09:00,716
are now able to encode and

257
00:08:58,566 --> 00:09:00,716
are now able to encode and

258
00:09:00,716 --> 00:09:02,976
decode video with 10-bit

259
00:09:03,026 --> 00:09:03,626
precision.

260
00:09:04,246 --> 00:09:05,176
This means that you can

261
00:09:05,176 --> 00:09:06,966
represent more gray scales and

262
00:09:06,966 --> 00:09:08,876
more colors and increase the

263
00:09:08,876 --> 00:09:10,656
overall quality of the video

264
00:09:11,026 --> 00:09:12,746
end-to-end across our pipeline.

265
00:09:13,216 --> 00:09:18,836
With HEVC, we are requiring the

266
00:09:18,836 --> 00:09:22,126
hvc1 codec type for playback.

267
00:09:23,046 --> 00:09:24,576
This means that the parameter

268
00:09:24,576 --> 00:09:26,096
sets have to be stored in the

269
00:09:26,096 --> 00:09:28,486
decoder configuration record as

270
00:09:28,486 --> 00:09:29,956
opposed to within the samples or

271
00:09:29,956 --> 00:09:31,516
the payload itself.

272
00:09:32,046 --> 00:09:33,426
So make sure when you are

273
00:09:33,426 --> 00:09:35,936
creating HEVC assets that they

274
00:09:35,936 --> 00:09:38,776
are the hvc1 codec type to

275
00:09:38,776 --> 00:09:40,426
enable playback within the Apple

276
00:09:40,426 --> 00:09:41,056
ecosystem.

277
00:09:44,796 --> 00:09:47,426
Finally, we're lucky in that we

278
00:09:47,426 --> 00:09:48,996
can take advantage of the fact

279
00:09:48,996 --> 00:09:51,236
that HEVC naturally fits into

280
00:09:51,236 --> 00:09:53,266
the existing file formats.

281
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:55,206
So it fits nicely within the

282
00:09:55,206 --> 00:09:57,116
QuickTime movie file format as

283
00:09:57,116 --> 00:09:59,586
well as the ISO MPEG-4 file

284
00:09:59,636 --> 00:10:00,066
format.

285
00:09:59,636 --> 00:10:00,066
format.

286
00:10:02,776 --> 00:10:05,086
So we picked a technology that

287
00:10:05,086 --> 00:10:06,536
is well supported within the

288
00:10:06,536 --> 00:10:08,416
industry and within Apple's

289
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:09,066
ecosystem.

290
00:10:09,966 --> 00:10:10,946
It has both hardware and

291
00:10:10,946 --> 00:10:11,826
software support.

292
00:10:12,306 --> 00:10:13,086
And later on in the

293
00:10:13,086 --> 00:10:14,786
presentation, Gavin will go into

294
00:10:14,786 --> 00:10:18,186
the details about where and how

295
00:10:18,186 --> 00:10:18,886
that's supported.

296
00:10:21,936 --> 00:10:24,096
It works already with the file

297
00:10:24,096 --> 00:10:25,616
formats that we've talked about.

298
00:10:25,616 --> 00:10:27,036
So it's supporting the QuickTime

299
00:10:27,036 --> 00:10:28,766
movie file format and within the

300
00:10:28,766 --> 00:10:30,046
MPEG-4 file format.

301
00:10:30,766 --> 00:10:32,656
And finally, it's an ideal codec

302
00:10:33,086 --> 00:10:35,686
for both movies as well as still

303
00:10:35,686 --> 00:10:37,926
images, allowing us to use it in

304
00:10:37,926 --> 00:10:40,896
place of H.264 and JPEG.

305
00:10:41,496 --> 00:10:43,216
Now as I've mentioned, HEVC can

306
00:10:43,216 --> 00:10:45,126
use the existing movie file

307
00:10:45,126 --> 00:10:45,736
formats.

308
00:10:46,216 --> 00:10:48,466
That's not the case for when we

309
00:10:48,466 --> 00:10:49,836
want to use it for photos or

310
00:10:49,836 --> 00:10:50,376
images.

311
00:10:50,786 --> 00:10:52,866
So we needed to find a different

312
00:10:52,896 --> 00:10:54,246
file format that we could use

313
00:10:54,246 --> 00:10:56,416
for images that would allow us

314
00:10:56,496 --> 00:10:58,746
to use HEVC as the codec and

315
00:10:59,066 --> 00:11:01,276
that's where HEIF comes in.

316
00:10:59,066 --> 00:11:01,276
that's where HEIF comes in.

317
00:11:02,776 --> 00:11:05,096
So before we get into HEIF,

318
00:11:05,226 --> 00:11:06,496
let's talk a little bit about

319
00:11:06,496 --> 00:11:08,466
the requirements that we wanted

320
00:11:08,576 --> 00:11:11,496
satisfied when adopting a new

321
00:11:11,496 --> 00:11:13,406
file format for images.

322
00:11:14,606 --> 00:11:15,616
We wanted support for

323
00:11:15,616 --> 00:11:17,236
state-of-the-art compression

324
00:11:17,236 --> 00:11:19,206
technology with HEVC being the

325
00:11:19,206 --> 00:11:20,576
primary consideration.

326
00:11:21,866 --> 00:11:24,086
We wanted explicit support for

327
00:11:24,086 --> 00:11:25,806
alpha and depth channels as

328
00:11:25,856 --> 00:11:27,396
primary asset types.

329
00:11:28,436 --> 00:11:30,756
We needed support for animation

330
00:11:31,136 --> 00:11:33,976
with animated GIF or JIF and

331
00:11:33,976 --> 00:11:34,926
Live Photo.

332
00:11:35,296 --> 00:11:38,766
In addition to just still image

333
00:11:38,766 --> 00:11:41,096
support, we wanted support for

334
00:11:41,096 --> 00:11:43,356
image sequences, to be able to

335
00:11:43,356 --> 00:11:44,856
compress and represent those in

336
00:11:44,856 --> 00:11:46,886
a file format such as what

337
00:11:47,036 --> 00:11:48,476
happens when you're dealing with

338
00:11:48,476 --> 00:11:49,986
bursts of photos.

339
00:11:51,286 --> 00:11:52,926
And finally, with images getting

340
00:11:52,926 --> 00:11:55,026
larger and larger in size, it

341
00:11:55,026 --> 00:11:57,376
was important for us to be able

342
00:11:57,376 --> 00:11:59,106
to process these efficiently

343
00:11:59,496 --> 00:12:00,606
with low latency and a

344
00:11:59,496 --> 00:12:00,606
with low latency and a

345
00:12:00,606 --> 00:12:02,026
reasonable amount of

346
00:12:02,506 --> 00:12:03,386
performance.

347
00:12:03,616 --> 00:12:04,756
So when you've got a massive

348
00:12:04,756 --> 00:12:06,566
image, you want to be able to

349
00:12:06,866 --> 00:12:08,986
download it and start to preview

350
00:12:08,986 --> 00:12:09,966
it immediately.

351
00:12:10,306 --> 00:12:11,666
And if you're interested in a

352
00:12:11,706 --> 00:12:13,366
particular smaller region in a

353
00:12:13,366 --> 00:12:15,726
much wider image, you want to be

354
00:12:15,726 --> 00:12:18,006
able to just decode and process

355
00:12:18,046 --> 00:12:19,676
the relevant tiles.

356
00:12:20,196 --> 00:12:21,006
And so we were looking for

357
00:12:21,006 --> 00:12:22,376
something that would allow us to

358
00:12:22,376 --> 00:12:25,676
take advantage of this kind of a

359
00:12:26,436 --> 00:12:27,296
pipeline.

360
00:12:27,596 --> 00:12:29,246
So with these requirements in

361
00:12:29,246 --> 00:12:30,826
mind, we looked at a few options

362
00:12:31,106 --> 00:12:32,346
and we selected HEIF.

363
00:12:33,456 --> 00:12:35,086
HEIF stands for High Efficiency

364
00:12:35,126 --> 00:12:36,056
Image File Format.

365
00:12:36,986 --> 00:12:39,906
And like HEVC, it is also an

366
00:12:39,906 --> 00:12:41,626
industry standard that was

367
00:12:41,626 --> 00:12:44,476
ratified by ISO in 2015.

368
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:48,406
It's based on the familiar ISO

369
00:12:48,406 --> 00:12:49,956
Base Media File Format.

370
00:12:50,696 --> 00:12:53,716
It is extremely feature-rich.

371
00:12:54,836 --> 00:12:56,786
And it supports both individual

372
00:12:56,786 --> 00:12:58,286
images and sequences.

373
00:12:59,436 --> 00:13:01,446
There are many use cases in

374
00:12:59,436 --> 00:13:01,446
There are many use cases in

375
00:13:01,446 --> 00:13:02,836
addition to that, that are

376
00:13:02,836 --> 00:13:04,196
supported by this file format

377
00:13:04,726 --> 00:13:05,756
which allows for future

378
00:13:05,756 --> 00:13:06,656
extensibility.

379
00:13:07,216 --> 00:13:12,316
It typically uses HEVC for

380
00:13:12,316 --> 00:13:13,106
compression.

381
00:13:13,156 --> 00:13:14,426
It has the option where you can

382
00:13:14,426 --> 00:13:15,746
use other encoders.

383
00:13:16,046 --> 00:13:17,606
But at Apple, when we're

384
00:13:17,606 --> 00:13:20,066
generating HEIF assets, they

385
00:13:20,066 --> 00:13:23,566
will only be using the HEVC

386
00:13:24,476 --> 00:13:24,706
encoder.

387
00:13:24,796 --> 00:13:26,236
So why do all this for images?

388
00:13:27,506 --> 00:13:29,216
We saw the benefits for movies

389
00:13:29,216 --> 00:13:30,076
and videos.

390
00:13:30,596 --> 00:13:32,366
And for images, we're also

391
00:13:32,366 --> 00:13:33,746
seeing tremendous gains over

392
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:34,236
JPEG.

393
00:13:34,656 --> 00:13:37,706
So now using HEVC within HEIF,

394
00:13:38,496 --> 00:13:40,456
you're able to capture and store

395
00:13:40,546 --> 00:13:43,456
twice as many images as you were

396
00:13:43,456 --> 00:13:45,496
able to previously with JPEG.

397
00:13:47,696 --> 00:13:49,296
Let's talk a little bit about

398
00:13:49,386 --> 00:13:51,986
the different formats of HEIF

399
00:13:51,986 --> 00:13:52,896
that we are supporting.

400
00:13:53,486 --> 00:13:56,346
So as I mentioned from an encode

401
00:13:56,346 --> 00:13:58,076
or asset creation perspective,

402
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:00,496
we're going to be using the HEVC

403
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:00,496
we're going to be using the HEVC

404
00:14:00,496 --> 00:14:02,706
encoder, which means we're going

405
00:14:02,706 --> 00:14:05,346
to be generating the .heic file

406
00:14:05,346 --> 00:14:06,416
extension or .heic.

407
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:09,246
So that's what we're doing from

408
00:14:09,296 --> 00:14:10,736
asset generation perspective.

409
00:14:10,736 --> 00:14:12,836
So we'll be able to create and

410
00:14:12,836 --> 00:14:13,906
play back those files.

411
00:14:14,556 --> 00:14:16,586
In terms of playback, we're also

412
00:14:16,586 --> 00:14:19,816
going to support decoding H.264

413
00:14:19,986 --> 00:14:23,846
HEIF images and, more generally,

414
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:25,356
if there's another codec that's

415
00:14:25,356 --> 00:14:26,846
supported within our system,

416
00:14:27,206 --> 00:14:29,106
we'll also be able to decode and

417
00:14:29,106 --> 00:14:31,246
display those HEIF files.

418
00:14:35,976 --> 00:14:38,056
There is a great video that one

419
00:14:38,136 --> 00:14:38,976
of our colleagues [inaudible]

420
00:14:38,976 --> 00:14:41,276
has done which will provide more

421
00:14:41,276 --> 00:14:43,896
information into the HEIF file

422
00:14:43,896 --> 00:14:44,426
format.

423
00:14:44,426 --> 00:14:45,456
So -- and I think he'll be

424
00:14:45,456 --> 00:14:47,366
posted sometime later today or

425
00:14:47,366 --> 00:14:47,886
tomorrow.

426
00:14:48,266 --> 00:14:49,976
So please be sure to check that

427
00:14:49,976 --> 00:14:52,026
out if you want more details

428
00:14:52,426 --> 00:14:55,526
about the HEIF file format, the

429
00:14:55,526 --> 00:14:57,056
different atom types, and how to

430
00:14:57,056 --> 00:14:58,986
parse the file and process it.

431
00:15:00,636 --> 00:15:02,026
So now that we've talked about

432
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:03,496
these new technologies, what

433
00:15:03,566 --> 00:15:05,776
they are and why we decided to

434
00:15:05,776 --> 00:15:08,016
select them at Apple, we'd like

435
00:15:08,016 --> 00:15:09,936
to talk to you about how we are

436
00:15:09,936 --> 00:15:11,546
using them within the Apple

437
00:15:11,546 --> 00:15:13,636
ecosystem and then also provide

438
00:15:13,686 --> 00:15:15,856
some guidance on what you can do

439
00:15:15,856 --> 00:15:16,696
with these fantastic

440
00:15:16,696 --> 00:15:18,286
technologies in your apps and

441
00:15:18,286 --> 00:15:18,886
use cases.

442
00:15:19,866 --> 00:15:21,426
And to talk you through that,

443
00:15:21,426 --> 00:15:23,106
I'd like to hand things over to

444
00:15:23,106 --> 00:15:23,806
Gavin Thomson.

445
00:15:24,516 --> 00:15:30,486
[ Applause ]

446
00:15:30,986 --> 00:15:31,376
&gt;&gt; Thanks Athar.

447
00:15:31,866 --> 00:15:33,386
So my name is Gavin Thomson.

448
00:15:33,386 --> 00:15:34,676
I'm one of the engineering

449
00:15:34,756 --> 00:15:36,096
managers for the camera and

450
00:15:36,096 --> 00:15:37,386
photo organization at Apple.

451
00:15:39,656 --> 00:15:46,146
OK. So with -- we just learned a

452
00:15:46,366 --> 00:15:47,726
lot of the great benefits of

453
00:15:47,726 --> 00:15:48,956
HEIF and HEVC.

454
00:15:48,956 --> 00:15:50,446
But what are the ecosystem

455
00:15:50,446 --> 00:15:51,196
implications?

456
00:15:51,866 --> 00:15:53,796
So at Apple, we've been working

457
00:15:53,796 --> 00:15:55,836
over the last year to adopt HEIF

458
00:15:55,836 --> 00:15:57,146
and HEVC into the Apple

459
00:15:57,146 --> 00:15:57,866
ecosystem.

460
00:15:58,256 --> 00:16:01,036
So today I would like to share,

461
00:15:58,256 --> 00:16:01,036
So today I would like to share,

462
00:16:01,106 --> 00:16:02,336
talk about that adoption and

463
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:03,536
share the changes that were made

464
00:16:03,536 --> 00:16:04,966
to help with that transition.

465
00:16:05,996 --> 00:16:07,146
Our goal is to make the

466
00:16:07,146 --> 00:16:08,396
introduction of these new

467
00:16:08,396 --> 00:16:10,056
formats as transparent as

468
00:16:10,096 --> 00:16:10,516
possible.

469
00:16:11,146 --> 00:16:13,146
So there are three topics that I

470
00:16:13,146 --> 00:16:14,326
would like to talk about.

471
00:16:15,526 --> 00:16:17,866
First is creation: how and where

472
00:16:17,866 --> 00:16:19,256
we can create HEIF image and

473
00:16:19,256 --> 00:16:20,266
HEVC movie content.

474
00:16:21,696 --> 00:16:24,396
There is access: how and where

475
00:16:24,396 --> 00:16:26,526
to access HEIF and HEVC movie

476
00:16:26,526 --> 00:16:27,036
content.

477
00:16:27,796 --> 00:16:30,406
And finally transfer: so what

478
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:31,386
strategies do you need to

479
00:16:31,386 --> 00:16:33,106
consider when you want to move

480
00:16:33,106 --> 00:16:34,816
HEIF or HEVC content off a

481
00:16:34,816 --> 00:16:35,976
capture or supported device?

482
00:16:42,046 --> 00:16:43,436
So first I'd like to start with

483
00:16:43,436 --> 00:16:44,006
access.

484
00:16:44,246 --> 00:16:45,956
So we've discussed the

485
00:16:45,956 --> 00:16:47,576
extensibility of the HEIF format

486
00:16:47,576 --> 00:16:48,206
for images.

487
00:16:48,686 --> 00:16:49,176
What are some of the

488
00:16:49,176 --> 00:16:50,536
characteristics of the Apple

489
00:16:50,536 --> 00:16:51,716
generated HEIF images?

490
00:16:53,456 --> 00:16:55,786
So as we heard, the file format

491
00:16:55,786 --> 00:16:57,346
is an ISO Based Media format.

492
00:16:58,046 --> 00:16:59,356
So those of you that have look

493
00:16:59,356 --> 00:17:01,496
at the internals of the MP4 or a

494
00:16:59,356 --> 00:17:01,496
at the internals of the MP4 or a

495
00:17:01,496 --> 00:17:03,286
QuickTime movie file, be very

496
00:17:03,286 --> 00:17:04,195
familiar with the internal

497
00:17:04,195 --> 00:17:05,496
structure as they're based on

498
00:17:05,496 --> 00:17:06,336
the same standard.

499
00:17:06,906 --> 00:17:08,236
So I want to reiterate here,

500
00:17:08,536 --> 00:17:10,246
HEIF is a container format.

501
00:17:11,036 --> 00:17:12,205
Not too similar to the QuickTime

502
00:17:12,205 --> 00:17:13,425
movie file format.

503
00:17:14,106 --> 00:17:15,465
It's got many more options and a

504
00:17:15,465 --> 00:17:17,856
lot more flexibility than a JPEG

505
00:17:17,915 --> 00:17:18,646
file format.

506
00:17:20,816 --> 00:17:23,056
Now, our image payload is

507
00:17:23,056 --> 00:17:24,675
encoded using HEVC.

508
00:17:25,376 --> 00:17:26,346
And as we've learned, that

509
00:17:26,346 --> 00:17:27,806
provides great compression

510
00:17:27,806 --> 00:17:29,426
improvements over JPEG, up to

511
00:17:29,426 --> 00:17:29,956
2X.

512
00:17:32,276 --> 00:17:34,446
We also encode the image payload

513
00:17:34,446 --> 00:17:37,286
as 512 x 512 tiles.

514
00:17:37,286 --> 00:17:38,576
And amongst other advantages,

515
00:17:38,576 --> 00:17:40,106
that provides great flexibility

516
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:41,946
for fast incremental loading of

517
00:17:41,946 --> 00:17:45,646
high resolution content.

518
00:17:46,256 --> 00:17:48,436
We also have a 320 x 240

519
00:17:48,436 --> 00:17:50,596
embedded thumbnail, which is

520
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:52,446
four times the resolution but

521
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:54,436
only twice the size of our

522
00:17:54,436 --> 00:17:57,406
current 160 x 120 JPEG embedded

523
00:17:57,406 --> 00:17:57,966
thumbnail.

524
00:17:58,446 --> 00:17:59,266
Why can we do this?

525
00:17:59,266 --> 00:18:00,666
Because the thumbnail was also

526
00:17:59,266 --> 00:18:00,666
Because the thumbnail was also

527
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:04,066
encoded using HEVC.

528
00:18:04,776 --> 00:18:07,356
We still support an image, EXIF

529
00:18:07,356 --> 00:18:09,766
metadata payload compatible with

530
00:18:09,826 --> 00:18:10,976
the payload that we capture in

531
00:18:10,976 --> 00:18:11,916
our JPEG format.

532
00:18:15,506 --> 00:18:17,996
So HEIF with the HEVC encoded

533
00:18:17,996 --> 00:18:19,336
image will be identified in the

534
00:18:19,336 --> 00:18:21,486
file system with a new extension

535
00:18:21,816 --> 00:18:24,596
.heic or .heic as we call it.

536
00:18:25,136 --> 00:18:26,636
So some will know this is a

537
00:18:26,636 --> 00:18:29,296
breakaway from the DCF 8.3

538
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:30,766
filenaming convention.

539
00:18:31,296 --> 00:18:32,496
So if you have any assumptions

540
00:18:32,526 --> 00:18:34,026
with your file name parsers, a

541
00:18:34,026 --> 00:18:34,926
variant three character

542
00:18:34,926 --> 00:18:36,596
extension, we now have the

543
00:18:36,596 --> 00:18:38,426
default still capture format

544
00:18:38,426 --> 00:18:39,486
that has four characters.

545
00:18:43,676 --> 00:18:44,986
So where is HEIF decode

546
00:18:44,986 --> 00:18:45,566
supported?

547
00:18:45,896 --> 00:18:48,016
It's supported on all of our --

548
00:18:48,016 --> 00:18:50,106
it's available on all of our

549
00:18:50,106 --> 00:18:51,816
supported platforms that have

550
00:18:51,816 --> 00:18:54,656
macOS 10.3 or iOS 11 installed

551
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:55,946
but there's a variety of

552
00:18:55,946 --> 00:18:58,676
hardware and software support.

553
00:18:58,756 --> 00:19:01,026
For iOS, we have hardware decode

554
00:18:58,756 --> 00:19:01,026
For iOS, we have hardware decode

555
00:19:01,026 --> 00:19:02,876
on the minimum config of the A9

556
00:19:02,876 --> 00:19:03,156
chip.

557
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:04,836
An example, of which, is the

558
00:19:04,836 --> 00:19:06,876
iPhone 6S or the iPad Pro.

559
00:19:08,116 --> 00:19:09,656
On macOS, we have hardware

560
00:19:09,656 --> 00:19:10,616
decode support on the

561
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:12,376
sixth-generation Intel Core,

562
00:19:12,376 --> 00:19:13,746
which is the Skylake family of

563
00:19:13,746 --> 00:19:14,456
processors.

564
00:19:15,186 --> 00:19:17,836
An example of that machine is

565
00:19:17,836 --> 00:19:18,696
the new MacBook with the

566
00:19:18,696 --> 00:19:21,396
touchbar, but we have software

567
00:19:21,396 --> 00:19:22,896
decode support on all of our

568
00:19:22,896 --> 00:19:25,196
supported iOS and macOS devices.

569
00:19:28,236 --> 00:19:30,026
So where do we have HEIF image

570
00:19:30,026 --> 00:19:30,546
support?

571
00:19:32,136 --> 00:19:34,446
ImageIO was Apple's lowest level

572
00:19:35,036 --> 00:19:35,896
image framework.

573
00:19:36,066 --> 00:19:37,826
And it supports HEIF as a source

574
00:19:37,826 --> 00:19:40,146
for decode, incremental loading,

575
00:19:40,176 --> 00:19:41,726
metadata, and thumbnail

576
00:19:41,726 --> 00:19:42,376
abstraction.

577
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:44,156
This is in line for their other

578
00:19:44,156 --> 00:19:46,396
supported image formats using

579
00:19:46,396 --> 00:19:49,886
exactly the same APIs.

580
00:19:50,226 --> 00:19:51,926
Core Image also supports HEIF as

581
00:19:51,926 --> 00:19:53,256
a source for real-time image

582
00:19:53,256 --> 00:19:54,006
manipulation.

583
00:19:56,256 --> 00:19:57,666
And the PhotoKit APIs which

584
00:19:57,666 --> 00:19:59,186
allow access to assets in the

585
00:19:59,186 --> 00:20:00,576
photo library also supports

586
00:19:59,186 --> 00:20:00,576
photo library also supports

587
00:20:00,576 --> 00:20:02,256
direct access to HEIF, but I'll

588
00:20:02,256 --> 00:20:03,906
talk about this framework in a

589
00:20:03,906 --> 00:20:05,006
little more detail in the coming

590
00:20:05,006 --> 00:20:05,546
slides.

591
00:20:08,336 --> 00:20:10,206
Many of Apple's many based

592
00:20:10,206 --> 00:20:11,686
applications will also natively

593
00:20:11,686 --> 00:20:12,506
work with HEIF.

594
00:20:12,626 --> 00:20:14,536
Notable amongst those is photos,

595
00:20:14,596 --> 00:20:16,576
preview, Quick Look but there

596
00:20:16,576 --> 00:20:17,436
are also many others.

597
00:20:19,806 --> 00:20:21,246
OK. Let's move to our movie

598
00:20:21,246 --> 00:20:22,496
format and talk a little bit

599
00:20:22,496 --> 00:20:24,626
about Apple captured HEVC

600
00:20:24,716 --> 00:20:25,346
movies.

601
00:20:27,796 --> 00:20:28,906
So the changes here aren't as

602
00:20:28,906 --> 00:20:30,816
drastic as our newly supported

603
00:20:30,816 --> 00:20:31,536
image format.

604
00:20:32,076 --> 00:20:33,526
We're still capturing using the

605
00:20:33,526 --> 00:20:36,446
QuickTime file format but with

606
00:20:36,486 --> 00:20:38,336
HEVC coded video frames.

607
00:20:38,826 --> 00:20:40,116
As we've learned for Apple

608
00:20:40,446 --> 00:20:41,796
captured video, we're getting

609
00:20:41,836 --> 00:20:42,946
twice the compression that we're

610
00:20:42,946 --> 00:20:44,686
getting from H.264.

611
00:20:44,686 --> 00:20:46,346
And, once again, just to call

612
00:20:46,346 --> 00:20:48,126
out again, we're using HEVC to

613
00:20:48,306 --> 00:20:50,096
encode both our images and our

614
00:20:50,096 --> 00:20:50,966
video formats.

615
00:20:55,996 --> 00:20:58,846
We also support both an 8- and a

616
00:20:58,846 --> 00:20:59,826
10-bit encoding.

617
00:21:00,226 --> 00:21:01,626
So those of you that really care

618
00:21:01,626 --> 00:21:03,156
about image quality or deep

619
00:21:03,156 --> 00:21:05,376
color, we have a non-real-time,

620
00:21:05,426 --> 00:21:06,996
a 10-bit software encoder on

621
00:21:06,996 --> 00:21:08,606
macOS to satisfy your needs.

622
00:21:11,786 --> 00:21:13,076
You'll be happy to learn, with

623
00:21:13,176 --> 00:21:14,166
this new format, we have

624
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:15,776
retained the three character

625
00:21:15,776 --> 00:21:17,476
.mov extensions, so you won't

626
00:21:17,476 --> 00:21:18,576
have to update any of your

627
00:21:18,856 --> 00:21:20,896
filename parsers for this media

628
00:21:23,656 --> 00:21:24,056
format.

629
00:21:24,636 --> 00:21:27,066
OK. So where do we have decode

630
00:21:27,316 --> 00:21:29,636
support for HEVC movies?

631
00:21:29,926 --> 00:21:31,496
So we have both 8- and 10-bit

632
00:21:31,646 --> 00:21:33,606
decode which is available on all

633
00:21:33,606 --> 00:21:34,896
our supported platforms with,

634
00:21:34,896 --> 00:21:37,286
once again, macOS 10.13 and iOS

635
00:21:37,286 --> 00:21:38,996
11, but there's a variety of

636
00:21:38,996 --> 00:21:41,366
hardware and software support.

637
00:21:41,366 --> 00:21:43,606
So in iOS, we have both 8- and

638
00:21:43,606 --> 00:21:45,086
10-bit hardware decode on the

639
00:21:45,086 --> 00:21:46,546
minimum config of the A9 chip.

640
00:21:47,396 --> 00:21:49,516
Once again, the iPhone 6S is an

641
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:50,326
example there.

642
00:21:51,286 --> 00:21:52,816
For macOS, we have 8-bit

643
00:21:52,816 --> 00:21:53,936
hardware decode in

644
00:21:53,936 --> 00:21:55,376
sixth-generation Intel Core

645
00:21:55,376 --> 00:21:56,916
processor which is the Skylake

646
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:58,066
family of processors.

647
00:21:58,486 --> 00:22:00,346
And we have 10-bit hardware

648
00:21:58,486 --> 00:22:00,346
And we have 10-bit hardware

649
00:22:00,346 --> 00:22:01,696
decode support on the

650
00:22:01,736 --> 00:22:03,326
seventh-generation Intel Core

651
00:22:03,326 --> 00:22:05,046
processors or the Kaby Lake

652
00:22:05,046 --> 00:22:06,276
family of processors.

653
00:22:06,966 --> 00:22:09,176
And we have both 8- and 10-bit

654
00:22:09,176 --> 00:22:10,946
software decode across all of

655
00:22:10,946 --> 00:22:13,756
our supported macOS and iOS

656
00:22:13,796 --> 00:22:14,306
platforms.

657
00:22:18,296 --> 00:22:20,236
OK. So where do we support HEVC

658
00:22:20,236 --> 00:22:21,076
movies?

659
00:22:24,066 --> 00:22:25,946
AVFoundation is the primal

660
00:22:25,946 --> 00:22:27,666
framework to manage movies.

661
00:22:27,886 --> 00:22:29,416
And it supports play, create,

662
00:22:29,416 --> 00:22:30,996
and edit workflows for HEVC

663
00:22:30,996 --> 00:22:31,576
content.

664
00:22:32,086 --> 00:22:35,366
Once again, PhotoKit will vend

665
00:22:35,366 --> 00:22:38,066
original HEVC movies.

666
00:22:38,186 --> 00:22:40,386
WebKit will also playback HEVC

667
00:22:40,386 --> 00:22:43,976
movies but only on devices that

668
00:22:43,976 --> 00:22:45,576
have hardware acceleration and

669
00:22:45,576 --> 00:22:47,746
all macOS desktops.

670
00:22:48,456 --> 00:22:50,426
There's also support to

671
00:22:50,546 --> 00:22:52,706
encourage HLS streams using

672
00:22:52,706 --> 00:22:53,816
HEVC.

673
00:22:54,766 --> 00:22:55,796
This represents a great

674
00:22:55,796 --> 00:22:58,536
opportunity to improve network

675
00:22:59,076 --> 00:22:59,696
throughput.

676
00:23:00,506 --> 00:23:01,706
And, in fact, the session

677
00:23:01,706 --> 00:23:03,026
directly after this is going to

678
00:23:03,026 --> 00:23:05,046
talk about this initiative in

679
00:23:05,046 --> 00:23:06,026
much more detail.

680
00:23:08,336 --> 00:23:10,426
Also, we have many Apple

681
00:23:10,426 --> 00:23:11,656
applications that will natively

682
00:23:11,656 --> 00:23:13,546
work with HEVC movies, you know,

683
00:23:13,546 --> 00:23:14,736
QuickTime player, Quick Look

684
00:23:14,736 --> 00:23:17,096
photos but also FaceTime.

685
00:23:17,256 --> 00:23:19,096
This is a great example of HEVC

686
00:23:19,156 --> 00:23:21,046
usage to greatly improve network

687
00:23:21,046 --> 00:23:21,556
throughput.

688
00:23:22,336 --> 00:23:25,646
So we have decode support for

689
00:23:25,736 --> 00:23:28,536
HEVC across all of our devices.

690
00:23:28,996 --> 00:23:30,036
What about playback?

691
00:23:30,596 --> 00:23:32,176
This is where the distinction

692
00:23:32,176 --> 00:23:33,736
between decodable and playable

693
00:23:33,736 --> 00:23:35,446
is very important and

694
00:23:35,556 --> 00:23:37,486
particularly so with HEVC.

695
00:23:38,176 --> 00:23:40,306
This is unfamiliar territory for

696
00:23:40,306 --> 00:23:41,016
many of us.

697
00:23:41,166 --> 00:23:42,456
We don't have hardware

698
00:23:42,456 --> 00:23:43,996
acceleration across all

699
00:23:43,996 --> 00:23:46,116
supported devices for default

700
00:23:46,116 --> 00:23:46,856
capture format.

701
00:23:47,646 --> 00:23:48,826
And this is a problem we haven't

702
00:23:48,826 --> 00:23:50,436
had to deal with for a long time

703
00:23:50,436 --> 00:23:53,736
as H.264 hardware decode is

704
00:23:53,736 --> 00:23:57,506
fairly ubiquitous at this point.

705
00:23:57,556 --> 00:23:58,946
So all of our movie formats are

706
00:23:58,946 --> 00:24:01,026
decodable but on some software

707
00:23:58,946 --> 00:24:01,026
decodable but on some software

708
00:24:01,026 --> 00:24:02,466
systems, there will be formats

709
00:24:02,466 --> 00:24:03,346
that are much slower than

710
00:24:03,346 --> 00:24:04,636
real-time and really only

711
00:24:04,636 --> 00:24:06,106
supported for export or

712
00:24:06,106 --> 00:24:07,276
transcode workflows.

713
00:24:07,276 --> 00:24:08,716
So how do you make the

714
00:24:08,716 --> 00:24:11,176
determination that a format is

715
00:24:11,866 --> 00:24:13,396
suitable for playback on a given

716
00:24:13,396 --> 00:24:13,896
device?

717
00:24:15,576 --> 00:24:18,026
So AVFoundation, through its

718
00:24:18,026 --> 00:24:19,646
API, supports the notion of

719
00:24:19,736 --> 00:24:20,466
"isPlayable."

720
00:24:21,246 --> 00:24:22,346
And this indicates whether a

721
00:24:22,346 --> 00:24:24,106
device's video level supports

722
00:24:24,326 --> 00:24:26,136
the movie for playback.

723
00:24:26,946 --> 00:24:28,336
If true, you should experience

724
00:24:28,336 --> 00:24:29,936
smooth playback without

725
00:24:29,936 --> 00:24:31,426
incurring any significant power

726
00:24:31,536 --> 00:24:33,146
or [inaudible] cost for videos

727
00:24:33,146 --> 00:24:34,466
of extended durations.

728
00:24:36,856 --> 00:24:39,416
For example, even though Apple

729
00:24:39,416 --> 00:24:41,236
captured 4K30 is decodable

730
00:24:41,236 --> 00:24:42,296
across all of our supported

731
00:24:42,296 --> 00:24:44,166
systems, it's unlikely to be

732
00:24:44,166 --> 00:24:45,296
marked as playable on some of

733
00:24:45,296 --> 00:24:46,746
our older hardware like the

734
00:24:46,746 --> 00:24:47,606
iPhone 5S.

735
00:24:47,666 --> 00:24:49,226
So this is a call out to

736
00:24:49,226 --> 00:24:49,906
developers.

737
00:24:49,906 --> 00:24:51,306
It's really, really important,

738
00:24:51,306 --> 00:24:52,726
at this junction, for you to be

739
00:24:53,036 --> 00:24:54,656
observing these playable state

740
00:24:55,086 --> 00:24:56,876
to ensure we provide the best

741
00:24:56,876 --> 00:24:58,246
possible user experience.

742
00:25:01,936 --> 00:25:04,276
OK. For many developers, their

743
00:25:04,276 --> 00:25:05,686
first interaction with original

744
00:25:05,686 --> 00:25:07,366
HEIF and HEVC content will be

745
00:25:07,366 --> 00:25:09,376
through one of the public photo

746
00:25:10,196 --> 00:25:10,346
APIs.

747
00:25:11,576 --> 00:25:13,466
PhotoKit is the widely used

748
00:25:13,466 --> 00:25:14,956
photos API on iOS.

749
00:25:15,666 --> 00:25:16,726
And during his conference,

750
00:25:16,726 --> 00:25:17,756
they'll be some announcements

751
00:25:17,756 --> 00:25:19,896
about its availability on macOS.

752
00:25:19,896 --> 00:25:21,866
So look to the what's new photo

753
00:25:21,866 --> 00:25:22,866
session tomorrow for more

754
00:25:22,866 --> 00:25:24,826
details on that, but it will

755
00:25:24,826 --> 00:25:26,796
vend original HEIF and HEVC

756
00:25:27,496 --> 00:25:28,546
movie content.

757
00:25:28,886 --> 00:25:30,226
Also, the deprecated

758
00:25:30,276 --> 00:25:31,966
AssetLibrary framework is still

759
00:25:31,966 --> 00:25:33,836
very popular in the development

760
00:25:33,836 --> 00:25:34,226
community.

761
00:25:34,226 --> 00:25:36,946
And it will also vend HEIF and

762
00:25:37,866 --> 00:25:39,536
HEVC content.

763
00:25:40,116 --> 00:25:41,586
On macOS, there is also the

764
00:25:41,586 --> 00:25:42,626
Media Library API.

765
00:25:43,286 --> 00:25:45,406
For this release, it will only

766
00:25:45,406 --> 00:25:46,616
be vending transcoded

767
00:25:46,616 --> 00:25:48,556
representations of HEIF and HEVC

768
00:25:48,556 --> 00:25:51,366
as JPEG and H.264 have been an

769
00:25:51,366 --> 00:25:52,406
equivalent resolution.

770
00:25:55,796 --> 00:25:56,886
Because of the popularity of

771
00:25:56,886 --> 00:25:58,386
PhotoKit to access media on

772
00:25:58,386 --> 00:25:59,766
Apple platforms, I wanted to

773
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:01,116
highlight some of the classes

774
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:01,116
highlight some of the classes

775
00:26:01,496 --> 00:26:02,606
through which you can access

776
00:26:02,606 --> 00:26:04,276
HEIF and HEVC content.

777
00:26:05,916 --> 00:26:07,986
When requesting images, you use

778
00:26:07,986 --> 00:26:09,066
the PHImageManager.

779
00:26:09,766 --> 00:26:11,136
Through this class, you can

780
00:26:11,136 --> 00:26:13,136
request original HEIF images.

781
00:26:14,056 --> 00:26:15,216
Also, remember requesting video

782
00:26:15,216 --> 00:26:17,166
objects, you can also use the

783
00:26:17,166 --> 00:26:19,506
PHImageManager to request HEVC

784
00:26:19,506 --> 00:26:20,396
movies.

785
00:26:22,176 --> 00:26:25,676
For managing resources, we have

786
00:26:25,676 --> 00:26:28,126
the PHAssetResourceManager which

787
00:26:28,126 --> 00:26:29,696
allows you to manage all the

788
00:26:29,696 --> 00:26:31,006
discrete resources in the photo

789
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:31,496
library.

790
00:26:31,776 --> 00:26:33,296
Amongst those could be HEIF and

791
00:26:33,296 --> 00:26:34,246
HEVC content.

792
00:26:37,416 --> 00:26:39,026
And for edit workflows, we have

793
00:26:39,026 --> 00:26:41,066
the PHContentEditinginput.

794
00:26:41,066 --> 00:26:43,226
And it will support HEIF image

795
00:26:43,276 --> 00:26:45,466
or HEVC movies as input to an

796
00:26:45,466 --> 00:26:46,146
edit session.

797
00:26:46,726 --> 00:26:50,716
So a point that I really want to

798
00:26:50,716 --> 00:26:51,966
stress here is that if you're

799
00:26:51,966 --> 00:26:53,386
already using Apple frameworks

800
00:26:53,416 --> 00:26:55,326
to manage media, the transition

801
00:26:55,326 --> 00:26:57,256
to HEIF or HEVC should be

802
00:26:57,256 --> 00:26:58,266
transparent.

803
00:26:58,656 --> 00:26:59,956
On the other hand, if you

804
00:26:59,956 --> 00:27:01,596
[inaudible] image or video

805
00:26:59,956 --> 00:27:01,596
[inaudible] image or video

806
00:27:01,596 --> 00:27:03,686
stack, you might need to revisit

807
00:27:03,686 --> 00:27:05,426
that integration and possibly

808
00:27:05,426 --> 00:27:06,626
consider adopting one of the

809
00:27:06,626 --> 00:27:08,356
appropriate Apple frameworks.

810
00:27:08,986 --> 00:27:11,466
Amongst those are ImageIO for

811
00:27:11,466 --> 00:27:14,376
images, AVFoundation for videos,

812
00:27:15,786 --> 00:27:18,206
Core Image for video frame or

813
00:27:18,366 --> 00:27:19,386
image manipulation.

814
00:27:20,396 --> 00:27:22,366
We have UIKit for presentation.

815
00:27:24,236 --> 00:27:26,556
We have PhotoKit to access the

816
00:27:26,556 --> 00:27:27,746
resources within the photo

817
00:27:27,746 --> 00:27:28,236
library.

818
00:27:29,086 --> 00:27:30,776
So usage of HEIF and HEVC

819
00:27:30,776 --> 00:27:32,466
through these frameworks will be

820
00:27:32,466 --> 00:27:33,176
transparent.

821
00:27:35,546 --> 00:27:36,896
I'm going to make a second call

822
00:27:36,896 --> 00:27:38,166
out to the session that we have

823
00:27:38,246 --> 00:27:40,236
Friday at 11:00 a.m. working

824
00:27:40,236 --> 00:27:41,116
with HEIF and HEVC.

825
00:27:41,206 --> 00:27:42,996
There are lots of great code

826
00:27:42,996 --> 00:27:45,226
examples of using HEIF and HEVC

827
00:27:45,326 --> 00:27:46,996
with these frameworks.

828
00:27:47,606 --> 00:27:49,166
I highly recommend it.

829
00:27:50,446 --> 00:27:52,546
OK. That was access.

830
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:54,256
Let's move on to creation.

831
00:27:55,406 --> 00:27:57,646
So where and how can we create

832
00:27:57,646 --> 00:27:59,546
HEIF image and HEVC movie

833
00:27:59,546 --> 00:28:00,076
content?

834
00:27:59,546 --> 00:28:00,076
content?

835
00:28:01,356 --> 00:28:03,236
So, as you can see, we currently

836
00:28:03,236 --> 00:28:05,586
only have HEIF encode support

837
00:28:05,586 --> 00:28:08,096
and hardware on iOS with minimum

838
00:28:08,096 --> 00:28:09,556
configuration being the A10

839
00:28:09,556 --> 00:28:11,316
Fusion chip, an example, of

840
00:28:11,316 --> 00:28:13,026
which, is the iPhone 7 and the

841
00:28:13,026 --> 00:28:13,956
iPhone 7 Plus.

842
00:28:14,516 --> 00:28:15,816
So the notable exception at this

843
00:28:15,816 --> 00:28:17,256
point in time is HEIF encode

844
00:28:17,256 --> 00:28:21,036
support on macOS.

845
00:28:21,636 --> 00:28:23,856
How do we create HEIF images?

846
00:28:24,766 --> 00:28:26,726
ImageIO supports HEIF as a

847
00:28:26,726 --> 00:28:27,476
destination.

848
00:28:28,046 --> 00:28:28,816
So you could consider

849
00:28:28,816 --> 00:28:31,456
transcoding your JPEG resources

850
00:28:31,456 --> 00:28:33,546
to HEIF for great storage or

851
00:28:33,666 --> 00:28:34,726
network benefits.

852
00:28:35,206 --> 00:28:38,596
Also, the AVFoundation capture

853
00:28:38,596 --> 00:28:40,616
APIs will support HEIF captured

854
00:28:40,616 --> 00:28:43,906
directly from the camera.

855
00:28:44,846 --> 00:28:47,516
As Athar said, so all the Apple

856
00:28:47,516 --> 00:28:48,786
camera modes will default to

857
00:28:48,786 --> 00:28:50,146
HEIF with the bursts being the

858
00:28:50,146 --> 00:28:51,026
only exception.

859
00:28:51,346 --> 00:28:52,306
So if you have installed the

860
00:28:52,366 --> 00:28:53,746
seed builds on supported

861
00:28:53,746 --> 00:28:55,136
hardware and you're taking

862
00:28:55,136 --> 00:28:57,576
photos, you're capturing them in

863
00:28:57,576 --> 00:28:58,306
the HEIF format.

864
00:28:59,746 --> 00:29:01,576
It's also worth reemphasizing

865
00:28:59,746 --> 00:29:01,576
It's also worth reemphasizing

866
00:29:01,776 --> 00:29:03,506
that only the HEIC variation of

867
00:29:03,506 --> 00:29:05,126
HEIF is supported from code

868
00:29:05,126 --> 00:29:06,146
through Apple frameworks.

869
00:29:06,586 --> 00:29:08,116
So HEIF images with the .hvc

870
00:29:08,206 --> 00:29:09,436
encoded image.

871
00:29:09,986 --> 00:29:14,206
Let's move to movie creation.

872
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:16,316
Here are at the table showing

873
00:29:16,556 --> 00:29:18,116
where we have HEVC encode

874
00:29:18,116 --> 00:29:18,586
support.

875
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:21,276
So in iOS, we have 8-bit encode

876
00:29:21,276 --> 00:29:22,876
support with minimum

877
00:29:22,876 --> 00:29:24,626
configuration of the A10 Fusion

878
00:29:24,626 --> 00:29:26,296
chip, the iPhone 7 for example.

879
00:29:27,076 --> 00:29:29,316
On macOS, we have 8-bit hardware

880
00:29:29,316 --> 00:29:30,816
encode on the sixth-generation

881
00:29:30,816 --> 00:29:32,146
Intel Core processor or the

882
00:29:32,146 --> 00:29:33,786
Skylake family of processors.

883
00:29:34,706 --> 00:29:36,776
And also on macOS in software we

884
00:29:36,776 --> 00:29:39,086
have a 10-bit encode support.

885
00:29:39,916 --> 00:29:42,226
How do we create HEVC movies?

886
00:29:43,756 --> 00:29:45,686
So AVFoundation is a framework

887
00:29:45,686 --> 00:29:46,816
for movie creation.

888
00:29:47,286 --> 00:29:49,016
And HEVC movies can be created

889
00:29:49,016 --> 00:29:50,596
through an AVFoundation export

890
00:29:50,596 --> 00:29:51,036
session.

891
00:29:51,566 --> 00:29:55,536
So you could export H.264 to

892
00:29:55,536 --> 00:29:56,676
HEVC for great storage or

893
00:29:56,676 --> 00:29:57,866
network optimizations.

894
00:29:58,496 --> 00:30:01,666
You can also capture HEIF movies

895
00:29:58,496 --> 00:30:01,666
You can also capture HEIF movies

896
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:03,056
directly through an AVFoundation

897
00:30:03,056 --> 00:30:06,776
capture session with a camera.

898
00:30:07,066 --> 00:30:08,746
Also, all the current movie

899
00:30:08,746 --> 00:30:10,766
camera modes will default to

900
00:30:10,766 --> 00:30:12,456
HEVC encoded movies.

901
00:30:12,456 --> 00:30:13,996
So, once again, if you've

902
00:30:13,996 --> 00:30:15,846
installed the seed builds and

903
00:30:15,846 --> 00:30:18,456
you're taking movies, you're

904
00:30:18,456 --> 00:30:22,856
capturing them as HEVC movies.

905
00:30:23,336 --> 00:30:24,246
That was creation.

906
00:30:24,926 --> 00:30:26,486
Next we come to transfer.

907
00:30:27,536 --> 00:30:29,256
So what questions should we be

908
00:30:29,256 --> 00:30:30,186
considering when we want to

909
00:30:30,186 --> 00:30:31,846
transfer HEIF image of HEVC

910
00:30:31,846 --> 00:30:35,636
movies from a creation device or

911
00:30:35,636 --> 00:30:36,996
other supported devices?

912
00:30:39,556 --> 00:30:41,366
When transferring HEIF or HEVC

913
00:30:41,366 --> 00:30:43,136
off a supported device, you

914
00:30:43,136 --> 00:30:44,456
don't have the same ecosystem to

915
00:30:44,456 --> 00:30:46,656
code support that JPEG or H.264

916
00:30:46,656 --> 00:30:47,196
provides.

917
00:30:47,806 --> 00:30:48,616
You might want to consider

918
00:30:48,616 --> 00:30:49,426
transcoding.

919
00:30:50,776 --> 00:30:52,336
There are a few approaches you

920
00:30:52,336 --> 00:30:53,096
might want to consider.

921
00:30:53,626 --> 00:30:55,346
The first and the simplest would

922
00:30:55,346 --> 00:30:56,916
be to always transcode.

923
00:30:58,056 --> 00:30:59,806
Another option might be to

924
00:30:59,806 --> 00:31:02,036
support a capabilities exchange.

925
00:30:59,806 --> 00:31:02,036
support a capabilities exchange.

926
00:31:02,566 --> 00:31:05,766
Let's start with looking at an

927
00:31:05,766 --> 00:31:07,226
example for workflow where you

928
00:31:07,226 --> 00:31:08,476
might always transcode.

929
00:31:10,816 --> 00:31:12,466
In this example, you have your

930
00:31:12,466 --> 00:31:13,806
own social networking client

931
00:31:13,926 --> 00:31:15,806
that allows users to add HEIF or

932
00:31:15,806 --> 00:31:17,966
HEVC content to a timeline.

933
00:31:19,336 --> 00:31:21,076
So with this architecture, there

934
00:31:21,076 --> 00:31:22,266
is really no opportunity to

935
00:31:22,266 --> 00:31:24,106
evaluate the capabilities of all

936
00:31:24,106 --> 00:31:25,786
the receiving devices and

937
00:31:25,786 --> 00:31:27,266
possibly no server transcode

938
00:31:27,266 --> 00:31:27,716
support.

939
00:31:29,016 --> 00:31:31,306
So the option here is to always

940
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:32,016
transcode.

941
00:31:32,566 --> 00:31:37,326
So for this scenario, both

942
00:31:37,526 --> 00:31:38,986
supported and unsupported

943
00:31:38,986 --> 00:31:40,366
devices would receive the

944
00:31:40,366 --> 00:31:42,226
transcoded representation, for

945
00:31:42,226 --> 00:31:47,426
example a JPEG or H.264.

946
00:31:47,426 --> 00:31:48,856
Another approach that we might

947
00:31:48,856 --> 00:31:49,666
want to consider is a

948
00:31:49,666 --> 00:31:51,106
capabilities exchange.

949
00:31:52,046 --> 00:31:53,496
Let's take a look at an example

950
00:31:53,546 --> 00:31:54,386
of that workflow.

951
00:31:55,776 --> 00:31:56,866
So here you might have a

952
00:31:57,426 --> 00:31:58,696
application that is adopted,

953
00:31:58,696 --> 00:32:00,366
Apple's Multipeer Connectivity

954
00:31:58,696 --> 00:32:00,366
Apple's Multipeer Connectivity

955
00:32:00,366 --> 00:32:00,796
APIs.

956
00:32:01,696 --> 00:32:03,246
If you're exchanging media with

957
00:32:03,246 --> 00:32:04,986
a supported device, you don't

958
00:32:04,986 --> 00:32:06,476
want to incur the cost of

959
00:32:06,476 --> 00:32:07,966
transcode and high network

960
00:32:07,966 --> 00:32:09,526
latency of always sending a

961
00:32:09,526 --> 00:32:11,826
transcoded JPEG or H.264.

962
00:32:12,356 --> 00:32:15,086
So you could introduce your

963
00:32:15,086 --> 00:32:16,496
capabilities exchange in the

964
00:32:16,496 --> 00:32:17,436
initial handshake.

965
00:32:19,716 --> 00:32:21,736
The sending device would

966
00:32:21,736 --> 00:32:23,336
evaluate the capabilities of the

967
00:32:23,336 --> 00:32:24,976
receiving device and decide

968
00:32:24,976 --> 00:32:26,276
whether to transcode or not.

969
00:32:27,046 --> 00:32:29,196
So the hope, over time, is that

970
00:32:29,196 --> 00:32:30,576
as the support for these formats

971
00:32:30,746 --> 00:32:34,776
grows, the amount of times that

972
00:32:34,776 --> 00:32:36,566
we need to transcode decreases.

973
00:32:37,426 --> 00:32:38,916
So this strategy is really

974
00:32:38,916 --> 00:32:40,646
suitable for both P2P and in

975
00:32:40,646 --> 00:32:42,026
client/server architectures.

976
00:32:44,676 --> 00:32:46,566
So how is Apple handling many

977
00:32:46,566 --> 00:32:47,606
similar workflows?

978
00:32:47,996 --> 00:32:51,616
Here are a couple of examples.

979
00:32:51,876 --> 00:32:53,406
So it's mail.

980
00:32:53,486 --> 00:32:54,796
It's not really possible to

981
00:32:54,796 --> 00:32:56,306
evaluate the capabilities of all

982
00:32:56,306 --> 00:32:57,286
the receiving clients.

983
00:32:57,286 --> 00:32:58,536
And we don't have server

984
00:32:58,536 --> 00:33:00,646
transcode support so before

985
00:32:58,536 --> 00:33:00,646
transcode support so before

986
00:33:00,646 --> 00:33:03,746
sending HEIF or HEVC as a mail

987
00:33:03,816 --> 00:33:06,026
attachment, we always transcode.

988
00:33:06,576 --> 00:33:08,956
Now for those developers that

989
00:33:08,956 --> 00:33:11,066
have share extensions, we'll

990
00:33:11,066 --> 00:33:14,016
also transcode before handing

991
00:33:14,016 --> 00:33:16,556
off a HEIF or HEVC.

992
00:33:16,686 --> 00:33:18,646
This simplifies that integration

993
00:33:18,716 --> 00:33:20,576
for the time being anyway.

994
00:33:22,796 --> 00:33:24,566
We've also adopted the

995
00:33:24,566 --> 00:33:25,686
capabilities exchange for a

996
00:33:25,686 --> 00:33:26,696
number of workflows.

997
00:33:26,996 --> 00:33:29,466
Example of those, P2P and

998
00:33:29,466 --> 00:33:29,896
AirDrop.

999
00:33:30,596 --> 00:33:33,166
So with these integrations, we

1000
00:33:33,166 --> 00:33:34,996
always evaluate the capabilities

1001
00:33:34,996 --> 00:33:37,306
of the receiver before deciding

1002
00:33:37,406 --> 00:33:39,546
whether to transcode or not.

1003
00:33:42,976 --> 00:33:44,816
So in summary, there are a few

1004
00:33:44,816 --> 00:33:46,736
points with regards to HEIF and

1005
00:33:46,786 --> 00:33:48,136
HEVC that I'd really like to

1006
00:33:48,806 --> 00:33:48,966
highlight.

1007
00:33:50,256 --> 00:33:52,616
HEVC is Apple's next-generation

1008
00:33:52,616 --> 00:33:54,306
codec, which we're going to use

1009
00:33:54,576 --> 00:33:56,776
for both encoding images and

1010
00:33:56,776 --> 00:33:58,506
videos and is providing up to

1011
00:33:58,506 --> 00:33:59,606
two times the compression

1012
00:33:59,606 --> 00:34:00,856
improvement for Apple captured

1013
00:33:59,606 --> 00:34:00,856
improvement for Apple captured

1014
00:34:00,856 --> 00:34:01,376
content.

1015
00:34:01,896 --> 00:34:05,796
We're adopting HEIF as our image

1016
00:34:05,796 --> 00:34:06,556
file format.

1017
00:34:07,766 --> 00:34:09,295
This image container provides us

1018
00:34:09,295 --> 00:34:10,916
with a flexible format which we

1019
00:34:10,916 --> 00:34:14,255
can use well into the future.

1020
00:34:14,826 --> 00:34:16,696
If you're using Apple frameworks

1021
00:34:16,696 --> 00:34:18,726
within the Apple ecosystem, the

1022
00:34:18,726 --> 00:34:20,966
transition to HEIF and HEVC

1023
00:34:20,966 --> 00:34:22,295
should be mostly transparent.

1024
00:34:22,956 --> 00:34:23,856
But if you need to move that

1025
00:34:23,856 --> 00:34:25,016
content outside of that

1026
00:34:25,016 --> 00:34:26,666
ecosystem, you should consider

1027
00:34:27,136 --> 00:34:28,806
your transcoding options to

1028
00:34:28,806 --> 00:34:30,646
provide the best backwards

1029
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:34,976
compatibility for our users.

1030
00:34:35,096 --> 00:34:36,886
And finally, we really want

1031
00:34:36,886 --> 00:34:39,835
developers to embrace HEIF and

1032
00:34:39,835 --> 00:34:42,016
HEVC for creation and access

1033
00:34:42,076 --> 00:34:43,966
workflows as we believe this

1034
00:34:43,966 --> 00:34:45,565
will provide great benefits to

1035
00:34:45,565 --> 00:34:47,275
not only developers but all of

1036
00:34:47,275 --> 00:34:48,106
our customers.

1037
00:34:48,755 --> 00:34:50,656
So for more details on this

1038
00:34:50,656 --> 00:34:51,826
particular session, you can go

1039
00:34:51,826 --> 00:34:58,376
to the following website, but we

1040
00:34:58,376 --> 00:35:00,756
also have a number of sessions

1041
00:34:58,376 --> 00:35:00,756
also have a number of sessions

1042
00:35:00,756 --> 00:35:01,166
and labs.

1043
00:35:01,306 --> 00:35:02,856
We can learn more about HEIF and

1044
00:35:02,926 --> 00:35:03,216
HEVC.

1045
00:35:03,586 --> 00:35:04,576
Just a few to highlight.

1046
00:35:05,396 --> 00:35:06,586
The session following this is

1047
00:35:06,586 --> 00:35:09,006
advances in HTTP Live Streaming.

1048
00:35:11,936 --> 00:35:13,826
We also have working with HEIF

1049
00:35:13,826 --> 00:35:15,206
and HEVC at 11:00 a.m. on

1050
00:35:15,206 --> 00:35:15,746
Friday.

1051
00:35:17,326 --> 00:35:19,486
We have a great video, which you

1052
00:35:19,486 --> 00:35:21,206
can learn more about the HEIF

1053
00:35:21,646 --> 00:35:22,406
image format.

1054
00:35:23,366 --> 00:35:25,476
Thanks for your time today.

1055
00:35:25,476 --> 00:35:26,676
And we look forward to answering

1056
00:35:26,676 --> 00:35:28,226
your questions at the labs and

1057
00:35:28,226 --> 00:35:29,156
sessions for the rest of the

1058
00:35:29,156 --> 00:35:29,476
week.

1059
00:35:29,736 --> 00:35:30,076
Thank you.
