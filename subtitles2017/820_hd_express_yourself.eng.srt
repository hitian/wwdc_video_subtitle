[ Cheering ]

2
00:00:21,736 --> 00:00:22,746
&gt;&gt; Today I am going to talk

3
00:00:22,746 --> 00:00:23,886
about iMessage apps.

4
00:00:24,166 --> 00:00:25,656
The iMessage App Store is only a

5
00:00:25,656 --> 00:00:27,116
year old, and there are already

6
00:00:27,116 --> 00:00:28,806
so many great apps, and so many

7
00:00:28,806 --> 00:00:29,796
new experiences.

8
00:00:30,116 --> 00:00:31,636
There are also many more yet to

9
00:00:31,636 --> 00:00:32,345
be discovered.

10
00:00:32,606 --> 00:00:33,866
An essential part of the

11
00:00:33,866 --> 00:00:36,006
iMessage App experience is

12
00:00:36,006 --> 00:00:36,486
Stickers.

13
00:00:36,976 --> 00:00:38,556
Stickers have done so much to

14
00:00:38,556 --> 00:00:39,846
brighten our conversations.

15
00:00:40,176 --> 00:00:41,026
There are so many different

16
00:00:41,026 --> 00:00:42,676
types of Stickers, even animated

17
00:00:42,676 --> 00:00:43,066
ones.

18
00:00:43,296 --> 00:00:44,356
Look at all the Stickers here.

19
00:00:44,536 --> 00:00:45,766
And these are only the Apple

20
00:00:45,766 --> 00:00:46,256
ones.

21
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:47,546
Let's take a look at what makes

22
00:00:47,546 --> 00:00:48,166
them so great.

23
00:00:48,616 --> 00:00:50,416
Going to jump into a

24
00:00:50,416 --> 00:00:51,996
conversation, and my friend sent

25
00:00:51,996 --> 00:00:53,386
me this image of a show that we

26
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:53,806
went to.

27
00:00:53,806 --> 00:00:54,536
I'm going to react with a

28
00:00:54,536 --> 00:00:54,966
Sticker.

29
00:00:56,536 --> 00:00:58,086
Going to pick this thumbs-up one

30
00:00:58,086 --> 00:01:00,516
here, tap and hold to peel, and

31
00:00:58,086 --> 00:01:00,516
here, tap and hold to peel, and

32
00:01:00,516 --> 00:01:02,286
put it where I want it, scale,

33
00:01:02,286 --> 00:01:03,706
rotate, and drop it there.

34
00:01:04,215 --> 00:01:05,075
I'm going to add another

35
00:01:05,075 --> 00:01:06,686
Sticker, just to be extra fun

36
00:01:06,686 --> 00:01:07,076
with it.

37
00:01:07,696 --> 00:01:08,416
Pick this one.

38
00:01:08,416 --> 00:01:09,316
And I think I'm going to send

39
00:01:09,316 --> 00:01:10,436
this one with a full screen

40
00:01:10,436 --> 00:01:10,776
effect.

41
00:01:12,136 --> 00:01:13,286
This new echo one that Mac

42
00:01:13,286 --> 00:01:14,046
worked on is great.

43
00:01:16,816 --> 00:01:17,956
What makes the Sticker

44
00:01:17,956 --> 00:01:19,666
experience so effective is that

45
00:01:19,666 --> 00:01:20,146
it's flexible.

46
00:01:20,146 --> 00:01:22,866
With the expandable App drawer,

47
00:01:22,866 --> 00:01:24,256
I can use the half screen and

48
00:01:24,256 --> 00:01:26,186
full screen view to find exactly

49
00:01:26,186 --> 00:01:27,186
the Sticker that I want.

50
00:01:27,386 --> 00:01:28,116
It is fast.

51
00:01:28,336 --> 00:01:29,516
It is easy, and light.

52
00:01:30,536 --> 00:01:32,256
In other words, it's convenient.

53
00:01:34,396 --> 00:01:36,096
Prior to Stickers, you could not

54
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:37,496
respond to an older bubble in

55
00:01:37,496 --> 00:01:38,586
the conversation, and you

56
00:01:38,586 --> 00:01:40,066
definitely couldn't overlay

57
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:41,296
images on top of bubbles.

58
00:01:41,676 --> 00:01:42,726
That is a game changer.

59
00:01:43,086 --> 00:01:44,516
I could pick my Sticker, and put

60
00:01:44,516 --> 00:01:45,796
it exactly where I want it,

61
00:01:46,006 --> 00:01:47,436
transforming the conversation

62
00:01:47,566 --> 00:01:48,716
for both of us to enjoy.

63
00:01:50,916 --> 00:01:53,466
Using Stickers is playful, and

64
00:01:53,466 --> 00:01:53,866
personal.

65
00:01:55,796 --> 00:01:56,936
There are so many different

66
00:01:56,936 --> 00:01:58,266
types of ways to send Stickers,

67
00:01:58,426 --> 00:02:00,106
expressing yourself in unique

68
00:01:58,426 --> 00:02:00,106
expressing yourself in unique

69
00:02:00,106 --> 00:02:01,766
and colorful ways is fun.

70
00:02:03,556 --> 00:02:07,846
That animation is so cool.

71
00:02:07,976 --> 00:02:09,436
We've seen how being convenient,

72
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:11,096
personal and fun are part of

73
00:02:11,096 --> 00:02:12,306
what makes Stickers such a great

74
00:02:12,306 --> 00:02:13,046
experience.

75
00:02:13,846 --> 00:02:15,776
But what works for Stickers can

76
00:02:15,776 --> 00:02:16,926
also work for other apps.

77
00:02:18,386 --> 00:02:19,926
Like expressive apps, sharing

78
00:02:19,926 --> 00:02:21,216
apps, and collaborative apps.

79
00:02:22,286 --> 00:02:23,946
Let's focus on expressive apps.

80
00:02:25,916 --> 00:02:27,356
Here is one that I love.

81
00:02:27,436 --> 00:02:31,176
Tumblr. Tumblr's iOS app is a

82
00:02:31,176 --> 00:02:32,486
social media destination

83
00:02:32,526 --> 00:02:34,266
optimized for sharing photos and

84
00:02:34,266 --> 00:02:35,396
gifts, but that doesn't

85
00:02:35,396 --> 00:02:37,116
necessarily translate into

86
00:02:37,116 --> 00:02:38,646
person to person communication.

87
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:39,826
So they made something

88
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:40,266
different.

89
00:02:40,496 --> 00:02:41,726
They made a GIF generator.

90
00:02:41,726 --> 00:02:44,426
Going to jump into another app

91
00:02:44,426 --> 00:02:45,576
here, and pick a video that I

92
00:02:45,576 --> 00:02:45,886
made.

93
00:02:47,646 --> 00:02:49,436
Cool. I can set the playback

94
00:02:49,436 --> 00:02:51,776
behavior, and speed it up a

95
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:52,836
little bit.

96
00:02:54,256 --> 00:02:55,726
My friend is having a bad day,

97
00:02:55,726 --> 00:02:56,866
so I'm going to send him a fun

98
00:02:56,866 --> 00:02:57,536
little message.

99
00:02:58,336 --> 00:02:59,246
Bounce back, Homey!

100
00:03:01,766 --> 00:03:02,996
I could pick the color.

101
00:03:04,806 --> 00:03:06,296
And change the font.

102
00:03:08,056 --> 00:03:09,596
Scale and rotate.

103
00:03:09,936 --> 00:03:11,156
Get that frog in there, nice.

104
00:03:12,206 --> 00:03:12,856
And send it.

105
00:03:16,236 --> 00:03:16,746
Cool.

106
00:03:18,696 --> 00:03:21,076
Tumblr made a robust GIF editor

107
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:22,746
allowing you to trim your video,

108
00:03:22,746 --> 00:03:24,536
control the play speed, and set

109
00:03:24,536 --> 00:03:25,446
playback behavior.

110
00:03:25,566 --> 00:03:27,716
It is so powerful, and lives

111
00:03:27,716 --> 00:03:28,856
right within messages.

112
00:03:28,856 --> 00:03:30,776
The whole process is lightweight

113
00:03:30,776 --> 00:03:31,516
and convenient.

114
00:03:33,636 --> 00:03:35,526
You can also customize text,

115
00:03:35,586 --> 00:03:37,496
setting the font style, color,

116
00:03:37,496 --> 00:03:39,066
scale and rotation to

117
00:03:39,066 --> 00:03:40,126
personalize your GIF.

118
00:03:40,396 --> 00:03:42,116
All these decisions make your

119
00:03:42,116 --> 00:03:43,966
GIF special for both you and the

120
00:03:43,966 --> 00:03:45,016
person you're sending it to.

121
00:03:49,676 --> 00:03:51,436
And it's fun to see the GIF that

122
00:03:51,436 --> 00:03:53,006
you just created looping in your

123
00:03:53,006 --> 00:03:53,816
conversation.

124
00:03:54,116 --> 00:03:54,996
I know this is going to get a

125
00:03:54,996 --> 00:03:55,736
good reaction.

126
00:03:56,266 --> 00:03:59,736
We've seen how Tumblr has made a

127
00:03:59,736 --> 00:04:01,526
robust, expressive app that is

128
00:03:59,736 --> 00:04:01,526
robust, expressive app that is

129
00:04:01,526 --> 00:04:03,746
so different from Stickers, yet

130
00:04:03,746 --> 00:04:05,296
it maintains the core qualities

131
00:04:05,296 --> 00:04:08,116
of a successful iMessage app.

132
00:04:08,336 --> 00:04:09,276
Let's see how it works for a

133
00:04:09,276 --> 00:04:09,956
sharing app.

134
00:04:10,236 --> 00:04:12,196
Here is an awesome app.

135
00:04:12,376 --> 00:04:13,186
Dunkin Donuts.

136
00:04:15,676 --> 00:04:17,766
Their iOS app is filled with all

137
00:04:17,766 --> 00:04:18,606
kinds of stuff.

138
00:04:18,606 --> 00:04:20,505
You can see your rewards, find

139
00:04:20,505 --> 00:04:22,926
locations, see the menu, order

140
00:04:22,926 --> 00:04:23,356
drinks.

141
00:04:23,766 --> 00:04:24,916
But all these features don't

142
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:26,756
necessarily translate into a

143
00:04:26,756 --> 00:04:28,206
conversational experience.

144
00:04:28,396 --> 00:04:29,816
But one part definitely does.

145
00:04:30,396 --> 00:04:30,956
Gift cards.

146
00:04:30,956 --> 00:04:33,106
Going to go in here.

147
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,586
My friend just helped me move,

148
00:04:34,586 --> 00:04:35,426
so I'm going to send him a gift

149
00:04:35,426 --> 00:04:35,766
card.

150
00:04:36,656 --> 00:04:38,506
And he was kind of lazy, so I'm

151
00:04:38,506 --> 00:04:39,406
only going to send him five

152
00:04:39,406 --> 00:04:39,756
bucks.

153
00:04:40,206 --> 00:04:43,456
Going to pick the right gift

154
00:04:43,456 --> 00:04:43,796
card.

155
00:04:43,796 --> 00:04:44,726
How about "You're one in a

156
00:04:44,726 --> 00:04:45,176
million"?

157
00:04:45,176 --> 00:04:46,206
That is kind of silly, right?

158
00:04:47,096 --> 00:04:49,336
And use the Apple Pay sheet, and

159
00:04:49,336 --> 00:04:50,506
boom, just like that.

160
00:04:50,506 --> 00:04:53,506
I just sent a gift card.

161
00:04:56,846 --> 00:04:58,556
Apple Pay allows you to perform

162
00:04:58,556 --> 00:04:59,856
financial transactions without

163
00:04:59,856 --> 00:05:00,786
leaving messages.

164
00:04:59,856 --> 00:05:00,786
leaving messages.

165
00:05:00,866 --> 00:05:02,106
It is super convenient.

166
00:05:03,496 --> 00:05:05,306
These cards look really nice.

167
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:06,846
Maybe it's your nephew's

168
00:05:06,846 --> 00:05:08,376
graduation or a friend's

169
00:05:08,376 --> 00:05:09,746
birthday, or you want to let

170
00:05:09,746 --> 00:05:10,456
someone know that you're

171
00:05:10,456 --> 00:05:11,196
thinking about them.

172
00:05:11,466 --> 00:05:12,596
Sending a gift card is a great

173
00:05:12,596 --> 00:05:13,166
way to do it.

174
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:14,526
Everyone loves donuts.

175
00:05:16,686 --> 00:05:18,636
And giving is fun.

176
00:05:19,026 --> 00:05:20,056
Being kind is fun.

177
00:05:20,276 --> 00:05:21,466
The person receiving this is

178
00:05:21,466 --> 00:05:22,576
probably going to be really

179
00:05:22,576 --> 00:05:23,176
surprised.

180
00:05:28,276 --> 00:05:30,146
So the Dunkin Donuts app is so

181
00:05:30,146 --> 00:05:31,386
different than Stickers and

182
00:05:31,386 --> 00:05:33,106
Tumblr, it still works well

183
00:05:33,106 --> 00:05:34,206
because it embodies the same

184
00:05:34,206 --> 00:05:34,936
three qualities.

185
00:05:36,896 --> 00:05:38,136
There are also collaborative

186
00:05:38,136 --> 00:05:39,876
apps, like games and polling.

187
00:05:40,656 --> 00:05:42,166
Games and polling rely on both

188
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:44,106
parties to participate, to make

189
00:05:44,106 --> 00:05:45,506
the most of the app experience.

190
00:05:45,616 --> 00:05:46,796
I'm going to share with you one

191
00:05:46,796 --> 00:05:48,266
of my favorite apps.

192
00:05:49,226 --> 00:05:52,586
Tinder. Tinder is a popular

193
00:05:52,586 --> 00:05:53,956
dating app, but you're probably

194
00:05:53,956 --> 00:05:55,386
asking yourself how does a

195
00:05:55,386 --> 00:05:56,556
dating app find its way into

196
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:57,226
messages?

197
00:05:57,336 --> 00:06:00,356
One of the core features of

198
00:05:57,336 --> 00:06:00,356
One of the core features of

199
00:06:00,356 --> 00:06:01,496
Tinder is Stacks.

200
00:06:02,076 --> 00:06:03,316
A data can upload a set of

201
00:06:03,316 --> 00:06:05,396
images, or create a stack, to

202
00:06:05,396 --> 00:06:06,716
attract potential connections.

203
00:06:07,246 --> 00:06:09,786
I am going to go here and create

204
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:10,226
a stack.

205
00:06:10,676 --> 00:06:11,766
I'm having a little personal

206
00:06:11,766 --> 00:06:14,096
crisis today, so maybe my friend

207
00:06:14,096 --> 00:06:14,566
could help me.

208
00:06:14,716 --> 00:06:16,236
I really need to know what shoes

209
00:06:16,236 --> 00:06:17,846
I should wear today.

210
00:06:17,846 --> 00:06:19,986
Going to pick my images, name my

211
00:06:19,986 --> 00:06:25,046
stack, and vote on my own stack.

212
00:06:25,046 --> 00:06:26,376
I really love all of these, so

213
00:06:26,376 --> 00:06:27,976
hopefully I can get some help.

214
00:06:29,626 --> 00:06:30,756
Then I just sent a poll.

215
00:06:33,056 --> 00:06:34,456
Imagine if you had to create a

216
00:06:34,456 --> 00:06:36,566
poll without using this app.

217
00:06:36,566 --> 00:06:37,376
You would have to send these

218
00:06:37,376 --> 00:06:38,756
images individually.

219
00:06:39,046 --> 00:06:40,166
And how would people vote for

220
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:40,436
them?

221
00:06:40,806 --> 00:06:42,676
They would have to say leather

222
00:06:42,676 --> 00:06:43,986
boots, or yellow sneakers.

223
00:06:44,116 --> 00:06:45,306
But here, they could just cast

224
00:06:45,306 --> 00:06:45,806
their vote.

225
00:06:46,256 --> 00:06:47,806
Making polls with Tinder is so

226
00:06:47,806 --> 00:06:48,286
easy.

227
00:06:48,576 --> 00:06:50,596
I have the Tinder app just so I

228
00:06:50,596 --> 00:06:51,516
could use this feature

229
00:06:52,016 --> 00:06:54,526
[laughter].

230
00:06:55,026 --> 00:06:56,646
Taking a poll is personal.

231
00:06:56,706 --> 00:06:57,956
You're sharing a personal set of

232
00:06:57,956 --> 00:07:01,006
images, selfies, sneakers, food,

233
00:06:57,956 --> 00:07:01,006
images, selfies, sneakers, food,

234
00:07:01,006 --> 00:07:02,586
or whatever, you're asking a

235
00:07:02,586 --> 00:07:04,166
trusted person for their opinion

236
00:07:04,366 --> 00:07:04,976
because you care.

237
00:07:07,996 --> 00:07:08,516
And it's fun.

238
00:07:08,516 --> 00:07:10,186
It's fun to pick people's

239
00:07:10,186 --> 00:07:10,636
brains.

240
00:07:10,836 --> 00:07:12,836
It's fun to agree and disagree.

241
00:07:13,206 --> 00:07:14,816
The poll evolves as people vote,

242
00:07:14,816 --> 00:07:16,476
and becomes an enjoyable event

243
00:07:16,476 --> 00:07:17,036
for everyone.

244
00:07:18,876 --> 00:07:20,346
So whether you're making a

245
00:07:20,346 --> 00:07:23,036
sticker pack, a GIF generator, a

246
00:07:23,036 --> 00:07:24,726
gifting experience, or an image

247
00:07:24,726 --> 00:07:27,836
poll, making them convenient,

248
00:07:27,836 --> 00:07:29,956
personal and fun can make a huge

249
00:07:29,956 --> 00:07:31,336
difference in the success of

250
00:07:31,336 --> 00:07:31,926
your app.

251
00:07:35,126 --> 00:07:36,166
Here are some tips to get

252
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:36,666
started.

253
00:07:38,096 --> 00:07:40,426
Tumblr, Dunkin Donuts and Tinder

254
00:07:40,426 --> 00:07:41,616
do not set out to put their

255
00:07:41,616 --> 00:07:43,646
entire apps into messages, and

256
00:07:43,646 --> 00:07:44,616
thankfully they didn't.

257
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:46,396
They integrated only features

258
00:07:46,506 --> 00:07:47,246
that were focused on

259
00:07:47,246 --> 00:07:47,996
communication.

260
00:07:50,206 --> 00:07:52,206
Handcrafted messages are fun to

261
00:07:52,206 --> 00:07:53,146
send and receive.

262
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:54,926
Find ways to let your users

263
00:07:54,926 --> 00:07:56,156
create and customize the

264
00:07:56,156 --> 00:07:56,916
experience.

265
00:07:57,276 --> 00:07:58,586
You may find that there are ways

266
00:07:58,586 --> 00:07:59,826
to use your app that you never

267
00:07:59,826 --> 00:08:00,596
even imagined.

268
00:07:59,826 --> 00:08:00,596
even imagined.

269
00:08:01,116 --> 00:08:02,826
You may discover new user bases,

270
00:08:03,096 --> 00:08:04,366
like my experience with Tinder.

271
00:08:07,646 --> 00:08:09,096
There are so many platform

272
00:08:09,096 --> 00:08:10,966
tools, peel and place stickers,

273
00:08:10,966 --> 00:08:12,866
Apple Pay sheet, access to the

274
00:08:12,866 --> 00:08:14,656
microphone, camera and photos.

275
00:08:14,986 --> 00:08:16,066
Think about what is best for

276
00:08:16,066 --> 00:08:17,626
your app, and improve on an

277
00:08:17,626 --> 00:08:19,336
existing experience, or create a

278
00:08:19,336 --> 00:08:19,796
new one.

279
00:08:21,386 --> 00:08:23,276
Because in the end, you want to

280
00:08:23,276 --> 00:08:24,866
create a wonderful experience

281
00:08:25,026 --> 00:08:26,376
for your family and friends.

282
00:08:27,676 --> 00:08:28,356
Thank you.
