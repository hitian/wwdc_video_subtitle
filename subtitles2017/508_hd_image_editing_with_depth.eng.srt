00:00:29,576 --> 00:00:30,966
And I'm happy to be here today

5
00:00:31,176 --> 00:00:33,526
to show you how you can use

6
00:00:33,586 --> 00:00:35,166
depth to apply new kind of

7
00:00:35,226 --> 00:00:36,696
effects to your images.

8
00:00:38,666 --> 00:00:40,866
First, we're going to see what

9
00:00:40,936 --> 00:00:42,726
depth is and what it looks like.

10
00:00:43,316 --> 00:00:44,936
Then we're going to see how to

11
00:00:44,936 --> 00:00:46,536
load it and read it from our

12
00:00:46,536 --> 00:00:47,256
image files.

13
00:00:48,356 --> 00:00:49,826
And then we're going to show you

14
00:00:50,156 --> 00:00:52,546
several examples of effects you

15
00:00:52,546 --> 00:00:53,866
can achieve with depth.

16
00:00:54,486 --> 00:00:56,456
And we'll conclude with how to

17
00:00:56,456 --> 00:00:57,286
save depth data.

18
00:00:58,746 --> 00:00:59,006
All right.

19
00:00:59,266 --> 00:00:59,966
So let's get started.

20
00:01:01,536 --> 00:01:03,306
What is depth?

21
00:01:03,956 --> 00:01:05,296
So, to answer that question,

22
00:01:05,626 --> 00:01:07,486
let's start with how we capture

23
00:01:07,486 --> 00:01:07,796
depth.

24
00:01:10,806 --> 00:01:13,396
Depth can be captured only on

25
00:01:14,026 --> 00:01:17,066
iPhone 7+ and only on iOS 11.

26
00:01:18,106 --> 00:01:22,006
iPhone 7+ has a dual camera

27
00:01:22,006 --> 00:01:24,116
system that can be set to

28
00:01:24,116 --> 00:01:25,856
capture two images of the same

29
00:01:25,856 --> 00:01:27,846
scene at the same time and at

30
00:01:27,846 --> 00:01:28,756
the same focal length.

31
00:01:29,476 --> 00:01:32,046
The differences between those

32
00:01:32,046 --> 00:01:34,236
two images is called disparity.

33
00:01:35,766 --> 00:01:38,146
So disparity is a measure of the

34
00:01:38,146 --> 00:01:39,006
parallax effect.

35
00:01:39,416 --> 00:01:41,596
It measures how objects that are

36
00:01:41,596 --> 00:01:43,496
closer to the camera tends to

37
00:01:43,496 --> 00:01:47,646
move, to shift more from one

38
00:01:47,646 --> 00:01:49,516
image to the other.

39
00:01:49,796 --> 00:01:51,636
Once we know disparity, we can

40
00:01:51,636 --> 00:01:53,826
compute depth with a simple

41
00:01:54,056 --> 00:01:54,446
formula.

42
00:01:55,476 --> 00:01:57,326
Depth is 1 over disparity.

43
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:01,506
So, in the remaining of this

44
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:01,506
So, in the remaining of this

45
00:02:01,506 --> 00:02:02,626
session we're going to talk

46
00:02:02,626 --> 00:02:04,676
about depth or disparity under

47
00:02:04,676 --> 00:02:06,476
the broad term of depth data.

48
00:02:06,966 --> 00:02:09,145
But remember, they're pretty

49
00:02:09,145 --> 00:02:11,806
similar and one is the inverse

50
00:02:11,806 --> 00:02:13,686
of the other.

51
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:16,216
For more information about how

52
00:02:16,216 --> 00:02:18,106
we capture depth I would refer

53
00:02:18,106 --> 00:02:20,626
you to the session on capturing

54
00:02:20,626 --> 00:02:22,146
depth in iPhone photography that

55
00:02:22,146 --> 00:02:22,896
took place yesterday.

56
00:02:23,996 --> 00:02:25,016
All right.

57
00:02:26,986 --> 00:02:28,516
So now that we know what depth

58
00:02:28,516 --> 00:02:30,666
and disparity looks like --

59
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:32,306

00:02:32,306 --> 00:02:33,446
depth and disparity is, let's

take a look at what it looks

62
00:02:34,566 --> 00:02:35,396
like in practice.

63
00:02:35,796 --> 00:02:36,966
And for that, I'm going to call

&gt;&gt; Thank you, Etienne.

69
00:02:49,036 --> 00:02:50,586
What we're seeing here is an

70
00:02:50,586 --> 00:02:51,916
image that was captured by the

71
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:53,106

00:02:55,336 --> 00:02:56,806
And here is its disparity map.

73
00:02:57,096 --> 00:02:59,816
And as we've learned, disparity

74
00:03:00,776 --> 00:03:03,126
refers to the distance between

75
00:03:03,126 --> 00:03:04,576
two corresponding points that

76
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:06,396
were captured by the iPhone 7+'s

77
00:03:06,396 --> 00:03:07,576
dual camera system.

78
00:03:09,116 --> 00:03:11,286
Bright areas are closer to the

79
00:03:11,286 --> 00:03:14,226
camera and correspond to higher

80
00:03:14,226 --> 00:03:15,286
disparity values.

81
00:03:15,706 --> 00:03:18,196
Where dark values are farther

82
00:03:18,196 --> 00:03:19,166
away from the camera and

83
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:20,446
correspond to low disparity

84
00:03:20,446 --> 00:03:20,956
values.

85
00:03:22,926 --> 00:03:24,206
So, let's go back to the image

86
00:03:24,726 --> 00:03:26,476
and look at the disparity map

88
00:03:27,876 --> 00:03:29,666

00:03:30,046 --> 00:03:31,636

91
00:03:31,636 --> 00:03:32,946
can do with this application.

95
00:03:43,326 --> 00:03:45,146

00:03:45,146 --> 00:03:47,896
good look at the range of data

97
00:03:47,896 --> 00:03:49,096
that's available to us.

98
00:03:49,096 --> 00:03:50,536
We can rotate all the way around

99
00:03:50,786 --> 00:03:51,806
and look at that again.

100
00:03:52,116 --> 00:03:54,706
And even switch back to the

101

image data overlaid over top of

102
00:03:56,956 --> 00:03:57,026

103

Here are some beautiful flowers.

106
00:04:06,316 --> 00:04:08,446
When I zoom in and rotate

107
00:04:08,446 --> 00:04:11,516
around, you see that we need to

108
00:04:11,516 --> 00:04:13,466
fill in those polygons with some

109
00:04:13,466 --> 00:04:13,856
data.

110
00:04:13,856 --> 00:04:15,486
So we just take the image values

111
00:04:15,486 --> 00:04:16,696
and stretch them along there.

112
00:04:17,946 --> 00:04:19,846
This goes to the fact that the

113
00:04:19,846 --> 00:04:21,616
depth data is not a good

114
00:04:21,616 --> 00:04:23,816
representation for recreating a

117
00:04:26,716 --> 00:04:29,246
interesting to look at.

118
00:04:29,486 --> 00:04:30,696
Also, it's important to note

119
00:04:30,786 --> 00:04:32,496
that the disparity map is a

120
00:04:32,496 --> 00:04:34,356
lower resolution than the full

121
00:04:34,356 --> 00:04:36,156
image, roughly a half a

122
00:04:36,156 --> 00:04:38,116
megapixel for the disparity map

123
00:04:38,116 --> 00:04:39,446
versus 12 megapixels for the

124
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:39,886
image.

00:04:41,836 --> 00:04:43,216

SceneKit.

127
00:04:43,946 --> 00:04:45,186

implement.

129
00:04:46,186 --> 00:04:48,066
We took a mesh and then we

130
00:04:48,066 --> 00:04:50,376
transformed the z positions of

131
00:04:50,376 --> 00:04:52,176
the vertices so that the

132
00:04:52,176 --> 00:04:53,496
brighter pixel values were

133
00:04:53,496 --> 00:04:54,576
closer to the camera.

134
00:04:55,886 --> 00:04:57,526
Also, we normalized and remapped

135
00:04:57,526 --> 00:04:58,936
the data so that it made sense

136
00:04:58,936 --> 00:05:00,096
when we viewed it in 3-D.

137

We'll look at one more image.

139
00:05:04,936 --> 00:05:06,576
On this image, it's interesting

140
00:05:06,576 --> 00:05:08,066
if we look at the disparity map.

141
00:05:08,706 --> 00:05:11,106
And we zoom in and move around a

142
00:05:11,106 --> 00:05:12,316
little bit, we see that we have

143
00:05:12,316 --> 00:05:13,866
a few distinct planes to work

144
00:05:13,866 --> 00:05:14,336
with here.

145
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:17,166
So, with that, we might get the

146
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:18,316
idea that maybe it would be a

147
00:05:18,316 --> 00:05:19,696
good idea to quantize or

148
00:05:19,696 --> 00:05:21,376
threshold this depth data before

149
00:05:21,376 --> 00:05:22,836
we filter it for a more dramatic

150
00:05:22,836 --> 00:05:23,156
effect.

151
00:05:24,346 --> 00:05:26,106

00:05:26,106 --> 00:05:27,256

So now that we've seen what

depth and disparity looks like,

158
00:05:41,336 --> 00:05:42,896
what kind of effects can we

159
00:05:42,896 --> 00:05:44,606
apply with that data?

160
00:05:45,246 --> 00:05:46,116
So let's take a look.

161
00:05:47,016 --> 00:05:49,226
Here's an example image and its

162
00:05:49,276 --> 00:05:49,986
disparity map.

163
00:05:52,706 --> 00:05:54,426
One effect we can apply is a

164
00:05:54,426 --> 00:05:55,286
depth blur effect.

165
00:05:55,616 --> 00:05:57,376
And this is the effect that you

166
00:05:57,376 --> 00:05:59,606
can achieve by capturing using

167
00:05:59,606 --> 00:06:00,916
camera in portrait mode.

168
00:05:59,606 --> 00:06:00,916

169
00:06:03,746 --> 00:06:05,246
We can get a bit more creative.

170
00:06:05,316 --> 00:06:06,856
And here's an example where we

171
00:06:06,856 --> 00:06:08,556
apply a different effect to the

172
00:06:08,556 --> 00:06:09,896
background and the foreground.

173
00:06:10,526 --> 00:06:12,466
Here we dissipate the background

174
00:06:12,806 --> 00:06:14,256
while increasing the saturation

175
00:06:14,256 --> 00:06:15,956
of the foreground to make those

176
00:06:15,956 --> 00:06:16,796
flowers stand out.

177
00:06:19,356 --> 00:06:20,886
We can go even further than

178
00:06:20,886 --> 00:06:21,176
this.

179
00:06:21,516 --> 00:06:23,356
And here we are actually the

180
00:06:23,356 --> 00:06:24,676
deeming the pixels in the

181
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:26,686
background proportionally to the

182
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:27,176
depth.

183
00:06:28,366 --> 00:06:30,716
And so this is just a couple of

184
00:06:30,716 --> 00:06:32,366
examples to give you a taste of

185
00:06:32,366 --> 00:06:34,056
what you can do with that data.

186

now use depth to create new

194
00:06:48,536 --> 00:06:50,116
kinds of effects and to apply

195
00:06:50,116 --> 00:06:51,226
new kinds of effects to your

196
00:06:51,226 --> 00:06:51,706
images.

197
00:06:52,906 --> 00:06:53,686
But if you're a camera

198
00:06:53,756 --> 00:06:55,746
application, you can also opt in

199
00:06:55,746 --> 00:06:58,646
to capture depth and be the very

200
00:06:58,646 --> 00:07:00,226
first -- apply the very first

201
00:06:58,646 --> 00:07:00,226
first -- apply the very first

202
00:07:00,226 --> 00:07:01,896
depth effect to the images such

203
00:07:01,896 --> 00:07:03,246
as your own depth blur effects,

204
00:07:03,246 --> 00:07:03,776
for example.

205
00:07:05,026 --> 00:07:06,286
If you are a sharing

206
00:07:06,286 --> 00:07:07,656
application, you may also want

207
00:07:07,656 --> 00:07:09,706
to take advantage of depth to

208
00:07:09,706 --> 00:07:11,906
apply cool effects before

209
00:07:12,216 --> 00:07:13,156
sharing images.

210
00:07:14,246 --> 00:07:15,076
All right.

211
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:17,256
But before we can apply any

212
00:07:17,256 --> 00:07:18,556
effects, let's take a look at

213
00:07:18,556 --> 00:07:20,696
how to read depth data and load

214
00:07:20,696 --> 00:07:21,386
it into memory.

215
00:07:23,806 --> 00:07:24,706
So let's take a look.

216
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:27,996
Depth data is stored in image

217
00:07:27,996 --> 00:07:30,506
files alongside image data in a

218
00:07:30,506 --> 00:07:34,166
section called Auxiliary Data.

219
00:07:34,856 --> 00:07:37,826
Beware that the values image

220
00:07:37,826 --> 00:07:39,346
[inaudible] in the system such

221
00:07:39,346 --> 00:07:40,556
as UI image and [inaudible]

222
00:07:40,586 --> 00:07:41,546
image or [inaudible] image do

223
00:07:41,736 --> 00:07:43,256
not contain depth information.

224
00:07:44,136 --> 00:07:45,496
You need to access the image

225
00:07:45,496 --> 00:07:47,056
file in order to read the depth

226
00:07:47,056 --> 00:07:47,326
data.

227
00:07:48,026 --> 00:07:49,196
So let's see how to do that.

228
00:07:50,116 --> 00:07:51,306
If you're using PhotoKit,

229
00:07:52,336 --> 00:07:53,406
there's a couple of ways to can

230
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:54,516
access the image file.

231
00:07:55,096 --> 00:07:57,116
You may be using PH Content

232
00:07:57,116 --> 00:08:00,036
Editing input, for instance.

233
00:07:57,116 --> 00:08:00,036
Editing input, for instance.

234
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:02,196
Here's how you can request the

235
00:08:02,196 --> 00:08:03,316
Content Editing input for a

236
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,586
particular PHAsset.

237
00:08:05,856 --> 00:08:07,556
And you can access the image

238
00:08:07,656 --> 00:08:09,186
file URL from the Content

239
00:08:09,186 --> 00:08:10,186
Editing input that way.

240
00:08:12,966 --> 00:08:14,406
You may also use PH Image

241
00:08:14,406 --> 00:08:14,886
Manager.

242
00:08:15,206 --> 00:08:18,776
You can ask the PH Image Manager

243
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:20,366
to request image data for a

244
00:08:20,366 --> 00:08:21,306
particular asset.

245
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:22,996
And that will give you back a

246
00:08:22,996 --> 00:08:25,256
data object that contains the

247
00:08:25,256 --> 00:08:25,836
file data.

248
00:08:27,826 --> 00:08:28,286
All right.

249
00:08:29,276 --> 00:08:30,716
So now that we have access to a

250
00:08:30,716 --> 00:08:32,426
file, let's see if it contained

251
00:08:32,426 --> 00:08:32,905
depth data.

252
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:34,025
And so we're going to use

253
00:08:34,025 --> 00:08:34,976
ImageIO for this.

254
00:08:37,436 --> 00:08:38,816
We start from an image source

255
00:08:38,816 --> 00:08:40,216
that we create from our image

256
00:08:40,216 --> 00:08:40,576
file.

257
00:08:41,936 --> 00:08:45,786
And then we copy the image

258
00:08:45,786 --> 00:08:46,626
source properties.

259
00:08:47,576 --> 00:08:48,706
This will give you back a

260
00:08:48,706 --> 00:08:50,706
dictionary that looks like this

261
00:08:50,706 --> 00:08:50,996
one.

262
00:08:52,526 --> 00:08:54,086
You want to look for the

263
00:08:54,086 --> 00:08:56,276
kCKImage Property Auxiliary data

264
00:08:56,796 --> 00:08:58,106
key in that dictionary.

265
00:08:58,416 --> 00:09:00,146
The presence of that key will

266
00:08:58,416 --> 00:09:00,146
The presence of that key will

267
00:09:00,146 --> 00:09:02,086
tell you that image file that

268
00:09:02,086 --> 00:09:03,266
you're working with contained

269
00:09:03,266 --> 00:09:03,966
auxiliary data.

270
00:09:05,296 --> 00:09:06,916
You can look at the type of the

271
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:07,276
data.

272
00:09:07,276 --> 00:09:08,586
And here you can see its

273
00:09:08,586 --> 00:09:09,156
disparity.

274
00:09:09,596 --> 00:09:10,486
Could also be depth.

275
00:09:11,606 --> 00:09:13,556
One thing to note here is that

276
00:09:13,556 --> 00:09:15,016
the dimension of the depth data

277
00:09:15,696 --> 00:09:17,686
are smaller than the dimension

278
00:09:17,896 --> 00:09:19,036
of the full size image.

279
00:09:20,176 --> 00:09:21,476
This is an image captured by

280
00:09:21,476 --> 00:09:22,406
iPhone 7+.

281
00:09:22,556 --> 00:09:24,036
The full size image is 12

282
00:09:24,036 --> 00:09:24,716
megapixel.

283
00:09:25,206 --> 00:09:27,946
And the depth data is about less

284
00:09:28,176 --> 00:09:29,706
than a megapixel.

285
00:09:31,316 --> 00:09:32,836
All right.

286
00:09:34,126 --> 00:09:35,666
So now that we know that we have

287
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:37,186
a file with depth data, let's

288
00:09:37,186 --> 00:09:42,026
see how we can read it

289
00:09:42,026 --> 00:09:43,516
[inaudible].

290
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:44,826
So, it goes like this.

291
00:09:44,826 --> 00:09:46,186
We start with the auxiliary data

292
00:09:46,186 --> 00:09:46,846
from the file.

293
00:09:48,026 --> 00:09:49,516
And then we create an AV Depth

294
00:09:49,516 --> 00:09:50,736
Data object, which is a

295
00:09:50,736 --> 00:09:51,276
[inaudible] memory

296
00:09:51,276 --> 00:09:52,856
representation for the depth

297
00:09:52,856 --> 00:09:53,146
data.

298
00:09:54,346 --> 00:09:56,736
From that object we can access a

299
00:09:56,736 --> 00:09:58,956
CV pixel buffer that contains

300
00:09:58,956 --> 00:09:59,626
the depth data.

301
00:10:01,276 --> 00:10:02,676
The pixel buffer will be a

302
00:10:02,676 --> 00:10:04,146
single channel of data

303
00:10:05,046 --> 00:10:06,786
containing either depth or

304
00:10:06,786 --> 00:10:09,486
disparity and in 16-bit or

305
00:10:09,486 --> 00:10:10,786
32-bit floating [inaudible]

306
00:10:10,786 --> 00:10:11,336
values.

307
00:10:11,806 --> 00:10:11,966
All right.

308
00:10:12,676 --> 00:10:16,046
So let's see how to do that in

309
00:10:16,046 --> 00:10:16,376
code.

310
00:10:18,246 --> 00:10:19,686
Again we start from [inaudible].

311
00:10:21,426 --> 00:10:23,806
And next we ask to copy the

312
00:10:23,806 --> 00:10:25,646
auxiliary data out of the image

313
00:10:25,646 --> 00:10:25,713
[inaudible].

314
00:10:25,713 --> 00:10:27,636
So for that we request a

315
00:10:27,636 --> 00:10:29,846
particular auxiliary data type.

316
00:10:30,276 --> 00:10:31,306
Here we are requesting

317
00:10:31,306 --> 00:10:31,886
disparity.

318
00:10:32,856 --> 00:10:34,096
And this give us back a

319
00:10:34,096 --> 00:10:35,826
dictionary that contains the

320
00:10:35,826 --> 00:10:36,606
auxiliary data.

321
00:10:38,026 --> 00:10:39,156
It can also return the

322
00:10:39,736 --> 00:10:40,256
[inaudible], and that will

323
00:10:40,256 --> 00:10:41,956
indicate that the image file

324
00:10:41,956 --> 00:10:44,006
does not contain the disparity

325
00:10:44,006 --> 00:10:45,896
-- sorry, the auxiliary data of

326
00:10:45,896 --> 00:10:46,766
that particular type.

327
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:48,436
So that's another way you can

328
00:10:48,436 --> 00:10:50,486
check if a file contains depth

329
00:10:50,486 --> 00:10:50,756
data.

330
00:10:53,536 --> 00:10:55,746
Next, we can create an AVDepth

331
00:10:55,746 --> 00:10:57,416
Data object from the auxiliary

332
00:10:57,416 --> 00:10:59,466
data, the representation that we

333
00:10:59,466 --> 00:11:00,486
got from ImageIO.

334
00:10:59,466 --> 00:11:00,486
got from ImageIO.

335
00:11:02,006 --> 00:11:03,516
And that AVDepth Data contains a

336
00:11:03,516 --> 00:11:04,676
couple of properties that you

337
00:11:04,676 --> 00:11:05,196
can ask.

338
00:11:05,196 --> 00:11:06,966
For example, you can check for

339
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:09,016
its native data type.

340
00:11:09,526 --> 00:11:11,616
And that's a pixel format that

341
00:11:11,616 --> 00:11:12,306
you can check.

342
00:11:12,306 --> 00:11:13,956
And if it's not the one you

343
00:11:13,956 --> 00:11:16,906
want, you can also convert it to

344
00:11:16,906 --> 00:11:19,016
a new pixel format.

345
00:11:19,046 --> 00:11:22,156
So for example, here we ask for

346
00:11:22,156 --> 00:11:23,486
disparity float 16.

347
00:11:23,486 --> 00:11:24,866
Because maybe we're going to use

348
00:11:24,866 --> 00:11:26,436
a disparity map on the GPU, for

349
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:26,856
example.

350
00:11:27,776 --> 00:11:30,216
And this will return a new AV

351
00:11:30,216 --> 00:11:31,506
Depth Data object of the right

352
00:11:31,506 --> 00:11:31,926
format.

353
00:11:32,706 --> 00:11:34,376
So once you have a depth data

354
00:11:34,376 --> 00:11:35,626
object that you're happy with,

355
00:11:35,656 --> 00:11:37,886
you can access a CV pixel buffer

356
00:11:38,226 --> 00:11:39,416
using the depth data map

357
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:39,836
property.

358
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:42,366
Once you have the CV pixel

359
00:11:42,366 --> 00:11:43,906
buffer you can use it directly.

360
00:11:43,906 --> 00:11:45,726
Or you can use it using Metal or

361
00:11:45,726 --> 00:11:46,246
Core Image.

362
00:11:47,526 --> 00:11:48,566
If you're working with Core

363
00:11:48,566 --> 00:11:50,626
Image, there's a convenient way

364
00:11:50,766 --> 00:11:52,476
you can load the depth data

365
00:11:52,476 --> 00:11:53,856
directly into a CI Image.

366
00:11:54,076 --> 00:11:54,976
Here's how to do it.

367
00:11:55,976 --> 00:11:57,986
When you create a CI Image from

368
00:11:57,986 --> 00:11:59,556
the contents of a file, you can

369
00:11:59,556 --> 00:12:01,596
now specify a new option such as

370
00:11:59,556 --> 00:12:01,596
now specify a new option such as

371
00:12:01,986 --> 00:12:05,566
kCGIImage auxiliary depth or

372
00:12:05,566 --> 00:12:09,246
disparity to indicate to CI to

373
00:12:09,246 --> 00:12:10,856
load the depth data -- the depth

374
00:12:10,856 --> 00:12:12,116
image instead of the regular

375
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:12,526
image.

376
00:12:14,106 --> 00:12:16,806
Once you have a depth image, you

377
00:12:16,806 --> 00:12:18,286
can always go back to the AV

378
00:12:18,286 --> 00:12:20,266
Depth data object by call its

379
00:12:20,266 --> 00:12:21,266
depth data property.

380
00:12:23,286 --> 00:12:24,416
And keep in mind that you can

381
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:26,326
always convert back and forth

382
00:12:26,326 --> 00:12:27,706
between disparity and depth

383
00:12:27,856 --> 00:12:29,776
using convenient UCI filters

384
00:12:30,016 --> 00:12:33,476
such as CI depth to disparity.

385
00:12:34,776 --> 00:12:35,136
All right.

386
00:12:35,306 --> 00:12:37,196
So now that we've read the depth

387
00:12:37,336 --> 00:12:39,796
data out of a file and into an

388
00:12:39,796 --> 00:12:42,096
image, let's see -- we still

389
00:12:42,236 --> 00:12:44,436
need to take a couple more step

390
00:12:44,436 --> 00:12:45,726
before we can start editing with

391
00:12:45,726 --> 00:12:45,906
it.

392
00:12:46,086 --> 00:12:49,276
If you remember, the depth data

393
00:12:49,276 --> 00:12:50,706
is lower resolution than the

394
00:12:50,706 --> 00:12:51,196
image.

395
00:12:51,616 --> 00:12:53,606
So, the very first thing that

396
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,166
you want to do is to scale it up

397
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:57,196
to the resolution of the image

398
00:12:57,196 --> 00:12:57,966
that you're working with.

399
00:12:58,536 --> 00:12:59,596
There's a couple ways to do

400
00:12:59,596 --> 00:12:59,826
that.

401
00:12:59,826 --> 00:13:01,866
So, let's take a look.

402
00:12:59,826 --> 00:13:01,866
So, let's take a look.

403
00:13:02,556 --> 00:13:04,846
Here's our example image and its

404
00:13:04,846 --> 00:13:05,766
disparity map.

405
00:13:06,526 --> 00:13:08,436
So, if we scale up, let's say

406
00:13:08,436 --> 00:13:10,726
this small, tiny portion there,

407
00:13:10,816 --> 00:13:12,826
using narrow sampling, you can

408
00:13:12,826 --> 00:13:13,716
see that it's very, very

409
00:13:13,716 --> 00:13:14,336
pixelated.

410
00:13:14,716 --> 00:13:16,006
So at the very least you would

411
00:13:16,006 --> 00:13:17,496
want to apply linear sampling to

412
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:18,636
get the smoother result.

413
00:13:19,926 --> 00:13:22,096
You can also use a new CI filter

414
00:13:22,446 --> 00:13:25,236
to CI BiCubicScale Transform to

415
00:13:25,236 --> 00:13:27,936
get an even smoother result.

416
00:13:28,946 --> 00:13:31,326
However, beware that depth data

417
00:13:31,326 --> 00:13:32,206
is not color data.

418
00:13:32,886 --> 00:13:34,896
And so, instead of smoothing,

419
00:13:34,896 --> 00:13:36,476
maybe what you want is actually

420
00:13:36,476 --> 00:13:38,686
preserve as much as possible the

421
00:13:38,686 --> 00:13:41,216
details of the image so that the

422
00:13:41,216 --> 00:13:42,786
depth data matches the image

423
00:13:42,786 --> 00:13:43,436
more closely.

424
00:13:43,836 --> 00:13:44,796
And you can do this with a

425
00:13:44,796 --> 00:13:46,926
convenient CI filter called CI

426
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:48,636
Edge Preserve Upsample Filter.

427
00:13:49,966 --> 00:13:52,206
This filter will upsample the

428
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:54,226
depth data and will try to

429
00:13:54,226 --> 00:13:56,686
preserve the edges from the

430
00:13:56,926 --> 00:13:58,156
color image.

431
00:13:59,576 --> 00:14:00,506
All right.

432
00:13:59,576 --> 00:14:00,506
All right.

433
00:14:01,786 --> 00:14:04,106
Oh, also another thing that you

434
00:14:04,106 --> 00:14:05,836
need to be careful of.

435
00:14:06,026 --> 00:14:07,466
For all of those resampling

436
00:14:07,466 --> 00:14:09,456
operation, we recommend that you

437
00:14:09,456 --> 00:14:11,336
use disparity over depth because

438
00:14:11,336 --> 00:14:12,736
it gives you -- it will give you

439
00:14:12,736 --> 00:14:13,546
better results.

440
00:14:15,056 --> 00:14:17,826
Okay. A couple thing that you

441
00:14:17,826 --> 00:14:18,886
may want to do as well.

442
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:21,836
You may want to compute the

443
00:14:21,836 --> 00:14:23,786
minimum and maximum value for

444
00:14:23,786 --> 00:14:24,446
the depth data.

445
00:14:26,056 --> 00:14:28,186
Because there are many cases

446
00:14:28,186 --> 00:14:29,116
where you need to know those

447
00:14:29,116 --> 00:14:30,486
values for the particular

448
00:14:30,486 --> 00:14:32,346
effects that you want to apply.

449
00:14:34,806 --> 00:14:36,066
Also keep in mind that the depth

450
00:14:36,066 --> 00:14:37,996
data is not normalized between 0

451
00:14:37,996 --> 00:14:39,016
and 1.

452
00:14:39,016 --> 00:14:41,296
For example, disparity values

453
00:14:41,296 --> 00:14:43,326
can range from 0, which means

454
00:14:43,676 --> 00:14:48,906
infinity, to greater than 1 for

455
00:14:48,906 --> 00:14:51,016
objects that are closer than one

456
00:14:51,016 --> 00:14:51,706
meter away.

457
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:58,056
Okay. Another thing you can do

458
00:14:58,056 --> 00:14:59,346
is to normalize the depth data.

459
00:14:59,346 --> 00:15:00,546
So once you know the min and max

460
00:14:59,346 --> 00:15:00,546
So once you know the min and max

461
00:15:00,546 --> 00:15:02,316
you can normalize the depth or

462
00:15:02,316 --> 00:15:03,786
disparity between 0 and 1.

463
00:15:04,086 --> 00:15:05,246
And that's pretty convenient

464
00:15:05,466 --> 00:15:07,446
first to visualize it.

465
00:15:07,836 --> 00:15:10,426
But also if you want to apply

466
00:15:10,426 --> 00:15:12,396
your depth effects consistently

467
00:15:12,396 --> 00:15:14,036
across various different scenes.

468
00:15:14,886 --> 00:15:15,226
All right.

469
00:15:15,226 --> 00:15:17,276
So now that we've read our depth

470
00:15:17,276 --> 00:15:18,886
data, and prepared it for

471
00:15:18,886 --> 00:15:20,396
editing we are ready to start

472
00:15:20,396 --> 00:15:21,126
filtering with it.

473
00:15:23,096 --> 00:15:24,546
So in this section we're going

474
00:15:24,546 --> 00:15:26,546
to show you several example of

475
00:15:26,706 --> 00:15:28,406
depth effects you can apply.

476
00:15:29,236 --> 00:15:30,696
We're going to start with simple

477
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:31,956
background effects that you can

478
00:15:31,956 --> 00:15:34,106
achieve using built in Core

479
00:15:34,106 --> 00:15:34,926
Image filters.

480
00:15:35,736 --> 00:15:37,996
Then we're going to show you a

481
00:15:37,996 --> 00:15:39,486
custom depth effect that you can

482
00:15:39,486 --> 00:15:41,446
achieve using a custom CI

483
00:15:41,696 --> 00:15:42,116
[inaudible] code.

484
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:45,396
Then we're going to show you how

485
00:15:45,396 --> 00:15:46,546
you can apply your own depth

486
00:15:46,546 --> 00:15:48,216
blur effect using a brand new CI

487
00:15:48,216 --> 00:15:48,506
Filter.

488
00:15:49,726 --> 00:15:51,196
And finally, we're going to show

489
00:15:51,196 --> 00:15:52,996
you how to create a brand new

490
00:15:52,996 --> 00:15:54,966
3-D effect using depth.

491
00:15:55,376 --> 00:15:56,516
So let's get started with the

492
00:15:56,516 --> 00:15:57,026
first one.

493
00:15:57,596 --> 00:15:58,696
And for that I'm going to call

494
00:15:58,696 --> 00:16:00,276
my colleague Stephen on stage

495
00:15:58,696 --> 00:16:00,276
my colleague Stephen on stage

496
00:16:00,276 --> 00:16:00,736
for that demo.

497
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:01,746
Stephen.

498
00:16:03,516 --> 00:16:06,686
[ Applause ]

499
00:16:07,186 --> 00:16:07,836
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Etienne.

500
00:16:08,626 --> 00:16:09,396
Good morning everybody.

501
00:16:09,396 --> 00:16:10,296
My name is Stephen.

502
00:16:10,296 --> 00:16:12,176
And now that Etienne has shown

503
00:16:12,176 --> 00:16:14,006
you how to load and prepare your

504
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:16,566
depth data, it's my pleasure to

505
00:16:16,566 --> 00:16:18,106
be here to show you a couple of

506
00:16:18,106 --> 00:16:20,136
ways that you can use depth now

507
00:16:20,136 --> 00:16:22,356
to achieve some new and

508
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:23,746
interesting effects on your

509
00:16:23,746 --> 00:16:24,206
images.

510
00:16:24,946 --> 00:16:26,386
So we're going to jump right in

511
00:16:26,386 --> 00:16:29,596
with a demo.

512
00:16:29,966 --> 00:16:32,846
Okay. What we're looking at here

513
00:16:32,846 --> 00:16:35,366
is -- I'm in the Photos app.

514
00:16:36,336 --> 00:16:37,666
And I'm going to enter Edit here

515
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:38,306
on this image.

516
00:16:38,596 --> 00:16:42,546
So, this effect is implemented

517
00:16:42,546 --> 00:16:43,546
here in a photo editing

518
00:16:43,546 --> 00:16:44,156
extension.

519
00:16:44,746 --> 00:16:48,986
And now that we got the rough

520
00:16:48,986 --> 00:16:51,026
parts out of the way, we're

521
00:16:51,026 --> 00:16:52,116
looking at the original image

522
00:16:52,116 --> 00:16:52,336
here.

523
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:54,206
No edits applied.

524
00:16:54,506 --> 00:16:55,456
And I'm going to go ahead and

525
00:16:55,456 --> 00:16:56,296
turn on the effect now.

526
00:16:57,696 --> 00:16:58,476
What you see is that I've

527
00:16:58,476 --> 00:17:00,056
applied a de-saturating effect

528
00:16:58,476 --> 00:17:00,056
applied a de-saturating effect

529
00:17:00,276 --> 00:17:01,706
to the image, but only to the

530
00:17:01,706 --> 00:17:02,536
back ground region.

531
00:17:03,596 --> 00:17:05,195
And I can pick a different

532
00:17:05,435 --> 00:17:07,406
background effect to apply.

533
00:17:07,406 --> 00:17:08,516
In this case I've picked just a

534
00:17:08,516 --> 00:17:09,445
flat white image.

535
00:17:10,256 --> 00:17:13,376
And maybe I'm not terribly

536
00:17:13,376 --> 00:17:14,516
satisfied with where that

537
00:17:14,516 --> 00:17:15,955
threshold is between background

538
00:17:15,955 --> 00:17:18,185
and foreground, so I can pick a

539
00:17:18,185 --> 00:17:19,496
new threshold by tapping.

540
00:17:20,646 --> 00:17:21,866
And this is all based on the

541
00:17:22,076 --> 00:17:22,626
depth data.

542
00:17:24,006 --> 00:17:25,586
So let me bring it back here to

543
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:25,986
the front.

544
00:17:25,986 --> 00:17:27,215
And you can clearly see there's

545
00:17:27,536 --> 00:17:29,706
a pretty sharp boundary between

546
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:31,066
what's considered background and

547
00:17:31,066 --> 00:17:31,596
foreground.

548
00:17:32,106 --> 00:17:33,386
There's actually a narrow region

549
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:34,726
in between where we're doing a

550
00:17:34,726 --> 00:17:35,906
little bit of blending between

551
00:17:35,906 --> 00:17:36,306
the two.

552
00:17:36,856 --> 00:17:38,436
And I have control over the size

553
00:17:38,436 --> 00:17:39,286
of that blend region.

554
00:17:40,346 --> 00:17:42,986
I can adjust that by pinching.

555
00:17:43,376 --> 00:17:44,556
And there you can see it looks

556
00:17:44,936 --> 00:17:46,776
like a pretty nice white fog

557
00:17:48,366 --> 00:17:48,536
effect.

558
00:17:49,186 --> 00:17:51,206
We've implemented this effect by

559
00:17:51,206 --> 00:17:53,306
making use of a blend mask.

560
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:54,736
So let me show you what our

561
00:17:54,736 --> 00:17:55,896
blend mask looks like here.

562
00:17:57,536 --> 00:17:59,096
The black regions of the blend

563
00:17:59,096 --> 00:18:00,016
mask correspond to the

564
00:17:59,096 --> 00:18:00,016
mask correspond to the

565
00:18:00,016 --> 00:18:00,846
background image.

566
00:18:01,266 --> 00:18:02,656
Solid white is foreground.

567
00:18:02,656 --> 00:18:03,946
And then everything in between

568
00:18:04,036 --> 00:18:05,146
is where we blend between the

569
00:18:05,146 --> 00:18:05,386
two.

570
00:18:06,146 --> 00:18:07,766
So, this is what that blend mask

571
00:18:07,766 --> 00:18:08,996
looks like as I pinch.

572
00:18:09,656 --> 00:18:10,876
We're adjusting the size and

573
00:18:10,876 --> 00:18:11,966
slope of that blend.

574
00:18:13,556 --> 00:18:14,506
Okay, back to the original

575
00:18:14,506 --> 00:18:14,826
image.

576
00:18:15,356 --> 00:18:16,506
As many of you know, there are

577
00:18:16,506 --> 00:18:18,266
so many built in interesting

578
00:18:18,266 --> 00:18:19,626
Core Image filters we could

579
00:18:19,626 --> 00:18:20,466
choose to apply.

580
00:18:21,036 --> 00:18:22,376
I'm going to show you a couple

581
00:18:22,376 --> 00:18:22,756
of others.

582
00:18:22,756 --> 00:18:24,596
This one is a hexagonal pixelate

583
00:18:24,596 --> 00:18:24,986
filter.

584
00:18:25,636 --> 00:18:27,796
And a motion blur.

585
00:18:29,636 --> 00:18:30,836
Let's say I'm happy with this.

586
00:18:30,836 --> 00:18:32,086
And I'll save it back to my

587
00:18:32,766 --> 00:18:33,616
photo library.

588
00:18:34,476 --> 00:18:36,226
Okay, now let's talk about how

589
00:18:36,226 --> 00:18:36,786
we did this.

590
00:18:40,806 --> 00:18:44,996
As I mentioned, we accomplished

591
00:18:44,996 --> 00:18:46,506
this effect by building a blend

592
00:18:46,506 --> 00:18:46,896
mask.

593
00:18:47,446 --> 00:18:48,396
And so I'll talk to you now

594
00:18:48,396 --> 00:18:49,376
about how we build that blend

595
00:18:49,376 --> 00:18:49,716
mask.

596
00:18:50,086 --> 00:18:51,216
The basic idea is that we're

597
00:18:51,216 --> 00:18:52,626
going to map our normalized

598
00:18:52,656 --> 00:18:55,106
disparity values into values

599
00:18:55,106 --> 00:18:57,056
between 0 and 1 for the mask.

600
00:18:58,556 --> 00:19:00,796
And so we want some high region

601
00:18:58,556 --> 00:19:00,796
And so we want some high region

602
00:19:00,796 --> 00:19:03,006
of disparity values to map to 1

603
00:19:03,106 --> 00:19:04,276
in our blend mask corresponding

604
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:04,946
to the foreground.

605
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:07,736
Some region of low disparity

606
00:19:07,736 --> 00:19:08,936
values to map to 0.

607
00:19:08,936 --> 00:19:10,736
And that will be the background

608
00:19:10,736 --> 00:19:11,106
region.

609
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:12,576
And then all disparity values in

610
00:19:12,576 --> 00:19:14,366
between will blend with the

611
00:19:14,366 --> 00:19:14,946
linear ramp.

612
00:19:16,986 --> 00:19:18,126
The first part of building this

613
00:19:18,126 --> 00:19:20,446
blend mask is to pick the

614
00:19:20,716 --> 00:19:23,056
threshold between background and

615
00:19:23,056 --> 00:19:23,526
foreground.

616
00:19:24,446 --> 00:19:25,506
So when the user taps on the

617
00:19:25,506 --> 00:19:29,196
image what we do is to sample

618
00:19:29,196 --> 00:19:30,816
the normalized disparity map at

619
00:19:30,816 --> 00:19:33,136
that same location and set that

620
00:19:33,136 --> 00:19:34,806
as our threshold between

621
00:19:35,146 --> 00:19:36,006
background and foreground.

622
00:19:36,646 --> 00:19:39,126
Now I'll show you the code for

623
00:19:39,126 --> 00:19:39,766
what that looks like.

624
00:19:41,786 --> 00:19:43,006
This is all accomplished using

625
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:44,466
built in Core Image filters.

626
00:19:44,466 --> 00:19:45,836
So the first of which I'd like

627
00:19:45,836 --> 00:19:47,496
to show you here is the CI Area

628
00:19:47,496 --> 00:19:48,796
Min Max Red filter.

629
00:19:49,926 --> 00:19:51,466
This filter, when you render it

630
00:19:51,466 --> 00:19:54,136
into a single pixel will return

631
00:19:54,136 --> 00:19:55,676
the minimum and maximum values

632
00:19:55,676 --> 00:19:57,136
of the image within the region

633
00:19:57,136 --> 00:19:58,036
that you specify.

634
00:19:58,386 --> 00:20:00,116
Here we're passing in the small

635
00:19:58,386 --> 00:20:00,116
Here we're passing in the small

636
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:01,536
rect that the user tapped on.

637
00:20:02,786 --> 00:20:04,226
The other thing to note about

638
00:20:04,226 --> 00:20:05,496
this line is that before we

639
00:20:05,496 --> 00:20:07,466
apply the effect we're clamping

640
00:20:07,466 --> 00:20:08,896
the disparity image so as to

641
00:20:08,896 --> 00:20:10,526
image that if the user taps near

642
00:20:10,526 --> 00:20:11,856
the boundary of the image we

643
00:20:11,856 --> 00:20:13,236
won't sample any clear pixels

644
00:20:13,236 --> 00:20:14,056
outside the boundary.

645
00:20:15,866 --> 00:20:18,046
On this line we're simply

646
00:20:18,046 --> 00:20:20,176
allocating a 4-byte buffer large

647
00:20:20,176 --> 00:20:21,426
enough to store a single pixel.

648
00:20:22,606 --> 00:20:24,086
And we render into that pixel on

649
00:20:24,086 --> 00:20:24,556
this line.

650
00:20:25,346 --> 00:20:26,846
Note that we're passing in nil

651
00:20:26,966 --> 00:20:27,876
as our color space.

652
00:20:27,876 --> 00:20:29,696
And this tells Core Image that

653
00:20:29,696 --> 00:20:31,196
we don't want it to do any color

654
00:20:31,196 --> 00:20:32,076
management for us.

655
00:20:34,256 --> 00:20:36,226
Finally we read the maximum

656
00:20:36,226 --> 00:20:37,346
disparity value out of the

657
00:20:37,346 --> 00:20:39,476
pixel's green channel and then

658
00:20:39,476 --> 00:20:41,326
remap it to the range of 0 and 1

659
00:20:41,366 --> 00:20:43,066
by dividing by 255.

660
00:20:43,716 --> 00:20:47,946
The other input the user has

661
00:20:47,946 --> 00:20:49,286
control over is the size and

662
00:20:49,286 --> 00:20:50,416
slope of the blend region.

663
00:20:50,566 --> 00:20:52,496
So as the user is pinching on

664
00:20:52,496 --> 00:20:54,596
the view, we're adjusting the

665
00:20:54,596 --> 00:20:56,066
size and slope accordingly.

666
00:20:58,306 --> 00:21:00,056
And this is the result of a

667
00:20:58,306 --> 00:21:00,056
And this is the result of a

668
00:21:00,056 --> 00:21:01,606
mapping -- sorry, this mapping

669
00:21:01,606 --> 00:21:03,756
is the result of applying a CI

670
00:21:03,756 --> 00:21:04,866
Color Matrix filter.

671
00:21:05,236 --> 00:21:06,236
So I'll show you in a second.

672
00:21:06,776 --> 00:21:08,676
But then we also apply a CI

673
00:21:08,676 --> 00:21:10,456
Color Clamp to ensure that the

674
00:21:10,456 --> 00:21:11,926
values remain within the region

675
00:21:12,026 --> 00:21:13,866
of 0 to 1, the range of 0 to 1.

676
00:21:15,126 --> 00:21:15,956
So here's the code.

677
00:21:16,446 --> 00:21:17,966
First we apply our CR Color

678
00:21:17,966 --> 00:21:19,026
Matrix filter.

679
00:21:19,706 --> 00:21:22,236
Its inputs are essentially the

680
00:21:22,706 --> 00:21:24,496
slope and the bias that were

681
00:21:24,496 --> 00:21:26,016
selected by the user by tapping

682
00:21:26,016 --> 00:21:26,486
and pinching.

683
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:29,346
And then on a single line we

684
00:21:29,346 --> 00:21:31,386
apply the CI Color Clamp filter.

685
00:21:32,816 --> 00:21:36,116
Now that we've build the blend

686
00:21:36,116 --> 00:21:37,136
mask, the rest is

687
00:21:37,136 --> 00:21:37,766
straightforward.

688
00:21:37,856 --> 00:21:39,586
What you see on the left is the

689
00:21:39,586 --> 00:21:40,456
original image.

690
00:21:40,746 --> 00:21:42,016
And on the right you see that

691
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:43,556
image with the background effect

692
00:21:43,556 --> 00:21:43,926
applied.

693
00:21:45,836 --> 00:21:47,156
When we apply the blend mask to

694
00:21:47,156 --> 00:21:49,216
the original image, the

695
00:21:49,216 --> 00:21:50,596
background region disappears.

696
00:21:50,716 --> 00:21:51,956
And when we blend that together

697
00:21:52,606 --> 00:21:53,866
with the background image, we

698
00:21:53,866 --> 00:21:54,676
get our final effect.

699
00:21:55,666 --> 00:21:58,226
One more slide of code.

700
00:21:59,396 --> 00:22:00,356
Here's where we apply our

701
00:21:59,396 --> 00:22:00,356
Here's where we apply our

702
00:22:00,356 --> 00:22:01,146
background filter.

703
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:03,676
This could be any filter you

704
00:22:03,676 --> 00:22:04,156
choose.

705
00:22:04,436 --> 00:22:05,636
There are many built into Core

706
00:22:05,636 --> 00:22:05,956
Image.

707
00:22:05,956 --> 00:22:06,756
You could write your own.

708
00:22:08,326 --> 00:22:09,886
And then we apply the CI Blend

709
00:22:09,886 --> 00:22:12,426
With Mask filter, passing in

710
00:22:12,516 --> 00:22:14,326
both the background image and

711
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:17,296
the mask.

712
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:19,076
And that's it.

713
00:22:19,316 --> 00:22:20,406
That's how we accomplish this

714
00:22:20,406 --> 00:22:24,096
effect using a suite of built in

715
00:22:24,096 --> 00:22:25,026
Core Image filters.

716
00:22:25,586 --> 00:22:27,846
And next I'd like to jump in and

717
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:28,956
show you another demo.

718
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:33,206
For this one -- the previous one

719
00:22:33,696 --> 00:22:36,266
we used disparity -- depth data

720
00:22:36,576 --> 00:22:37,966
indirectly, right?

721
00:22:38,156 --> 00:22:40,086
We used it to build a blend

722
00:22:40,086 --> 00:22:40,546
mask.

723
00:22:41,326 --> 00:22:42,316
For this one we're going to use

724
00:22:42,316 --> 00:22:44,736
disparity a little bit in more

725
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:45,706
of a direct fashion.

726
00:22:46,306 --> 00:22:50,226
And I'm going to pull up this

727
00:22:50,226 --> 00:22:51,566
other editing extension here to

728
00:22:51,566 --> 00:22:52,036
show it to you.

729
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:53,846
Okay. Here we are in photos

730
00:22:53,846 --> 00:22:54,116
again.

731
00:22:55,086 --> 00:22:56,886
Let's pick this next extension.

732
00:22:58,216 --> 00:22:58,966
There we go.

733
00:22:59,946 --> 00:23:00,666
Original image.

734
00:22:59,946 --> 00:23:00,666
Original image.

735
00:23:00,916 --> 00:23:02,176
No edits applied just yet.

736
00:23:02,176 --> 00:23:04,386
I have a slider at the bottom,

737
00:23:04,386 --> 00:23:04,646
though.

738
00:23:04,886 --> 00:23:06,726
And I'll start to move that now.

739
00:23:06,726 --> 00:23:09,706
And you can see that the

740
00:23:09,706 --> 00:23:11,676
background fades to black,

741
00:23:11,926 --> 00:23:13,226
leaving us just this prominent

742
00:23:13,226 --> 00:23:13,956
foreground figure.

743
00:23:14,526 --> 00:23:15,446
That's a really nice effect,

744
00:23:17,056 --> 00:23:17,566
wouldn't you say?

745
00:23:18,466 --> 00:23:20,766
Let's save that back to the

746
00:23:21,026 --> 00:23:22,496
library and show you how this

747
00:23:22,496 --> 00:23:22,916
one's done.

748
00:23:23,596 --> 00:23:24,376
What we're doing is we're

749
00:23:24,376 --> 00:23:25,686
mapping our normalized disparity

750
00:23:25,686 --> 00:23:28,086
values into a scale value, which

751
00:23:28,086 --> 00:23:29,406
we then apply directly to our

752
00:23:29,406 --> 00:23:29,916
pixels.

753
00:23:31,216 --> 00:23:33,286
And for this particular effect

754
00:23:33,726 --> 00:23:36,066
we're mapping our disparity

755
00:23:36,066 --> 00:23:37,736
values through an exponential

756
00:23:37,736 --> 00:23:39,426
function, which when we start

757
00:23:39,426 --> 00:23:41,656
off, we raise our normalized

758
00:23:41,656 --> 00:23:44,136
disparity values to the power of

759
00:23:44,136 --> 00:23:44,656
0.

760
00:23:44,806 --> 00:23:47,186
And that maps all of our scale

761
00:23:47,186 --> 00:23:49,556
factors into one, producing no

762
00:23:49,556 --> 00:23:50,636
effect on the output image.

763
00:23:51,186 --> 00:23:53,606
When we raise the power to 1 as

764
00:23:53,606 --> 00:23:55,356
we move the slider over, this is

765
00:23:55,356 --> 00:23:57,956
effectively the same thing as

766
00:23:58,426 --> 00:24:00,926
scaling our pixel intensities by

767
00:23:58,426 --> 00:24:00,926
scaling our pixel intensities by

768
00:24:01,166 --> 00:24:03,686
the inverse of the depth.

769
00:24:03,686 --> 00:24:04,746
Because we're scaling by

770
00:24:04,966 --> 00:24:05,926
disparity directly.

771
00:24:06,846 --> 00:24:08,866
The effect becomes more

772
00:24:08,866 --> 00:24:10,106
interesting as we start to raise

773
00:24:10,106 --> 00:24:11,476
it to higher and higher powers.

774
00:24:12,146 --> 00:24:14,236
As you can see, the shape of the

775
00:24:14,236 --> 00:24:15,476
curve becomes such that there's

776
00:24:15,476 --> 00:24:16,746
a sharper distinction between

777
00:24:16,746 --> 00:24:18,786
background and foreground with

778
00:24:18,786 --> 00:24:19,836
the background quickly going to

779
00:24:19,836 --> 00:24:20,156
black.

780
00:24:20,596 --> 00:24:24,566
So I'm going to show you the

781
00:24:24,566 --> 00:24:25,886
code for this effect in just one

782
00:24:25,886 --> 00:24:26,236
slide.

783
00:24:26,386 --> 00:24:28,506
We've implemented this effect as

784
00:24:28,506 --> 00:24:29,936
a custom CI Color Kernel.

785
00:24:29,996 --> 00:24:31,076
And there are a couple of

786
00:24:31,076 --> 00:24:32,826
notable advantages to using a

787
00:24:32,826 --> 00:24:33,916
customer CI Color Kernel.

788
00:24:34,446 --> 00:24:35,976
One of which is performance.

789
00:24:35,976 --> 00:24:37,446
If you are able to express your

790
00:24:37,446 --> 00:24:39,076
effect in terms of a custom CI

791
00:24:39,076 --> 00:24:40,766
Color Kernel, Core Image is able

792
00:24:40,766 --> 00:24:42,196
to optimize that by

793
00:24:42,196 --> 00:24:43,726
concatenating your kernel into

794
00:24:43,726 --> 00:24:46,086
its render graph, thereby

795
00:24:46,346 --> 00:24:49,596
skipping any potentially costly

796
00:24:49,596 --> 00:24:50,916
intermediate images along the

797
00:24:50,916 --> 00:24:51,116
way.

798
00:24:51,976 --> 00:24:54,406
The other nice thing about this

799
00:24:54,406 --> 00:24:56,376
is that Core Image allows us to

800
00:24:56,376 --> 00:24:59,486
pass in multiple input images.

801
00:24:59,486 --> 00:25:00,136
And Core Image will

802
00:24:59,486 --> 00:25:00,136
And Core Image will

803
00:25:00,136 --> 00:25:01,626
automatically sample those for

804
00:25:01,626 --> 00:25:03,006
us and passing in those sample

805
00:25:03,006 --> 00:25:04,456
values to us as parameters to

806
00:25:04,456 --> 00:25:05,786
our kernel function, which you

807
00:25:05,786 --> 00:25:06,346
see here.

808
00:25:06,766 --> 00:25:08,606
The first parameter is a sample

809
00:25:08,606 --> 00:25:09,676
from the original image.

810
00:25:09,926 --> 00:25:11,126
The second is a sample from the

811
00:25:11,126 --> 00:25:12,236
normalized disparity map.

812
00:25:12,476 --> 00:25:14,096
And then third is the power

813
00:25:14,096 --> 00:25:15,296
selected by the user moving the

814
00:25:15,296 --> 00:25:15,706
slider.

815
00:25:17,356 --> 00:25:18,306
The first thing we do with a

816
00:25:18,306 --> 00:25:19,946
normalized disparity is to raise

817
00:25:19,946 --> 00:25:21,266
it to a power, as I mentioned.

818
00:25:22,056 --> 00:25:23,366
That gives us our scale factor.

819
00:25:24,556 --> 00:25:25,706
Then we take our scale factor

820
00:25:25,706 --> 00:25:27,446
and apply it to the intensity of

821
00:25:27,446 --> 00:25:28,926
the pixel while preserving the

822
00:25:28,926 --> 00:25:29,946
original alpha value.

823
00:25:32,096 --> 00:25:33,616
This last line is a line of

824
00:25:33,616 --> 00:25:36,156
Swift code illustrating how we

825
00:25:36,156 --> 00:25:37,706
can apply our custom kernel to

826
00:25:37,706 --> 00:25:39,106
our original image once it's

827
00:25:39,106 --> 00:25:40,386
been constructed from the source

828
00:25:40,386 --> 00:25:41,096
code you see above.

829
00:25:41,496 --> 00:25:43,576
We pass in our image extent as

830
00:25:43,576 --> 00:25:45,266
well as a list of arguments.

831
00:25:45,356 --> 00:25:46,986
Here these are the original

832
00:25:46,986 --> 00:25:48,416
image, the normalized disparity

833
00:25:48,416 --> 00:25:49,976
map, and the power selected by

834
00:25:49,976 --> 00:25:50,466
the user.

835
00:25:50,566 --> 00:25:52,046
Note that these arguments

836
00:25:52,046 --> 00:25:53,576
correspond one to one with the

837
00:25:53,576 --> 00:25:55,266
parameters defined in our kernel

838
00:25:55,266 --> 00:25:55,706
signature.

839
00:25:57,666 --> 00:25:58,886
Okay. So that's it.

840
00:25:58,886 --> 00:26:00,016
I've just shown you how to use a

841
00:25:58,886 --> 00:26:00,016
I've just shown you how to use a

842
00:26:00,016 --> 00:26:02,006
custom CI Color Kernel to

843
00:26:02,006 --> 00:26:03,466
produce this really nice

844
00:26:03,546 --> 00:26:04,826
darkening background effect.

845
00:26:05,476 --> 00:26:06,666
And hopefully it gives you some

846
00:26:06,666 --> 00:26:08,076
ideas of other things you can do

847
00:26:08,076 --> 00:26:09,766
with custom CI Color Kernels

848
00:26:09,766 --> 00:26:10,916
combined with depth to produce

849
00:26:10,916 --> 00:26:11,686
some nice effects.

850
00:26:11,686 --> 00:26:13,036
So now I'm going to invite my

851
00:26:13,036 --> 00:26:15,256
colleague Alex up onto the stage

852
00:26:15,256 --> 00:26:16,786
to show you something brand new

853
00:26:16,786 --> 00:26:17,576
in Core Image.

&gt;&gt; Thank you, Stephen.

857
00:26:26,336 --> 00:26:27,076
Good morning everyone.

858
00:26:27,876 --> 00:26:29,146
May name is Alexandre Naaman.

859
00:26:29,146 --> 00:26:30,906
And today I'm really excited to

860
00:26:30,906 --> 00:26:31,126
be here.

861
00:26:31,126 --> 00:26:31,866
And today I'm going to talk to

862
00:26:31,866 --> 00:26:32,886
you about a new Core Image

863
00:26:32,886 --> 00:26:33,456
filter we have.

864
00:26:34,266 --> 00:26:37,526
So as you know, in iOS 10 using

865
00:26:37,526 --> 00:26:38,556
the iPhone 7+.

866
00:26:39,106 --> 00:26:41,126
You could capture images using

867
00:26:41,126 --> 00:26:43,316
with depth capabilities using

868
00:26:43,316 --> 00:26:44,866
the camera app and the portrait

869
00:26:44,866 --> 00:26:45,056
mode.

870
00:26:46,536 --> 00:26:49,616
Now, with iOS 11, and Mac OS

871
00:26:49,616 --> 00:26:51,676
High Sierra, we're enhancing

872
00:26:51,676 --> 00:26:53,796
those capabilities by allowing

873
00:26:53,796 --> 00:26:54,996
you to use those exact same

874
00:26:54,996 --> 00:26:56,856
algorithms via a new Core Image

875
00:26:56,856 --> 00:26:58,406
filter called the CI Depth Blur

876
00:26:58,406 --> 00:26:58,726
Effect.

877
00:26:59,806 --> 00:27:02,256
So, now let's try and switch

878
00:26:59,806 --> 00:27:02,256
So, now let's try and switch

879
00:27:02,256 --> 00:27:04,176
over to a demo and see how that

880
00:27:04,176 --> 00:27:04,936
works in real life.

881
00:27:07,576 --> 00:27:09,976
Yay! All right.

882
00:27:09,976 --> 00:27:10,856
So here we have an asset, a

883
00:27:10,856 --> 00:27:12,046
photo that was taken with depth.

884
00:27:12,046 --> 00:27:13,616
And we're just viewing the image

885
00:27:13,926 --> 00:27:14,836
without having applied any

886
00:27:14,836 --> 00:27:16,566
filters to it.

887
00:27:18,416 --> 00:27:20,536
If I tap on this once, we can

888
00:27:20,536 --> 00:27:22,196
see what the disparity data

889
00:27:22,196 --> 00:27:22,656
looks like.

890
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:24,676
I'm going to tap on it once more

891
00:27:24,676 --> 00:27:25,456
and we'll back to the main

892
00:27:25,456 --> 00:27:25,846
image.

893
00:27:25,846 --> 00:27:27,606
And if I tap once more, we're

894
00:27:28,046 --> 00:27:28,976
going to see what happens when

895
00:27:28,976 --> 00:27:30,366
we use those two images together

896
00:27:30,706 --> 00:27:32,166
along with the new CI Depth Blur

897
00:27:32,166 --> 00:27:33,746
Effect filter to create a new

898
00:27:33,866 --> 00:27:34,496
rendered result.

899
00:27:34,926 --> 00:27:35,846
We should see the background get

900
00:27:35,846 --> 00:27:36,146
blurry.

901
00:27:36,926 --> 00:27:41,476
Yay. So now, in addition to just

902
00:27:41,476 --> 00:27:44,156
applying the filter as is, there

903
00:27:44,156 --> 00:27:45,906
are many tunable parameters that

904
00:27:45,906 --> 00:27:46,376
we can set.

905
00:27:46,376 --> 00:27:48,076
And inside of this application

906
00:27:48,586 --> 00:27:49,846
I've set things up such that it

907
00:27:49,906 --> 00:27:51,316
will respond to a few gestures.

908
00:27:51,546 --> 00:27:53,646
So, if I now, for example,

909
00:27:53,646 --> 00:27:56,016
pinch, we can dynamically change

910
00:27:56,016 --> 00:27:58,056
the aperture and get a new

911
00:27:58,056 --> 00:27:58,816
simulated look.

912
00:27:58,816 --> 00:28:00,506
And so we can simulate any lens

913
00:27:58,816 --> 00:28:00,506
And so we can simulate any lens

914
00:28:00,976 --> 00:28:02,396
opening that we would like quite

915
00:28:02,396 --> 00:28:02,806
simply.

916
00:28:05,796 --> 00:28:06,906
Another gesture I've set up in

917
00:28:06,906 --> 00:28:08,466
this application is such that

918
00:28:08,796 --> 00:28:10,156
when we tap at a different

919
00:28:10,156 --> 00:28:11,256
location it's going to change

920
00:28:11,256 --> 00:28:12,296
the focus rectangle.

921
00:28:12,586 --> 00:28:14,376
And so we can see right now the

922
00:28:14,376 --> 00:28:15,766
aperture is quite wide open.

923
00:28:16,136 --> 00:28:17,746
And only the lady in the front

924
00:28:17,746 --> 00:28:18,306
is in focus.

925
00:28:18,306 --> 00:28:19,626
But if I tap on the lady on the

926
00:28:19,626 --> 00:28:20,886
left, all of a sudden now she's

927
00:28:20,886 --> 00:28:21,426
in focus.

928
00:28:21,426 --> 00:28:22,756
The background is a little less

929
00:28:22,756 --> 00:28:23,176
blurry.

930
00:28:23,626 --> 00:28:24,496
And the gentleman on the right

931
00:28:24,496 --> 00:28:25,996
is still a little blurry.

932
00:28:25,996 --> 00:28:27,336
And I can tap on him now and

933
00:28:27,336 --> 00:28:28,336
change the focus rect once

934
00:28:28,336 --> 00:28:28,676
again.

935
00:28:29,366 --> 00:28:32,686
And now they're all three in

936
00:28:32,686 --> 00:28:33,716
focus and the background still

937
00:28:33,716 --> 00:28:34,246
remains blurry.

938
00:28:35,866 --> 00:28:37,056
Now that we're done with our

939
00:28:37,056 --> 00:28:38,656
demo, let's go and look at how

940
00:28:38,656 --> 00:28:38,976
this happens --

942

943
00:28:50,696 --> 00:28:52,996
Okay. So as I was mentioning, at

944
00:28:52,996 --> 00:28:54,476
its base the CI Depth Blur

945
00:28:54,476 --> 00:28:55,706
Effect really just has two

946
00:28:55,706 --> 00:28:57,586
inputs: the input image and the

947
00:28:57,586 --> 00:28:58,796
input disparity image.

948
00:28:59,106 --> 00:29:00,376
And with those two, Core Image

949
00:28:59,106 --> 00:29:00,376
And with those two, Core Image

950
00:29:00,376 --> 00:29:01,296

many parameters that you can

956
00:29:14,096 --> 00:29:15,086
set, as I was mentioning

957
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:15,476
earlier.

958
00:29:16,066 --> 00:29:17,156
We already know that you can set

959
00:29:17,156 --> 00:29:18,056
the input image and the input

960
00:29:18,056 --> 00:29:18,916
disparity image.

961
00:29:19,266 --> 00:29:19,976
And in the case of the

962
00:29:19,976 --> 00:29:21,056
application that we were looking

963
00:29:21,056 --> 00:29:23,846
at earlier, when we were

964
00:29:23,846 --> 00:29:25,856
tapping, we were setting the

965
00:29:25,856 --> 00:29:26,856
input focus rect.

966
00:29:28,236 --> 00:29:31,536
And then as we were pinching, we

967
00:29:31,536 --> 00:29:32,466
were setting the aperture.

968
00:29:33,456 --> 00:29:35,076
So now that we have an idea of

969
00:29:35,076 --> 00:29:35,906
how we want to do this from a

970
00:29:35,906 --> 00:29:37,366
conceptual standpoint, let's

971
00:29:37,366 --> 00:29:38,896
take a look at how this will be

972
00:29:38,896 --> 00:29:39,946
done in terms of code.

973
00:29:41,356 --> 00:29:44,176
And this is effectively my only

974
00:29:44,176 --> 00:29:45,256
slide that has any code on it,

975
00:29:45,256 --> 00:29:46,286
so you can see how simple it is

976
00:29:46,286 --> 00:29:46,676
to use.

977
00:29:47,586 --> 00:29:49,766
As we saw earlier, you can load

978
00:29:49,766 --> 00:29:51,706
a CI Image via URL, quite

979
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:51,966
simply.

980
00:29:51,966 --> 00:29:53,106
This gives us the main image.

981
00:29:53,106 --> 00:29:54,466
And then in order to get the

982
00:29:54,466 --> 00:29:56,036
disparity image, all you need to

983
00:29:56,036 --> 00:29:58,386
do is use that same URL and ask

984
00:29:58,966 --> 00:30:01,986
for the auxiliary disparity

985
00:29:58,966 --> 00:30:01,986
for the auxiliary disparity

986
00:30:01,986 --> 00:30:03,156
information via the Options

987
00:30:03,156 --> 00:30:04,796
dictionary as Etienne mentioned.

988
00:30:06,276 --> 00:30:08,926
Once we have our two images, we

989
00:30:08,926 --> 00:30:10,446
can create a filter.

990
00:30:10,886 --> 00:30:13,336
And we do that by name, CI Depth

991
00:30:13,336 --> 00:30:13,766
Blur Effect.

992
00:30:13,766 --> 00:30:14,796
And then we specify our two

993
00:30:14,796 --> 00:30:15,206
images.

994
00:30:15,646 --> 00:30:18,726
Once that's done, we can then

995
00:30:18,726 --> 00:30:21,286
ask for the output image via

996
00:30:21,286 --> 00:30:21,876
.outputImage.

997
00:30:21,876 --> 00:30:23,656
And we have a new CI Image that

998
00:30:23,656 --> 00:30:24,996
we can then render in any number

999
00:30:24,996 --> 00:30:25,406
of ways.

1000
00:30:26,026 --> 00:30:27,246
And it's important to remember

1001
00:30:27,246 --> 00:30:29,046
that a CI Image is really just a

1002
00:30:29,046 --> 00:30:30,016
recipe for how to render.

1003
00:30:30,016 --> 00:30:31,006
So this is actually a quite

1004
00:30:31,006 --> 00:30:31,776
lightweight object.

1005
00:30:34,366 --> 00:30:35,556
In the case of the application

1006
00:30:35,556 --> 00:30:36,606
that we were looking at earlier,

1007
00:30:37,476 --> 00:30:38,656
all we had to do in order to

1008
00:30:38,656 --> 00:30:40,016
render a new effect with a new

1009
00:30:40,016 --> 00:30:42,076
look was to change two values.

1010
00:30:42,246 --> 00:30:43,886
So in this case, we changed the

1011
00:30:43,886 --> 00:30:44,626
input aperture.

1012
00:30:44,626 --> 00:30:45,876
And we do that by calling filter

1013
00:30:45,876 --> 00:30:48,966
setValue forKey and specifying a

1014
00:30:48,966 --> 00:30:51,206
float value between 1 and 22 to

1015
00:30:51,206 --> 00:30:52,446
create a new simulated aperture.

1016
00:30:53,376 --> 00:30:55,356
And we specified a new rectangle

1017
00:30:55,556 --> 00:30:56,826
where we wanted to focus on via

1018
00:30:57,116 --> 00:30:58,906
the input focus rec key, which

1019
00:30:58,906 --> 00:31:00,826
corresponds to a lower left

1020
00:30:58,906 --> 00:31:00,826
corresponds to a lower left

1021
00:31:01,256 --> 00:31:03,906
based rectangle in normalized

1022
00:31:03,906 --> 00:31:04,436
coordinates.

1023
00:31:06,216 --> 00:31:07,316
Once those two things are done,

1024
00:31:07,436 --> 00:31:08,846
we can ask that filter for a new

1025
00:31:08,846 --> 00:31:12,826
output image and then render as

1026
00:31:12,826 --> 00:31:13,456
we wish.

1027
00:31:14,976 --> 00:31:17,066
Now as I was mentioning, Core

1028
00:31:17,066 --> 00:31:18,286
Image does a lot of things for

1029
00:31:18,286 --> 00:31:20,096
you automatically by examining

1030
00:31:20,096 --> 00:31:21,086
the metadata.

1031
00:31:21,516 --> 00:31:22,506
There are, however, a few things

1032
00:31:22,506 --> 00:31:25,006
you can do in order to further

1033
00:31:25,006 --> 00:31:26,996
enhance the render that we don't

1034
00:31:26,996 --> 00:31:28,026
do for you automatically.

1035
00:31:28,906 --> 00:31:31,286
And those relate to finding

1036
00:31:31,286 --> 00:31:32,146
facial landmarks.

1037
00:31:33,236 --> 00:31:35,286
And you can use the new vision

1038
00:31:35,286 --> 00:31:37,046
framework that we have in order

1039
00:31:37,046 --> 00:31:37,526
to do this.

1040
00:31:37,796 --> 00:31:39,226
So, via the vision framework you

1041
00:31:39,226 --> 00:31:41,286
can get the left eye positions,

1042
00:31:41,526 --> 00:31:43,846
right eye positions, nose

1043
00:31:43,846 --> 00:31:45,646
positions and chin positions.

1044
00:31:45,786 --> 00:31:48,526
And you can specify up to four

1045
00:31:48,526 --> 00:31:50,696
faces to be used inside of the

1046
00:31:50,696 --> 00:31:51,826
CI Depth Blur Effect.

1047
00:31:52,726 --> 00:31:53,806
In the case of this image,

1048
00:31:54,086 --> 00:31:55,306
because there are three faces,

1049
00:31:55,776 --> 00:31:57,806
we would actually specify six

1050
00:31:58,046 --> 00:32:00,456
floating point values into a CI

1051
00:31:58,046 --> 00:32:00,456
floating point values into a CI

1052
00:32:00,456 --> 00:32:02,166
vector and set that for each

1053
00:32:02,166 --> 00:32:03,206
landmark that we found.

1054
00:32:04,396 --> 00:32:05,836
And there are [inaudible], so it

1055
00:32:05,836 --> 00:32:09,106
would be xy, xy, xy.

1056
00:32:12,216 --> 00:32:13,436
The next thing I'd like to talk

1057
00:32:13,436 --> 00:32:14,536
to you a little bit about is

1058
00:32:14,626 --> 00:32:17,646
dealing with rendering outputs

1059
00:32:17,646 --> 00:32:20,576
of different sizes.

1060
00:32:21,766 --> 00:32:23,606
Although the inputs are quite

1061
00:32:23,606 --> 00:32:25,576
large, 12 megapixels, chances

1062
00:32:25,576 --> 00:32:26,876
are you won't often be rendering

1063
00:32:26,876 --> 00:32:27,656
the entire image.

1064
00:32:27,926 --> 00:32:29,106
And you may want to down sample

1065
00:32:29,106 --> 00:32:29,546
the output.

1066
00:32:30,546 --> 00:32:32,266
Your initial reflex may be to

1067
00:32:32,266 --> 00:32:34,306
just down sample it, the result

1068
00:32:34,306 --> 00:32:35,716
of the CI Depth Blur Effect.

1069
00:32:35,716 --> 00:32:37,186
But that's actually not very

1070
00:32:37,186 --> 00:32:38,386
efficient because the CI Depth

1071
00:32:38,386 --> 00:32:39,396
Blur Effect is actually quite

1072
00:32:39,396 --> 00:32:40,466
computationally expensive.

1073
00:32:40,466 --> 00:32:43,356
It makes more sense to, instead,

1074
00:32:43,356 --> 00:32:44,646
down sample the input.

1075
00:32:44,866 --> 00:32:47,736
And if you do this, we can then

1076
00:32:48,106 --> 00:32:49,186
take advantage of the fact that

1077
00:32:49,186 --> 00:32:50,986
the input image is smaller and

1078
00:32:50,986 --> 00:32:52,126
perform some optimizations.

1079
00:32:53,406 --> 00:32:54,346
In order to do this, however,

1080
00:32:54,346 --> 00:32:55,416
you do have to set one more

1081
00:32:55,416 --> 00:32:56,806
parameter, which is called the

1082
00:32:56,806 --> 00:32:57,876
Input Scale Factor.

1083
00:32:58,756 --> 00:33:00,406
So in this case if we wanted to

1084
00:32:58,756 --> 00:33:00,406
So in this case if we wanted to

1085
00:33:00,406 --> 00:33:02,066
down sample the image by 2, we

1086
00:33:02,066 --> 00:33:03,366
would set the input scale factor

1087
00:33:03,366 --> 00:33:04,166
to 0.5.

1088
00:33:04,526 --> 00:33:06,306
And doing so ensures that we

1089
00:33:06,686 --> 00:33:07,816
sample appropriately from the

1090
00:33:07,816 --> 00:33:09,136
image and also take into account

1091
00:33:09,136 --> 00:33:10,886
other effects such as the noise

1092
00:33:10,886 --> 00:33:11,296
in the image.

1093
00:33:13,846 --> 00:33:16,116
There are a few additional

1094
00:33:16,116 --> 00:33:17,286
things that I'd like to mention

1095
00:33:17,776 --> 00:33:19,136
about using the CI Depth Blue

1096
00:33:19,136 --> 00:33:20,036
Effect which are important to

1097
00:33:20,036 --> 00:33:20,576
keep in mind.

1098
00:33:21,496 --> 00:33:23,756
The first and foremost is that

1099
00:33:23,756 --> 00:33:25,526
when you create your CI context

1100
00:33:26,306 --> 00:33:27,356
where you'll be using these

1101
00:33:27,356 --> 00:33:28,786
filters, you're going to want to

1102
00:33:28,786 --> 00:33:30,086
make sure that you're using half

1103
00:33:30,086 --> 00:33:31,016
float intermediates.

1104
00:33:31,326 --> 00:33:32,256
And you can do this by

1105
00:33:32,256 --> 00:33:34,006
specifying the kCI Context

1106
00:33:34,006 --> 00:33:36,926
Working Format to be RWAH.

1107
00:33:38,286 --> 00:33:39,756
On MacOS this is the default.

1108
00:33:39,756 --> 00:33:41,736
But on iOS, by default we use

1109
00:33:41,736 --> 00:33:42,096
8-bit.

1110
00:33:42,096 --> 00:33:43,596
And if you don't, you will see

1111
00:33:43,596 --> 00:33:45,206
that the data will be clipped

1112
00:33:45,206 --> 00:33:47,166
because disparity data comes in

1113
00:33:47,166 --> 00:33:47,936
extended range.

1114
00:33:48,326 --> 00:33:49,776
And without specifying this, it

1115
00:33:49,776 --> 00:33:50,786
will get clipped and the result

1116
00:33:50,786 --> 00:33:51,626
won't look very good.

1117
00:33:51,626 --> 00:33:52,646
So it's really important to

1118
00:33:52,646 --> 00:33:53,766
remember to keep doing this when

1119
00:33:53,766 --> 00:33:54,756
you use this filter.

1120
00:33:57,466 --> 00:33:59,956
Also as I mentioned earlier, the

1121
00:34:00,186 --> 00:34:02,506
CI Depth Blur Effect will

1122
00:34:02,506 --> 00:34:03,946
automatically set many

1123
00:34:03,946 --> 00:34:05,546
properties for you on the

1124
00:34:05,546 --> 00:34:05,926
filter.

1125
00:34:05,926 --> 00:34:07,986
In order to do so, it will

1126
00:34:07,986 --> 00:34:09,186
examine the metadata from the

1127
00:34:09,186 --> 00:34:13,406
main image as well the data that

1128
00:34:13,406 --> 00:34:16,315
exists inside of the auxiliary

1129
00:34:16,315 --> 00:34:16,576
image.

1130
00:34:16,735 --> 00:34:18,156
And so it's important to try to

1131
00:34:18,476 --> 00:34:19,565
preserve that throughout your

1132
00:34:19,565 --> 00:34:20,085
pipeline.

1133
00:34:20,446 --> 00:34:22,216
Core Image will do its best in

1134
00:34:22,216 --> 00:34:23,056
order to ensure that this

1135
00:34:23,056 --> 00:34:23,485
happens.

1136
00:34:23,846 --> 00:34:24,626
But it's something you're going

1137
00:34:24,626 --> 00:34:25,456
to want to keep in mind as

1138
00:34:25,456 --> 00:34:26,275
you're using this filter.

1139
00:34:26,326 --> 00:34:27,636
And Etienne's going to talk to

1140
00:34:27,636 --> 00:34:28,656
you a little bit later about how

1141
00:34:28,656 --> 00:34:29,966
to ensure that you do this when

1142
00:34:29,966 --> 00:34:30,795
you save images.

1143
00:34:31,525 --> 00:34:31,746
All right.

1144
00:34:33,335 --> 00:34:36,306
Well, the last thing I'd like to

1145
00:34:36,306 --> 00:34:37,896
talk to you about today has to

1146
00:34:37,896 --> 00:34:40,576
do with some internals of the CI

1147
00:34:40,576 --> 00:34:41,266
Depth Blur Effect.

1148
00:34:42,456 --> 00:34:43,596
It's been mentioned many times

1149
00:34:43,596 --> 00:34:46,286
so far already today, the main

1150
00:34:46,286 --> 00:34:47,426
image and the disparity image

1151
00:34:47,426 --> 00:34:49,235
are of very different

1152
00:34:49,235 --> 00:34:49,806
resolutions.

1153
00:34:49,806 --> 00:34:52,806
And now internally, Core Image

1154
00:34:52,806 --> 00:34:54,356
is going to up sample the

1155
00:34:54,356 --> 00:34:56,156
disparity image up to a certain

1156
00:34:56,156 --> 00:34:58,216
point in order to achieve the

1157
00:34:58,216 --> 00:34:58,906
final result.

1158
00:35:00,116 --> 00:35:02,006
And this is an area where we

1159
00:35:02,006 --> 00:35:03,036
feel like if you have additional

1160
00:35:03,036 --> 00:35:04,366
processing time you could

1161
00:35:04,366 --> 00:35:05,866
perhaps do something a little

1162
00:35:05,866 --> 00:35:06,246
different.

1163
00:35:06,826 --> 00:35:08,046
Maybe some of the methods that

1164
00:35:08,196 --> 00:35:09,366
Etienne spoke of earlier.

1165
00:35:10,936 --> 00:35:12,836
And that concludes pretty much

1166
00:35:12,836 --> 00:35:13,736
everything I wanted to tell you

1167
00:35:13,736 --> 00:35:15,106
about using the CI Depth Blur

1168
00:35:15,106 --> 00:35:15,406
Effect.

1169
00:35:15,726 --> 00:35:16,996
And I hope you all go and start

1170
00:35:16,996 --> 00:35:18,146
adding it to your apps.

1171
00:35:18,466 --> 00:35:19,546
And on that, I'm going to hand

1172
00:35:19,546 --> 00:35:20,406
it back over to Etienne.

1173
00:35:20,406 --> 00:35:21,126
Thank you very much.

&gt;&gt; Thank you, Alex.

1176
00:35:26,536 --> 00:35:27,526
All right.

1177
00:35:27,856 --> 00:35:28,976
So, so far we've seen

1178
00:35:28,976 --> 00:35:30,576
interesting cool new effects

1179
00:35:30,576 --> 00:35:32,026
that you can do using depth

1180
00:35:32,026 --> 00:35:32,166
data.

1181
00:35:32,316 --> 00:35:34,606
But the depth data was really

1182
00:35:34,606 --> 00:35:36,716
used as a mask to apply

1183
00:35:36,716 --> 00:35:38,426
different effects to different

1184
00:35:38,426 --> 00:35:39,646
part of the image.

1185
00:35:40,356 --> 00:35:42,106
And so now we want to show you

1186
00:35:42,106 --> 00:35:42,846
something different.

1187
00:35:44,366 --> 00:35:45,676
Something that actually uses

1188
00:35:45,676 --> 00:35:47,296
depth as a third dimension.

1189
00:35:48,376 --> 00:35:49,766
And this will give you a taste

1190
00:35:49,766 --> 00:35:51,006
of what kind of new creative

1191
00:35:51,006 --> 00:35:52,246
effects you could apply using

1192
00:35:52,246 --> 00:35:52,916
this data.

1193
00:35:53,956 --> 00:35:55,656
And to tell you all about it,

1194
00:35:55,656 --> 00:35:57,036
I'm going to invite Stephen back

1195
00:35:57,036 --> 00:35:57,466
on stage.

1196
00:35:57,926 --> 00:35:58,776

1198
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:04,176
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Etienne.

1199
00:36:05,196 --> 00:36:06,346
It's good to be back with you.

1200
00:36:06,346 --> 00:36:07,826
What I'm going to show you now

1201
00:36:09,426 --> 00:36:11,026
is a true 3-D effect.

1202
00:36:12,946 --> 00:36:14,276
And this particular effect that

1203
00:36:14,276 --> 00:36:15,266
we're going to show you is

1204
00:36:15,266 --> 00:36:16,116
called dolly zoom.

1205
00:36:16,406 --> 00:36:17,436
Many of you are probably already

1206
00:36:17,436 --> 00:36:18,856
familiar with what dolly zoom

1207
00:36:18,856 --> 00:36:20,076
is, especially if you've ever

1208
00:36:20,076 --> 00:36:20,956
seen a scary movie.

1209
00:36:21,536 --> 00:36:23,886
But to get everybody up to speed

1210
00:36:23,886 --> 00:36:24,766
a little bit, I'm going to show

1211
00:36:24,766 --> 00:36:26,386
you a little animation of what's

1212
00:36:26,386 --> 00:36:27,466
going on with dolly zoom.

1213
00:36:28,136 --> 00:36:29,226
So what you're looking at here

1214
00:36:30,476 --> 00:36:32,116
is a scene consisting of three

1215
00:36:32,116 --> 00:36:32,696
spheres.

1216
00:36:33,716 --> 00:36:35,446
While the camera is dollying

1217
00:36:35,606 --> 00:36:37,686
back and forth, it's also doing

1218
00:36:37,686 --> 00:36:39,596
it so in such a way that the

1219
00:36:39,596 --> 00:36:40,716
field of view is also

1220
00:36:40,976 --> 00:36:43,016
simultaneously constrained so

1221
00:36:43,016 --> 00:36:44,696
that the gray sphere in the

1222
00:36:44,696 --> 00:36:46,686
center on the focal plane

1223
00:36:47,316 --> 00:36:49,776
remains at roughly the same size

1224
00:36:49,986 --> 00:36:51,016
throughout the effect in the

1225
00:36:51,016 --> 00:36:52,626
output image, which you see on

1226
00:36:52,626 --> 00:36:52,896
the right.

1227
00:36:53,286 --> 00:36:54,286
Everything else in the scene

1228
00:36:54,286 --> 00:36:56,106
will move around due to

1229
00:36:56,106 --> 00:36:57,046
perspective effects.

1230
00:36:58,786 --> 00:36:59,706
So let's take a look.

1231
00:37:00,886 --> 00:37:02,016
Let's switch over here to the

1232
00:37:02,016 --> 00:37:02,576
device.

1233
00:37:03,556 --> 00:37:06,356
Perfect. All right.

1234
00:37:09,176 --> 00:37:10,876
Let me pull up the dolly zoom

1235
00:37:10,876 --> 00:37:11,896
editing extension.

1236
00:37:14,406 --> 00:37:15,816
And I'll draw your attention now

1237
00:37:15,816 --> 00:37:17,676
to the group of flowers in the

1238
00:37:17,676 --> 00:37:18,666
center of the image.

1239
00:37:18,766 --> 00:37:20,566
Those are on the focal plane.

1240
00:37:21,506 --> 00:37:23,686
So as I begin to move the

1241
00:37:24,416 --> 00:37:27,236
camera, there you see the dolly

1242
00:37:27,236 --> 00:37:29,296
zoom effect in its full glory.

1243
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:31,676
When I pull the camera in this

1244
00:37:31,676 --> 00:37:32,946
direction in particular you can

1245
00:37:32,946 --> 00:37:34,456
really see the true 3-D nature

1246
00:37:34,456 --> 00:37:36,306
of this effect with the

1247
00:37:36,396 --> 00:37:37,606
foreground flowers really

1248
00:37:37,936 --> 00:37:39,456
popping out and the background

1249
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:41,456
sort of fading or pulling away

1250
00:37:41,456 --> 00:37:41,996
from the camera.

1251
00:37:42,956 --> 00:37:44,156
You do also see a couple of

1252
00:37:44,156 --> 00:37:45,296
artifacts, of course.

1253
00:37:45,676 --> 00:37:47,516
One of which are the black

1254
00:37:47,516 --> 00:37:49,286
pixels that you see coming into

1255
00:37:49,286 --> 00:37:50,556
view around the background.

1256
00:37:51,316 --> 00:37:53,106
This is due to the fact that in

1257
00:37:53,106 --> 00:37:54,046
the camera's current

1258
00:37:54,116 --> 00:37:55,376
configuration, the virtual

1259
00:37:55,376 --> 00:37:57,346
camera, its field of view is

1260
00:37:57,346 --> 00:38:00,096
wider than the iPhone that

1261
00:37:57,346 --> 00:38:00,096
wider than the iPhone that

1262
00:38:00,096 --> 00:38:00,876
captured the image.

1263
00:38:01,926 --> 00:38:03,996
And so the virtual camera sees

1264
00:38:03,996 --> 00:38:05,356
more of the scene than the

1265
00:38:05,506 --> 00:38:06,616
iPhone did at the time of

1266
00:38:06,616 --> 00:38:07,116
capture.

1267
00:38:07,656 --> 00:38:08,866
So we're just filling those

1268
00:38:08,866 --> 00:38:09,866
pixels in with black.

1269
00:38:10,886 --> 00:38:12,936
Similarly, the stretching you

1270
00:38:12,936 --> 00:38:14,286
see in between the foreground

1271
00:38:14,286 --> 00:38:15,796
flowers and the green leaves

1272
00:38:15,796 --> 00:38:17,046
behind them is due to the fact

1273
00:38:17,046 --> 00:38:18,216
that this camera, the virtual

1274
00:38:18,216 --> 00:38:19,146
camera, has exposed some

1275
00:38:19,146 --> 00:38:20,416
portions of the scene that

1276
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:22,376
weren't visible to the iPhone at

1277
00:38:22,526 --> 00:38:24,406
the time of capture.

1278
00:38:24,406 --> 00:38:26,256
One strategy you might take to

1279
00:38:26,256 --> 00:38:27,926
work around some of these issues

1280
00:38:28,676 --> 00:38:30,576
is to set a new focal plane.

1281
00:38:31,256 --> 00:38:33,376
So, now I've tapped on the

1282
00:38:33,376 --> 00:38:35,016
yellow flower in the foreground,

1283
00:38:35,016 --> 00:38:35,986
which is in the bottom right

1284
00:38:35,986 --> 00:38:38,086
corner of the image to set that

1285
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:39,356
as the focal plane.

1286
00:38:39,846 --> 00:38:41,266
And as I move the camera now in

1287
00:38:41,266 --> 00:38:42,636
this direction you can see that

1288
00:38:43,176 --> 00:38:44,806
none of the black pixels are

1289
00:38:44,806 --> 00:38:45,546
coming into view.

1290
00:38:45,876 --> 00:38:47,486
Of course if I move the camera

1291
00:38:47,486 --> 00:38:49,406
again in this direction, they

1292
00:38:49,406 --> 00:38:50,076
show up again.

1293
00:38:50,586 --> 00:38:51,946
And really, that 3-D effect is

1294
00:38:51,946 --> 00:38:54,646
quite strong here.

1295
00:38:55,266 --> 00:38:57,426
Correspondingly, I can tap on a

1296
00:38:57,426 --> 00:38:58,496
background region of the image,

1297
00:38:58,496 --> 00:39:00,026
such as the trees you see in the

1298
00:38:58,496 --> 00:39:00,026
such as the trees you see in the

1299
00:39:00,026 --> 00:39:00,776
upper left corner.

1300
00:39:01,746 --> 00:39:03,646
And when I pull the camera now

1301
00:39:03,646 --> 00:39:06,506
in this direction, it really

1302
00:39:07,566 --> 00:39:09,056
produces a pleasing sort of

1303
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:11,066
prominent effect on that central

1304
00:39:11,106 --> 00:39:11,956
group of flowers.

1305
00:39:12,746 --> 00:39:14,246
So let's take a look now at how

1306
00:39:14,436 --> 00:39:15,046
we implemented this.

1307
00:39:15,046 --> 00:39:16,396
Because of the true 3-D nature

1308
00:39:16,396 --> 00:39:19,166
of this problem, we turned to

1309
00:39:19,166 --> 00:39:22,046
Metal as a true 3-D tool to

1310
00:39:22,656 --> 00:39:24,546
solve this effect, to produce

1311
00:39:24,546 --> 00:39:24,996
the effect.

1312
00:39:25,436 --> 00:39:27,216
We were able to get our system

1313
00:39:27,216 --> 00:39:28,636
up and running quite quickly in

1314
00:39:28,636 --> 00:39:30,116
Metal because of all the work

1315
00:39:30,116 --> 00:39:31,816
that it does for us.

1316
00:39:32,106 --> 00:39:34,876
Basically all we had to do to

1317
00:39:34,876 --> 00:39:36,686
start off with was to construct

1318
00:39:36,686 --> 00:39:38,526
a triangular mesh that we mapped

1319
00:39:38,646 --> 00:39:40,696
onto the image, much like what

1320
00:39:40,696 --> 00:39:42,136
you saw in Craig's Depth

1321
00:39:42,136 --> 00:39:43,926
Explorer demo at the beginning

1322
00:39:43,926 --> 00:39:44,496
of the session.

1323
00:39:45,156 --> 00:39:47,496
And we mapped the -- excuse me

1324
00:39:47,496 --> 00:39:49,036
-- we mapped the image -- we

1325
00:39:49,036 --> 00:39:50,126
center the image around the

1326
00:39:50,126 --> 00:39:50,576
origin.

1327
00:39:52,396 --> 00:39:54,106
Metal also gives us the

1328
00:39:54,106 --> 00:39:55,686
opportunity to program a couple

1329
00:39:55,686 --> 00:39:57,446
of stages of its pipeline, one

1330
00:39:57,446 --> 00:39:58,776
of which is the vertex shader.

1331
00:39:59,166 --> 00:40:00,156
And the job of the vertex

1332
00:39:59,166 --> 00:40:00,156
And the job of the vertex

1333
00:40:00,156 --> 00:40:01,726
shader, it gives us the

1334
00:40:01,726 --> 00:40:03,056
opportunity to process the

1335
00:40:03,056 --> 00:40:04,626
geometry of the scene in some

1336
00:40:04,626 --> 00:40:04,846
way.

1337
00:40:06,326 --> 00:40:07,786
And we can also program the

1338
00:40:07,786 --> 00:40:09,456
fragment shader, which gives us

1339
00:40:09,456 --> 00:40:11,226
the opportunity to produce a

1340
00:40:11,536 --> 00:40:13,246
color for each pixel in the

1341
00:40:13,246 --> 00:40:13,656
output.

1342
00:40:14,636 --> 00:40:17,106
We were able to reintegrate all

1343
00:40:17,106 --> 00:40:18,746
of this 3-D Metal rendering back

1344
00:40:18,746 --> 00:40:20,556
into our Core Image pipeline by

1345
00:40:20,556 --> 00:40:22,176
using a CI Image Processor

1346
00:40:22,176 --> 00:40:22,586
Kernel.

1347
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:26,866
So here's the code for the

1348
00:40:26,866 --> 00:40:27,606
vertex shader.

1349
00:40:30,166 --> 00:40:31,436
Again, the job of the vertex

1350
00:40:31,436 --> 00:40:32,446
shader is to process the

1351
00:40:32,446 --> 00:40:33,146
geometry.

1352
00:40:33,236 --> 00:40:34,576
And it does so one vertex at a

1353
00:40:34,576 --> 00:40:34,956
time.

1354
00:40:35,336 --> 00:40:36,836
So we get one vertex of the

1355
00:40:36,836 --> 00:40:38,116
original mesh as input.

1356
00:40:38,866 --> 00:40:39,956
And then we'll produce something

1357
00:40:39,956 --> 00:40:40,756
new on the output.

1358
00:40:41,076 --> 00:40:42,546
The first thing we do in the

1359
00:40:42,546 --> 00:40:45,166
vertex shader is sample the

1360
00:40:45,166 --> 00:40:46,936
depth at that vertex.

1361
00:40:47,756 --> 00:40:48,906
That's this line you see here.

1362
00:40:48,906 --> 00:40:50,296
We're storing it in a variable

1363
00:40:50,296 --> 00:40:51,846
called z, which will get used in

1364
00:40:51,846 --> 00:40:52,856
a couple of places in this

1365
00:40:52,856 --> 00:40:53,206
shader.

1366
00:40:54,246 --> 00:40:56,286
The first of which is this

1367
00:40:56,286 --> 00:40:57,526
magical line right here.

1368
00:40:57,946 --> 00:40:59,586
This line is the line that every

1369
00:40:59,586 --> 00:41:01,136
young engineer grows up dreaming

1370
00:40:59,586 --> 00:41:01,136
young engineer grows up dreaming

1371
00:41:01,136 --> 00:41:02,156
that they'll write some day.

1372
00:41:02,296 --> 00:41:03,796
Because this is where we do the

1373
00:41:03,796 --> 00:41:03,926
math.

1374
00:41:05,576 --> 00:41:07,136
There are three variables as

1375
00:41:07,136 --> 00:41:09,796
input to this equation.

1376
00:41:10,776 --> 00:41:12,066
One is the depth, which we just

1377
00:41:12,066 --> 00:41:12,746
sampled above.

1378
00:41:13,136 --> 00:41:14,416
And the others correspond to the

1379
00:41:14,416 --> 00:41:17,146
user inputs of the focal plane

1380
00:41:17,146 --> 00:41:18,696
and the camera's configuration.

1381
00:41:20,386 --> 00:41:22,816
This produces a scale factor,

1382
00:41:23,076 --> 00:41:24,896
which we can apply to our

1383
00:41:25,616 --> 00:41:28,466
vertices, which we do on this

1384
00:41:28,466 --> 00:41:29,106
line right here.

1385
00:41:29,106 --> 00:41:31,236
And we can apply a scale factor

1386
00:41:31,236 --> 00:41:33,466
to it because the vertices are

1387
00:41:33,466 --> 00:41:35,446
centered around the origin.

1388
00:41:35,976 --> 00:41:37,976
So this scale factor serves to

1389
00:41:38,286 --> 00:41:40,376
move vertices either radially

1390
00:41:40,376 --> 00:41:41,766
away from the center or toward

1391
00:41:41,766 --> 00:41:42,676
the center of the image.

1392
00:41:43,346 --> 00:41:44,736
And this is what produces the

1393
00:41:44,736 --> 00:41:46,516
illusion of three dimensions.

1394
00:41:47,526 --> 00:41:49,316
Once we have transformed our

1395
00:41:49,316 --> 00:41:51,206
vertex position, we output it

1396
00:41:51,206 --> 00:41:52,826
here in the new output vertex

1397
00:41:53,446 --> 00:41:54,586
while preserving the original

1398
00:41:54,586 --> 00:41:55,916
depth value, z.

1399
00:41:56,306 --> 00:41:57,846
And this is important because it

1400
00:41:57,846 --> 00:41:59,316
will get passed into the z

1401
00:41:59,316 --> 00:42:01,016
buffer machinery of Metal, which

1402
00:41:59,316 --> 00:42:01,016
buffer machinery of Metal, which

1403
00:42:01,016 --> 00:42:02,146
will then just do the right

1404
00:42:02,146 --> 00:42:03,596
thing for us as pixels move

1405
00:42:03,596 --> 00:42:04,756
around in the output and start

1406
00:42:04,756 --> 00:42:05,686
to overlap each other.

1407
00:42:07,846 --> 00:42:09,726
Also, we output the texture

1408
00:42:09,726 --> 00:42:10,886
coordinate of the original

1409
00:42:10,886 --> 00:42:11,426
vertex.

1410
00:42:12,206 --> 00:42:13,046
This will get used by the

1411
00:42:13,046 --> 00:42:14,976
fragment shader, which I'll show

1412
00:42:14,976 --> 00:42:16,556
you now.

1413
00:42:17,886 --> 00:42:18,936
Remember, the fragment shader's

1414
00:42:18,936 --> 00:42:21,516
job is to produce a color pixel

1415
00:42:21,516 --> 00:42:21,946
output.

1416
00:42:24,386 --> 00:42:26,566
And since Metal interpolates all

1417
00:42:26,566 --> 00:42:28,476
of these texture coordinates for

1418
00:42:28,476 --> 00:42:30,316
us, all we have to do in our

1419
00:42:30,316 --> 00:42:32,206
fragment shader is to sample the

1420
00:42:32,206 --> 00:42:33,586
original image at the

1421
00:42:33,586 --> 00:42:34,846
interpolated texture coordinate.

1422
00:42:35,456 --> 00:42:36,346
And that's it.

1423
00:42:36,346 --> 00:42:37,516
That's really all the code you

1424
00:42:37,516 --> 00:42:39,476
need to see to implement the

1425
00:42:39,476 --> 00:42:40,336
dolly zoom effect.

1426
00:42:40,646 --> 00:42:41,796
And hopefully it's given you

1427
00:42:41,796 --> 00:42:44,296
some ideas of new directions you

1428
00:42:44,296 --> 00:42:45,916
can take this in to produce your

1429
00:42:45,916 --> 00:42:47,586
own brand new custom 3-D

1430
00:42:47,586 --> 00:42:48,086
effects.

1431
00:42:48,446 --> 00:42:49,696
We're really excited to see what

1432
00:42:49,696 --> 00:42:50,236
you come up with.

1433
00:42:51,016 --> 00:42:53,486
And now, I'll hand the stage

1434
00:42:53,486 --> 00:42:55,976
back over to Etienne to finish

1435
00:42:55,976 --> 00:42:56,116
up.

1437

[ Applause ]

1438
00:43:01,926 --> 00:43:02,776
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Stephen.

1439
00:43:03,766 --> 00:43:04,506
All right.

1440
00:43:05,086 --> 00:43:06,666
So now that we've applied

1441
00:43:06,666 --> 00:43:08,396
various new effects to our

1442
00:43:08,396 --> 00:43:10,346
images, there's one more step

1443
00:43:10,346 --> 00:43:11,056
that we need to take.

1444
00:43:11,636 --> 00:43:16,346
And that's save your depth data.

1445
00:43:16,446 --> 00:43:18,576
So, you should always preserve

1446
00:43:18,576 --> 00:43:19,456
the depth data.

1447
00:43:19,456 --> 00:43:20,756
All right?

1448
00:43:20,986 --> 00:43:23,196
That way your users will be able

1449
00:43:23,196 --> 00:43:25,126
to use other apps like yours to

1450
00:43:25,126 --> 00:43:26,686
apply their own depth effects on

1451
00:43:26,686 --> 00:43:27,456
top of yours.

1452
00:43:28,636 --> 00:43:29,966
Even if you don't use the depth

1453
00:43:29,966 --> 00:43:31,736
data, you should always preserve

1454
00:43:31,736 --> 00:43:33,116
it if it was present in your

1455
00:43:33,116 --> 00:43:33,926
original image.

1456
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:37,256
This will really ensure the best

1457
00:43:37,256 --> 00:43:38,546
possible experience for your

1458
00:43:38,546 --> 00:43:39,046
users.

1459
00:43:39,736 --> 00:43:41,546
However, when you store the

1460
00:43:41,546 --> 00:43:43,406
depth data, be sure to match the

1461
00:43:43,406 --> 00:43:45,466
geometry of image data.

1462
00:43:46,666 --> 00:43:47,916
If you don't apply geometry

1463
00:43:47,916 --> 00:43:50,086
correctly, the depth data will

1464
00:43:50,086 --> 00:43:51,496
no longer match the image data.

1465
00:43:51,866 --> 00:43:53,486
And so further depth effect

1466
00:43:53,486 --> 00:43:55,056
applied on top of that will no

1467
00:43:55,056 --> 00:43:55,896
longer work properly.

1468
00:43:56,756 --> 00:43:59,046
So let's take a look at how the

1469
00:43:59,046 --> 00:44:00,286
kind of geometry transforming

1470
00:43:59,046 --> 00:44:00,286
kind of geometry transforming

1471
00:44:00,286 --> 00:44:02,386
might apply to depth data.

1472
00:44:03,656 --> 00:44:06,426
A very common operation is

1473
00:44:06,426 --> 00:44:07,016
orientation.

1474
00:44:07,556 --> 00:44:09,206
Often times you get to work with

1475
00:44:09,206 --> 00:44:10,436
a portrait image that was

1476
00:44:10,436 --> 00:44:11,976
actually shot in landscape and

1477
00:44:11,976 --> 00:44:13,576
has an [inaudible] orientation.

1478
00:44:14,996 --> 00:44:16,816
So, the depth data may look like

1479
00:44:16,816 --> 00:44:17,156
this.

1480
00:44:17,476 --> 00:44:19,606
And so you want to make sure to

1481
00:44:19,606 --> 00:44:21,136
orient the depth as well.

1482
00:44:21,466 --> 00:44:22,346
So make sure to apply

1483
00:44:22,346 --> 00:44:22,946
orientation.

1484
00:44:23,956 --> 00:44:26,136
Another very common operation is

1485
00:44:26,136 --> 00:44:26,476
crop.

1486
00:44:27,036 --> 00:44:29,306
Right? And so again, make sure

1487
00:44:29,306 --> 00:44:31,436
you crop the depth data to

1488
00:44:31,436 --> 00:44:31,896
match.

1489
00:44:33,546 --> 00:44:34,936
Now, you may have a more

1490
00:44:34,936 --> 00:44:36,246
advanced transform that you also

1491
00:44:36,246 --> 00:44:38,076
apply to your image such as

1492
00:44:38,266 --> 00:44:39,536
[inaudible] transform like this

1493
00:44:39,536 --> 00:44:39,666
one.

1494
00:44:40,826 --> 00:44:42,086
Right? Or maybe you have a

1495
00:44:42,086 --> 00:44:43,306
custom [inaudible] transform

1496
00:44:43,516 --> 00:44:45,276
such as a perspective transform.

1497
00:44:45,526 --> 00:44:47,196
Or maybe even a 3-D transform

1498
00:44:47,196 --> 00:44:48,786
like the one we saw in the dolly

1499
00:44:48,786 --> 00:44:49,256
zoom demo.

1500
00:44:50,926 --> 00:44:52,566
In any case, you want to also

1501
00:44:52,566 --> 00:44:53,926
apply the same transform to the

1502
00:44:53,926 --> 00:44:55,486
depth data so that it matches

1503
00:44:55,486 --> 00:44:56,476
the image perfectly.

1504
00:44:59,556 --> 00:45:01,486
Okay. So the key thing to

1505
00:44:59,556 --> 00:45:01,486
Okay. So the key thing to

1506
00:45:01,486 --> 00:45:03,156
remember here is to apply your

1507
00:45:03,156 --> 00:45:04,506
transform at the native

1508
00:45:04,506 --> 00:45:06,096
resolution of the depth data.

1509
00:45:06,966 --> 00:45:08,576
So you want to scale your

1510
00:45:08,576 --> 00:45:09,746
transform parameter from the

1511
00:45:09,746 --> 00:45:12,286
full size image to that size of

1512
00:45:12,326 --> 00:45:16,566
the depth image.

1513
00:45:17,116 --> 00:45:19,526
Otherwise, right, your transform

1514
00:45:19,566 --> 00:45:20,836
will be applied incorrectly.

1515
00:45:20,836 --> 00:45:22,366
And then the depth image will no

1516
00:45:22,366 --> 00:45:25,076
longer match the image, the

1517
00:45:25,076 --> 00:45:25,706
output image.

1518
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:28,556
Another thing to note is that

1519
00:45:28,776 --> 00:45:30,216
depth data is not color data.

1520
00:45:30,216 --> 00:45:31,756
So when you are rending a new

1521
00:45:31,756 --> 00:45:33,576
depth image, make sure you don't

1522
00:45:33,896 --> 00:45:35,126
apply any kind of color match

1523
00:45:35,126 --> 00:45:38,296
into it.

1524
00:45:38,296 --> 00:45:38,546
All right.

1525
00:45:39,816 --> 00:45:41,456
So now that we've seen what kind

1526
00:45:41,456 --> 00:45:43,116
of transform we may apply to

1527
00:45:43,116 --> 00:45:45,286
depth data we can render it into

1528
00:45:45,286 --> 00:45:46,496
a new CV pixel buffer.

1529
00:45:47,336 --> 00:45:48,856
Once we have a new CV pixel

1530
00:45:48,856 --> 00:45:50,966
buffer we can create a new AV

1531
00:45:50,966 --> 00:45:52,056
depth data object from it.

1532
00:45:52,326 --> 00:45:52,776
Here's how.

1533
00:45:53,466 --> 00:45:54,856
We start from our original depth

1534
00:45:54,856 --> 00:45:56,696
data object and then we call

1535
00:45:56,696 --> 00:45:58,266
Depth Data by replacing Depth

1536
00:45:58,266 --> 00:45:58,726
Data Map.

1537
00:45:59,046 --> 00:46:00,166
And we pass in all newly

1538
00:45:59,046 --> 00:46:00,166
And we pass in all newly

1539
00:46:00,166 --> 00:46:01,306
rendered depth buffer.

1540
00:46:02,346 --> 00:46:04,836
Now returns a new AV depth data

1541
00:46:04,836 --> 00:46:05,356
object.

1542
00:46:05,356 --> 00:46:07,096
And we can then save into our

1543
00:46:07,176 --> 00:46:08,376
output image.

1544
00:46:09,256 --> 00:46:10,326
Let's a take a look at how to

1545
00:46:10,326 --> 00:46:12,186
write depth data using Image IO.

1546
00:46:14,176 --> 00:46:16,676
We start from an image

1547
00:46:16,676 --> 00:46:18,356
destination that we create for

1548
00:46:18,356 --> 00:46:19,076
our output file.

1549
00:46:20,776 --> 00:46:22,116
And here we ask for a JPEG

1550
00:46:22,116 --> 00:46:22,596
format.

1551
00:46:22,906 --> 00:46:24,306
So please note that not all

1552
00:46:24,306 --> 00:46:25,396
image from that [inaudible]

1553
00:46:25,396 --> 00:46:27,196
depth, but JPEG does.

1554
00:46:28,496 --> 00:46:30,196
Next we add our output image to

1555
00:46:30,196 --> 00:46:31,226
the image destination.

1556
00:46:33,756 --> 00:46:35,526
And then we ask all depth data

1557
00:46:35,526 --> 00:46:36,756
object that we want to store

1558
00:46:36,756 --> 00:46:38,856
into the image for a dictionary

1559
00:46:38,856 --> 00:46:40,336
representation for the auxiliary

1560
00:46:40,336 --> 00:46:41,606
data to store in the file.

1561
00:46:42,376 --> 00:46:43,286
So this is will return the

1562
00:46:43,286 --> 00:46:44,966
dictionary for the auxiliary

1563
00:46:44,966 --> 00:46:46,816
data as well as by reference the

1564
00:46:46,816 --> 00:46:48,266
type of the auxiliary data to

1565
00:46:48,266 --> 00:46:48,636
store.

1566
00:46:49,906 --> 00:46:51,786
Then we ask the CG image

1567
00:46:51,786 --> 00:46:52,866
destination to add that

1568
00:46:52,866 --> 00:46:54,546
auxiliary data, passing in the

1569
00:46:54,546 --> 00:46:55,756
type and the dictionary.

1570
00:46:56,866 --> 00:46:58,436
And finally, all we have to do

1571
00:46:58,436 --> 00:46:59,886
is to call CG image destination

1572
00:46:59,886 --> 00:47:01,206
finalized to write everything

1573
00:46:59,886 --> 00:47:01,206
finalized to write everything

1574
00:47:01,206 --> 00:47:01,786
down to disk.

1575
00:47:03,676 --> 00:47:04,896
If you're working with Core

1576
00:47:04,896 --> 00:47:07,116
Image, there's a new very

1577
00:47:07,116 --> 00:47:09,256
convenient way you can do this

1578
00:47:10,086 --> 00:47:10,576
as well.

1579
00:47:10,826 --> 00:47:13,096
So, if you are using CI context

1580
00:47:13,096 --> 00:47:14,316
[inaudible] with image

1581
00:47:14,436 --> 00:47:16,936
representation for a particular

1582
00:47:16,936 --> 00:47:18,996
CI image directly in order to

1583
00:47:18,996 --> 00:47:20,996
render and save to a JPEG file,

1584
00:47:21,566 --> 00:47:24,746
you may now pass in using an

1585
00:47:24,746 --> 00:47:26,806
option key a depth data object

1586
00:47:26,806 --> 00:47:28,116
that you want to store as part

1587
00:47:28,116 --> 00:47:28,646
of that file.

1588
00:47:30,626 --> 00:47:33,566
Even better, if you have an

1589
00:47:33,566 --> 00:47:35,926
image, a depth image that you

1590
00:47:35,926 --> 00:47:36,796
have -- let's say you have

1591
00:47:36,796 --> 00:47:37,926
applied a transform to it or

1592
00:47:37,926 --> 00:47:38,336
something.

1593
00:47:38,826 --> 00:47:42,516
You can also specify it as an

1594
00:47:42,516 --> 00:47:44,926
option to that method so that

1595
00:47:45,836 --> 00:47:47,526
Core Image will render both the

1596
00:47:47,526 --> 00:47:48,926
regular image and the depth

1597
00:47:48,926 --> 00:47:50,636
image and save everything down

1598
00:47:51,156 --> 00:47:52,966
to the file in one call.

1599
00:47:53,296 --> 00:47:54,036
Very convenient.

1600
00:47:55,566 --> 00:47:56,106
And so that's it.

1601
00:47:56,106 --> 00:47:57,636
That concludes our session on

1602
00:47:57,786 --> 00:47:59,116
editing images with depth.

1603
00:48:00,106 --> 00:48:01,156
So, let's recap what we've

1604
00:48:01,156 --> 00:48:01,656
learned today.

1605
00:48:03,116 --> 00:48:05,216
We've learned what depth is and

1606
00:48:05,216 --> 00:48:06,496
what depth and disparity looks

1607
00:48:06,496 --> 00:48:06,766
like.

1608
00:48:09,086 --> 00:48:10,686
We've learned how to read and

1609
00:48:10,686 --> 00:48:12,236
prepare depth data for editing.

1610
00:48:13,096 --> 00:48:16,366
And then we saw several ways,

1611
00:48:16,366 --> 00:48:17,426
and we showed you several ways

1612
00:48:17,426 --> 00:48:19,546
to apply new depth effects to

1613
00:48:19,546 --> 00:48:20,206
your images.

1614
00:48:20,556 --> 00:48:21,786
The first one was background

1615
00:48:21,786 --> 00:48:23,946
effects using a built in Core

1616
00:48:23,946 --> 00:48:24,626
Image filter.

1617
00:48:25,286 --> 00:48:26,706
Then we had a custom darkness

1618
00:48:26,706 --> 00:48:28,626
effect using a custom Core Image

1619
00:48:28,626 --> 00:48:29,006
kernel.

1620
00:48:29,956 --> 00:48:31,226
And then we showed you how you

1621
00:48:31,226 --> 00:48:33,186
can apply your depth effect

1622
00:48:33,486 --> 00:48:35,356
using a new CI filter.

1623
00:48:36,546 --> 00:48:37,946
And then we saw how you can

1624
00:48:37,946 --> 00:48:40,416
create a brand new 3-D effect

1625
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:41,256
using depth.

1626
00:48:42,026 --> 00:48:43,616
I hope that this session will

1627
00:48:43,616 --> 00:48:45,306
inspire you to use depth data

1628
00:48:45,346 --> 00:48:46,626
into your own applications.

1629
00:48:46,856 --> 00:48:47,926
And I can't wait to see what

1630
00:48:47,926 --> 00:48:48,816
cool effects you'll come up

1631
00:48:48,816 --> 00:48:48,996
with.

1632
00:48:49,616 --> 00:48:51,586
For more information, please go

1633
00:48:51,586 --> 00:48:52,936
to the [inaudible] at Apple.com.

1634
00:48:54,556 --> 00:48:55,776
We have a couple related

1635
00:48:55,776 --> 00:48:56,356
sessions.

1636
00:48:56,696 --> 00:48:58,916
There's a session on Advances in

1637
00:48:58,916 --> 00:49:00,286
Core Image that's going to take

1638
00:48:58,916 --> 00:49:00,286
Core Image that's going to take

1639
00:49:00,286 --> 00:49:01,316
place later today.

1640
00:49:01,366 --> 00:49:02,886
So we strongly encourage you to

1641
00:49:02,956 --> 00:49:03,366
go there.

1642
00:49:03,906 --> 00:49:04,456
Check it out.

1643
00:49:04,456 --> 00:49:06,696
And there was a couple of

1644
00:49:06,696 --> 00:49:08,676
session yesterday was doing

1645
00:49:08,676 --> 00:49:11,196
Photo Kit and also how to

1646
00:49:11,196 --> 00:49:12,826
capture depth with iPhone.

1647
00:49:13,486 --> 00:49:15,376
And with that, I hope that you

1648
00:49:15,376 --> 00:49:17,256
have a good rest of the WWDC.

1649
00:49:17,516 --> 00:49:18,266
Thank you very much.
