00:00:17,526 --> 00:00:19,326
&gt;&gt; Welcome, my name is Eryk

2
00:00:19,326 --> 00:00:21,236
Vershen, I'm am AVFoundation

3
00:00:21,236 --> 00:00:22,166
engineer at Apple.

4
00:00:22,936 --> 00:00:25,006
This is session 515 which is

5
00:00:25,006 --> 00:00:27,286
about HLS authoring and the HLS

6
00:00:27,286 --> 00:00:27,686
tools.

7
00:00:28,966 --> 00:00:31,686
HLS is an abbreviation for HTTP

8
00:00:31,686 --> 00:00:32,466
Live Streaming.

9
00:00:32,896 --> 00:00:34,696
HLS is the way you stream

10
00:00:34,696 --> 00:00:36,916
content to all Apple devices.

11
00:00:37,816 --> 00:00:38,936
I'm going to be talking about

12
00:00:38,936 --> 00:00:40,456
the document HLS Authoring

13
00:00:40,456 --> 00:00:42,596
Specification for Apple Devices

14
00:00:42,996 --> 00:00:44,366
and the tools we distribute for

15
00:00:44,366 --> 00:00:45,996
creating and validating HLS

16
00:00:45,996 --> 00:00:46,526
content.

17
00:00:48,636 --> 00:00:50,356
The Authoring Specification and

18
00:00:50,406 --> 00:00:52,316
other important documents about

19
00:00:52,316 --> 00:00:53,906
HLS can be found at this URL

20
00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:56,776
developer.apple.com/streaming.

21
00:00:57,486 --> 00:00:59,326
The Authoring Specification is

22
00:00:59,326 --> 00:01:01,336
Apple's advice for authoring HLS

23
00:00:59,326 --> 00:01:01,336
Apple's advice for authoring HLS

24
00:01:01,336 --> 00:01:01,866
content.

25
00:01:03,026 --> 00:01:04,756
We wanted the HLS specification,

26
00:01:04,876 --> 00:01:06,126
the Internet draft, to include

27
00:01:06,126 --> 00:01:07,676
only absolutely necessary

28
00:01:07,676 --> 00:01:08,486
requirements.

29
00:01:09,246 --> 00:01:10,626
The Authoring Specification, on

30
00:01:10,626 --> 00:01:11,756
the other hand, includes

31
00:01:11,756 --> 00:01:12,996
requirements that are specific

32
00:01:12,996 --> 00:01:15,016
to Apple's players, as well as

33
00:01:15,016 --> 00:01:16,066
things that, while not

34
00:01:16,066 --> 00:01:17,906
absolutely required, are part of

35
00:01:17,906 --> 00:01:18,726
best practice.

36
00:01:19,316 --> 00:01:23,016
The big news this year is we've

37
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:24,726
added support for HEVC.

38
00:01:26,136 --> 00:01:27,406
Here are the limits on what is

39
00:01:27,406 --> 00:01:27,896
playable.

40
00:01:28,306 --> 00:01:31,776
Main 10 Profile, Level 5.0, High

41
00:01:31,776 --> 00:01:32,116
Tier.

42
00:01:32,726 --> 00:01:36,036
Now that we support HEVC content

43
00:01:36,356 --> 00:01:37,746
we've added bit rate guidelines

44
00:01:37,746 --> 00:01:38,516
for that as well.

45
00:01:39,526 --> 00:01:40,136
You should treat those

46
00:01:40,136 --> 00:01:41,326
recommendations as very

47
00:01:41,326 --> 00:01:41,966
preliminary.

48
00:01:42,556 --> 00:01:44,336
HEVC encoders are still

49
00:01:44,336 --> 00:01:46,196
evolving, we expect to see

50
00:01:46,196 --> 00:01:47,856
improvements over time so we may

51
00:01:47,856 --> 00:01:49,116
revise our guidelines in the

52
00:01:49,116 --> 00:01:49,606
future.

53
00:01:50,996 --> 00:01:52,076
You should also remember that

54
00:01:52,076 --> 00:01:53,446
the bit rate recommendations in

55
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:54,526
the Authoring Specification are

56
00:01:54,526 --> 00:01:56,226
guidelines, they are not cast in

57
00:01:56,226 --> 00:01:56,636
stone.

58
00:01:57,506 --> 00:01:59,106
We are aware that all content is

59
00:01:59,106 --> 00:02:00,816
different, a bit rate that works

60
00:01:59,106 --> 00:02:00,816
different, a bit rate that works

61
00:02:00,816 --> 00:02:01,806
for a video of two people

62
00:02:01,806 --> 00:02:03,726
talking is not likely to work

63
00:02:03,726 --> 00:02:04,656
for a sporting event.

64
00:02:05,266 --> 00:02:06,366
And you may have different

65
00:02:06,366 --> 00:02:07,446
constraints on the number of bit

66
00:02:07,446 --> 00:02:08,346
rate variants that you can

67
00:02:08,346 --> 00:02:08,806
provide.

68
00:02:09,246 --> 00:02:10,686
So, use the bit rate guidelines

69
00:02:10,686 --> 00:02:11,606
as a starting point.

70
00:02:12,676 --> 00:02:14,486
Having HEVC means that you can

71
00:02:14,486 --> 00:02:17,356
have both H.264 and HEVC content

72
00:02:17,356 --> 00:02:18,676
in the same master playlist.

73
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:20,516
So, we've come up with some best

74
00:02:20,516 --> 00:02:21,196
practices.

75
00:02:22,506 --> 00:02:24,696
First and most important, always

76
00:02:24,696 --> 00:02:26,086
use the CODECS attribute.

77
00:02:26,626 --> 00:02:28,006
You need this so that older

78
00:02:28,006 --> 00:02:29,356
players don't try to play the

79
00:02:29,356 --> 00:02:30,376
HEVC content.

80
00:02:32,156 --> 00:02:34,226
Second and almost as important,

81
00:02:34,226 --> 00:02:36,096
always include some H.264

82
00:02:36,096 --> 00:02:36,556
content.

83
00:02:37,156 --> 00:02:38,516
You need this so older players

84
00:02:38,516 --> 00:02:39,376
will have something that they

85
00:02:39,376 --> 00:02:39,796
can play.

86
00:02:41,716 --> 00:02:43,576
Now the player will switch

87
00:02:43,606 --> 00:02:46,496
between H.264 and HEVC.

88
00:02:46,496 --> 00:02:48,136
However, for two variants with

89
00:02:48,136 --> 00:02:49,486
similar bit rates the player

90
00:02:49,486 --> 00:02:50,926
will typically favor the HEVC

91
00:02:50,926 --> 00:02:51,446
content.

92
00:02:51,446 --> 00:02:54,526
While H.264 content could be in

93
00:02:54,526 --> 00:02:56,656
FMP4 files for maximum

94
00:02:56,656 --> 00:02:59,906
compatibility keep your H.264 in

95
00:02:59,906 --> 00:03:00,916
transport streams.

96
00:02:59,906 --> 00:03:00,916
transport streams.

97
00:03:01,136 --> 00:03:02,816
The last point I want to make is

98
00:03:02,816 --> 00:03:04,606
that these same rules apply to

99
00:03:04,606 --> 00:03:05,906
so-called trick play content,

100
00:03:06,016 --> 00:03:07,736
that is I-frame-only content.

101
00:03:08,726 --> 00:03:10,826
Along with adding HEVC support

102
00:03:10,826 --> 00:03:12,426
we also added support for a

103
00:03:12,426 --> 00:03:14,796
second subtitle format, IMSC.

104
00:03:15,766 --> 00:03:17,326
If you want more detail on our

105
00:03:17,326 --> 00:03:19,066
support for IMSC1 you should

106
00:03:19,066 --> 00:03:20,766
look at this year's Advances in

107
00:03:20,766 --> 00:03:22,286
HTTP Live Streaming talk.

108
00:03:23,406 --> 00:03:25,586
IMSC1 is based on TTML, the

109
00:03:25,586 --> 00:03:27,616
timed text markup language and

110
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:29,026
it's compatible with standards

111
00:03:29,096 --> 00:03:32,096
from the EBU and SMPTE.

112
00:03:32,606 --> 00:03:35,596
Let's talk about best practices

113
00:03:35,596 --> 00:03:37,086
for subtitle content.

114
00:03:37,976 --> 00:03:39,666
We support the text profile of

115
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:42,186
IMSC and note that IMSC content

116
00:03:42,186 --> 00:03:44,356
must be in fragmented MP4 files,

117
00:03:44,426 --> 00:03:46,046
you can't use plaintext files.

118
00:03:47,346 --> 00:03:49,176
WebVTT is the same as it has

119
00:03:49,206 --> 00:03:50,996
been, text files typically

120
00:03:50,996 --> 00:03:53,456
having an extension of .VTT or

121
00:03:53,456 --> 00:03:54,326
.webVTT.

122
00:03:55,126 --> 00:03:56,516
Remember that you can mix up

123
00:03:56,516 --> 00:04:00,556
IMSC and webVTT with H.264 HEVC

124
00:03:56,516 --> 00:04:00,556
IMSC and webVTT with H.264 HEVC

125
00:04:00,556 --> 00:04:02,006
content however you want,

126
00:04:02,206 --> 00:04:03,366
they're completely independent.

127
00:04:04,016 --> 00:04:06,336
You should always use the IMSC1

128
00:04:06,466 --> 00:04:07,426
CODECS value.

129
00:04:08,016 --> 00:04:09,576
Including that value ensures

130
00:04:09,576 --> 00:04:11,036
that older clients will ignore

131
00:04:11,036 --> 00:04:11,656
the variant.

132
00:04:11,896 --> 00:04:13,246
However, for maximum backward

133
00:04:13,246 --> 00:04:15,046
compatibilities don't put in the

134
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:16,875
value for the webVTT content.

135
00:04:17,406 --> 00:04:19,896
I want to change gears and talk

136
00:04:19,896 --> 00:04:21,266
about the HLS tools and the

137
00:04:21,266 --> 00:04:22,266
changes we've made there.

138
00:04:23,226 --> 00:04:24,416
The tools are available on the

139
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:25,916
developer site and you can find

140
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:27,666
them through the same URL I

141
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:28,546
mentioned earlier,

142
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:30,716
developer.apple.com/streaming.

143
00:04:32,246 --> 00:04:33,666
The tools fall into three rough

144
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:35,726
categories, tools for segmenting

145
00:04:35,726 --> 00:04:37,746
video and audio, tools for

146
00:04:37,746 --> 00:04:39,176
validating content and making

147
00:04:39,176 --> 00:04:41,526
validation reports and finally,

148
00:04:41,526 --> 00:04:43,296
tools for creating subtitles,

149
00:04:43,296 --> 00:04:44,446
iv3 metadata and master

150
00:04:44,446 --> 00:04:45,026
playlists.

151
00:04:45,756 --> 00:04:47,386
Now the validator does not do

152
00:04:47,386 --> 00:04:49,066
low-level bitstream checks, you

153
00:04:49,066 --> 00:04:50,236
should be using third-party

154
00:04:50,236 --> 00:04:51,536
tools if you think you may have

155
00:04:51,536 --> 00:04:53,006
issues with your encoders.

156
00:04:53,806 --> 00:04:54,576
Let's look at some of the

157
00:04:54,576 --> 00:04:57,186
specific changes we made in the

158
00:04:58,076 --> 00:04:58,216
tools.

159
00:04:58,396 --> 00:05:00,036
Well firstly, we've added the

160
00:04:58,396 --> 00:05:00,036
Well firstly, we've added the

161
00:05:00,036 --> 00:05:02,056
ability for MediaStreamValidator

162
00:05:02,056 --> 00:05:03,316
to check local files.

163
00:05:03,766 --> 00:05:04,846
You no longer have to put an

164
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:06,536
HTTP server to validate your

165
00:05:06,536 --> 00:05:07,176
streams.

166
00:05:08,206 --> 00:05:10,356
If you have direct file access

167
00:05:10,356 --> 00:05:11,776
you can check them that way and

168
00:05:11,776 --> 00:05:13,296
you can use relative paths,

169
00:05:13,296 --> 00:05:15,256
absolute paths or file URLs.

170
00:05:16,046 --> 00:05:17,476
However, I should note that you

171
00:05:17,476 --> 00:05:20,506
can't mix file URLs and HTTP,

172
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:21,896
that is if the master playlist

173
00:05:21,896 --> 00:05:23,666
is a file path then the media

174
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:26,016
playlist it references can't be

175
00:05:26,016 --> 00:05:27,166
HTTP URLs.

176
00:05:28,016 --> 00:05:29,646
Of course, we added support for

177
00:05:29,646 --> 00:05:31,256
HEVC into the tools.

178
00:05:32,296 --> 00:05:33,856
We've also made a lot of general

179
00:05:33,856 --> 00:05:35,046
improvements to the tools,

180
00:05:35,286 --> 00:05:35,776
principally the

181
00:05:35,776 --> 00:05:37,516
MediaStreamValidator and HLS

182
00:05:37,516 --> 00:05:37,936
report.

183
00:05:38,716 --> 00:05:39,886
We check more things about the

184
00:05:39,886 --> 00:05:40,446
stream.

185
00:05:40,796 --> 00:05:42,066
There are too many to list, but

186
00:05:42,066 --> 00:05:42,986
for example, we're now

187
00:05:42,986 --> 00:05:44,426
validating the CODEC usage.

188
00:05:45,506 --> 00:05:46,646
We have better handling for

189
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:47,876
errors on the stream during

190
00:05:47,876 --> 00:05:48,616
validation.

191
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:50,286
And we made the ordering of

192
00:05:50,286 --> 00:05:51,496
variants renditions in the

193
00:05:51,496 --> 00:05:53,486
reports be more consistent.

194
00:05:54,336 --> 00:05:57,046
We've added several new options,

195
00:05:57,046 --> 00:05:58,326
I want to call out just three of

196
00:05:58,326 --> 00:05:58,606
them.

197
00:05:59,786 --> 00:06:01,386
First, the description option on

198
00:05:59,786 --> 00:06:01,386
First, the description option on

199
00:06:01,386 --> 00:06:02,476
MediaStreamValidator.

200
00:06:03,516 --> 00:06:04,816
The URLs for a stream don't

201
00:06:04,816 --> 00:06:06,166
necessarily make clear what the

202
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:06,936
content is.

203
00:06:07,496 --> 00:06:08,696
This option allows you to add

204
00:06:08,696 --> 00:06:10,226
some text describing the stream.

205
00:06:10,576 --> 00:06:12,126
For example, such and such show,

206
00:06:12,126 --> 00:06:13,636
season two, episode five.

207
00:06:14,116 --> 00:06:15,386
The text will appear at the top

208
00:06:15,386 --> 00:06:16,656
of the report near the URL.

209
00:06:18,196 --> 00:06:20,786
For HLS report, we've added some

210
00:06:20,786 --> 00:06:22,076
new optional columns.

211
00:06:23,206 --> 00:06:24,376
Rather than continue the way we

212
00:06:24,376 --> 00:06:25,686
had previously with separate

213
00:06:25,686 --> 00:06:27,716
options for each column, instead

214
00:06:27,716 --> 00:06:29,216
we've added a columns option

215
00:06:29,386 --> 00:06:30,516
that takes a list of column and

216
00:06:30,516 --> 00:06:31,366
identifiers.

217
00:06:32,046 --> 00:06:33,386
The set of available column

218
00:06:33,386 --> 00:06:34,796
identifiers can be found using

219
00:06:34,796 --> 00:06:36,336
the Help option or in the

220
00:06:36,336 --> 00:06:36,796
[inaudible] page.

221
00:06:37,746 --> 00:06:39,916
The old id and pl options that

222
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:41,736
gave you data id values and

223
00:06:41,736 --> 00:06:42,896
playlist bit rates are still

224
00:06:42,896 --> 00:06:44,546
supported, but are deprecated in

225
00:06:44,546 --> 00:06:46,156
favor of column identifiers.

226
00:06:46,726 --> 00:06:47,986
And the column identifiers for

227
00:06:47,986 --> 00:06:49,966
those are just id and pl.

228
00:06:51,376 --> 00:06:53,956
Last year we added hdcp-level

229
00:06:53,956 --> 00:06:55,466
support, but we forgot to tell

230
00:06:55,466 --> 00:06:57,846
you about the hdcp-level option

231
00:06:57,846 --> 00:06:59,036
on MediaFileSegmenter.

232
00:06:59,816 --> 00:07:01,536
This allows you to set the

233
00:06:59,816 --> 00:07:01,536
This allows you to set the

234
00:07:01,536 --> 00:07:02,186
hdcp-level.

235
00:07:03,136 --> 00:07:05,066
The hdcp-level is included in

236
00:07:05,066 --> 00:07:06,656
the Plist that gets generated by

237
00:07:06,656 --> 00:07:07,746
MediaFileSegmenter.

238
00:07:08,486 --> 00:07:10,006
And you can pass that Plist to

239
00:07:10,006 --> 00:07:11,546
the variant playlist creator to

240
00:07:11,546 --> 00:07:13,846
get the hdcp-level attribute in

241
00:07:13,846 --> 00:07:15,396
the generated master playlist.

242
00:07:15,876 --> 00:07:19,356
Here's a quick look of a sample

243
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:19,816
report.

244
00:07:20,626 --> 00:07:23,556
Notice the second line, that's

245
00:07:23,556 --> 00:07:24,696
from the description option that

246
00:07:24,696 --> 00:07:25,226
we passed in

247
00:07:25,226 --> 00:07:26,306
MediaStreamValidator.

248
00:07:27,756 --> 00:07:28,956
And notice that we've now added

249
00:07:28,956 --> 00:07:31,206
a CODECS column so you can see

250
00:07:31,206 --> 00:07:34,766
which variants are H.264 and

251
00:07:35,576 --> 00:07:36,016
HEVC.

252
00:07:36,216 --> 00:07:37,226
Now we use the AVC, the

253
00:07:37,226 --> 00:07:40,426
alternate name of H.264 so that

254
00:07:40,426 --> 00:07:41,396
we'll have more visible

255
00:07:41,396 --> 00:07:42,886
separation between the two CODEC

256
00:07:42,886 --> 00:07:43,356
types.

257
00:07:45,516 --> 00:07:47,096
As part of the changes in the

258
00:07:47,096 --> 00:07:48,006
ordering of variants and

259
00:07:48,006 --> 00:07:50,506
renditions, we now keep audio,

260
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:52,126
closed caption and subtitle

261
00:07:52,126 --> 00:07:53,176
renditions separate.

262
00:07:54,366 --> 00:07:57,836
To summarize, remember that URL,

263
00:07:58,036 --> 00:08:00,266
developer.apple.com/streaming,

264
00:07:58,036 --> 00:08:00,266
developer.apple.com/streaming,

265
00:08:01,006 --> 00:08:02,246
everything you need to know is

266
00:08:02,246 --> 00:08:03,506
pointed to from that page.

267
00:08:04,106 --> 00:08:05,456
Besides the various documents it

268
00:08:05,456 --> 00:08:06,666
also has links to sample

269
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:08,506
streams, to the tools download,

270
00:08:09,136 --> 00:08:11,246
to past videos about HLS, the

271
00:08:11,246 --> 00:08:12,306
information about FairPlay

272
00:08:12,306 --> 00:08:14,126
Streaming and so on.

273
00:08:14,426 --> 00:08:16,556
I encourage you all to read the

274
00:08:16,556 --> 00:08:17,946
HLS Authoring Specification for

275
00:08:17,946 --> 00:08:20,306
Apple Devices and the HLS spec.

276
00:08:21,726 --> 00:08:23,496

277
00:08:23,496 --> 00:08:24,746
webpage for this talk,

developer.apple.com/WWDC17/515.

279
00:08:30,226 --> 00:08:34,596
We have some related video

280
00:08:34,596 --> 00:08:37,416
sessions, Advances in HTTP Live

281
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:37,946
Streaming.

282
00:08:39,775 --> 00:08:41,186
This has more discussion of HEVC

283
00:08:41,186 --> 00:08:43,645
and IMSC1, as well as some other

284
00:08:43,645 --> 00:08:44,636
interesting topics.

285
00:08:45,206 --> 00:08:46,706
And Error Handling Best

286
00:08:46,706 --> 00:08:48,356
Practices for HTTP Live

287
00:08:48,356 --> 00:08:48,806
Streaming.

288
00:08:48,806 --> 00:08:50,466
That will help you understand

289
00:08:50,466 --> 00:08:52,306
what your server needs to do to

290
00:08:52,306 --> 00:08:53,776
be a good HLS server.

291
00:08:54,586 --> 00:08:55,976
You can watch either of these

292
00:08:55,976 --> 00:08:57,836
videos via the web or in the

293
00:08:57,836 --> 00:08:59,066
WWDC app.

294
00:08:59,786 --> 00:09:01,136
I hope you found the talk

295
00:08:59,786 --> 00:09:01,136
I hope you found the talk

296
00:09:01,136 --> 00:09:02,436
useful, thanks for watching.
