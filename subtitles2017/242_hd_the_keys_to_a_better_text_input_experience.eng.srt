00:00:24,766 --> 00:00:25,426
&gt;&gt; Okay, thank you.

4
00:00:25,956 --> 00:00:26,366
Thank you.

5
00:00:26,826 --> 00:00:27,696
Good morning, everybody.

6
00:00:28,246 --> 00:00:29,096
My name is Kasia.

7
00:00:29,286 --> 00:00:30,366
I'm here with my colleagues,

8
00:00:30,366 --> 00:00:31,246
Shuchen and James.

9
00:00:31,556 --> 00:00:32,555
And we are here to hand you the

10
00:00:32,555 --> 00:00:33,986
keys to a better text input

11
00:00:33,986 --> 00:00:35,156
experience in your app.

12
00:00:35,246 --> 00:00:36,516
So, let's see what we're going

13
00:00:36,516 --> 00:00:37,236
to talk about today.

14
00:00:37,506 --> 00:00:39,246
We're going to start with

15
00:00:39,436 --> 00:00:40,686
integrating the keyboard into

16
00:00:40,686 --> 00:00:41,186
your layout.

17
00:00:41,596 --> 00:00:42,786
And we're also going to talk

18
00:00:42,786 --> 00:00:44,266
about creating dynamic and more

19
00:00:44,266 --> 00:00:45,556
interesting input accessory

20
00:00:45,556 --> 00:00:45,856
views.

21
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:47,876
We'll talk about making your app

22
00:00:48,316 --> 00:00:49,816
reach multilingual audiences,

23
00:00:50,586 --> 00:00:52,056
using traits to make predictive

24
00:00:52,056 --> 00:00:54,796
quick type smarter in your app.

25
00:00:54,796 --> 00:00:56,026
Supporting hardware keyboards.

26
00:00:56,666 --> 00:00:58,166
Creating custom input views.

27
00:00:58,686 --> 00:01:00,076
And finally, tips and best

28
00:00:58,686 --> 00:01:00,076
And finally, tips and best

29
00:01:00,076 --> 00:01:01,146
practices for keyboard

30
00:01:01,146 --> 00:01:01,736
extensions.

31
00:01:02,346 --> 00:01:03,526
So, I'm going to start with

32
00:01:03,526 --> 00:01:04,666
integrating the keyboard into

33
00:01:04,666 --> 00:01:04,965
your app.

34
00:01:05,846 --> 00:01:06,816
And for that, I'm going to show

35
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:08,286
you a screenshot of the app

36
00:01:08,286 --> 00:01:10,296
we've created for this talk.

37
00:01:10,296 --> 00:01:11,496
It's called CatChat.

38
00:01:11,496 --> 00:01:12,496
It's for talking with your pets.

39
00:01:13,416 --> 00:01:14,926
Not just cats, but in my case,

40
00:01:15,046 --> 00:01:16,446
just cats.

41
00:01:16,446 --> 00:01:18,436
And we do have this available as

42
00:01:18,436 --> 00:01:19,616
sample code so you can grab it

43
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:20,146
from the site.

44
00:01:20,476 --> 00:01:21,726
Cat pictures not included.

45
00:01:22,696 --> 00:01:25,026
So, let's get started with that.

46
00:01:25,026 --> 00:01:25,636
You're going to see a lot of

47
00:01:25,636 --> 00:01:26,246
this in the talk.

48
00:01:26,246 --> 00:01:27,786
And we're going to start with

49
00:01:27,786 --> 00:01:29,346
accounting for changing keyboard

50
00:01:29,346 --> 00:01:29,576
heights.

51
00:01:30,976 --> 00:01:32,706
So, keyboards come in different

52
00:01:32,706 --> 00:01:33,166
sizes.

53
00:01:34,216 --> 00:01:35,976
Depending on the language that

54
00:01:35,976 --> 00:01:37,326
the user is using and the

55
00:01:37,326 --> 00:01:38,446
settings that they've enabled,

56
00:01:39,026 --> 00:01:40,076
you might see different heights

57
00:01:40,606 --> 00:01:41,916
of the keyboards that are used

58
00:01:41,916 --> 00:01:42,296
in your app.

59
00:01:42,816 --> 00:01:44,626
The English keyboard, with the

60
00:01:44,626 --> 00:01:46,716
predictive bar, is one height,

61
00:01:47,266 --> 00:01:48,876
whereas the Polish keyboard is

62
00:01:48,876 --> 00:01:51,246
shorter, and the Chinese 10-key

63
00:01:51,246 --> 00:01:53,126
pinyin keyboard, is taller than

64
00:01:53,126 --> 00:01:53,726
both of those.

65
00:01:54,716 --> 00:01:56,066
And there are third party

66
00:01:56,066 --> 00:01:57,356
keyboards, which some of you may

67
00:01:57,356 --> 00:01:58,946
have even written, and those do

68
00:01:58,946 --> 00:02:00,246
not have a specific height

69
00:01:58,946 --> 00:02:00,246
not have a specific height

70
00:02:00,246 --> 00:02:00,846
requirement.

71
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:03,066
So, you're not ever guaranteed

72
00:02:03,066 --> 00:02:04,526
to get a specific height for a

73
00:02:04,526 --> 00:02:05,876
keyboard that a user is using in

74
00:02:05,876 --> 00:02:06,846
your app.

75
00:02:07,136 --> 00:02:08,216
So, how do you account for this?

76
00:02:09,256 --> 00:02:09,916
Well, we have a set of

77
00:02:09,916 --> 00:02:10,686
notifications.

78
00:02:11,586 --> 00:02:13,436
We tell you when the keyboard

79
00:02:13,436 --> 00:02:15,776
shows, when it hides, and when

80
00:02:15,776 --> 00:02:16,596
the frame changes.

81
00:02:17,136 --> 00:02:17,756
And for each of these

82
00:02:17,756 --> 00:02:18,896
notifications, we'll give you

83
00:02:18,896 --> 00:02:20,206
the beginning and ending frame

84
00:02:20,656 --> 00:02:21,916
that you get from the keyboard.

85
00:02:22,876 --> 00:02:24,756
Now before we go into how to

86
00:02:24,756 --> 00:02:25,546
work with that frame we're

87
00:02:25,546 --> 00:02:26,846
giving you, let's talk about a

88
00:02:26,846 --> 00:02:28,386
bit of a special case, and

89
00:02:28,386 --> 00:02:29,676
that's the undocked keyboard.

90
00:02:30,306 --> 00:02:33,106
In iPads, the user can actually

91
00:02:33,586 --> 00:02:34,786
lift the keyboard off the bottom

92
00:02:34,786 --> 00:02:36,216
of the screen, and move it

93
00:02:36,216 --> 00:02:37,586
around, as well as split it

94
00:02:37,586 --> 00:02:37,946
apart.

95
00:02:38,996 --> 00:02:41,126
In that instance, you generally

96
00:02:41,126 --> 00:02:42,736
don't want your app to be trying

97
00:02:42,736 --> 00:02:43,986
to stay on top of the keyboard,

98
00:02:43,986 --> 00:02:44,736
because they might move it all

99
00:02:44,736 --> 00:02:45,476
the way to the top of the

100
00:02:45,526 --> 00:02:46,766
screen, and then all your

101
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:47,846
content is gone and that's no

102
00:02:47,846 --> 00:02:48,146
fun.

103
00:02:48,706 --> 00:02:50,266
So, when the keyboard gets

104
00:02:50,266 --> 00:02:51,596
undocked, we will send you a

105
00:02:51,596 --> 00:02:53,316
"Hide" notification, just like

106
00:02:53,316 --> 00:02:54,816
we would if the keyboard was

107
00:02:54,816 --> 00:02:55,396
dismissed.

108
00:02:56,236 --> 00:02:58,066
In most cases, that's how you're

109
00:02:58,066 --> 00:02:58,986
going to handle it, as though

110
00:02:58,986 --> 00:03:00,086
the keyboard was dismissed.

111
00:02:58,986 --> 00:03:00,086
the keyboard was dismissed.

112
00:03:00,906 --> 00:03:01,956
If you do want to do something

113
00:03:01,956 --> 00:03:03,436
clever, we will continue sending

114
00:03:03,436 --> 00:03:05,016
you frame change notifications,

115
00:03:05,776 --> 00:03:07,736
but for most people, what you're

116
00:03:07,736 --> 00:03:09,286
going to want to do is track the

117
00:03:09,286 --> 00:03:10,756
most recent hide or show event,

118
00:03:11,576 --> 00:03:13,036
and then deal with the keyboard

119
00:03:13,036 --> 00:03:14,896
accordingly before you deal with

120
00:03:14,896 --> 00:03:15,636
any frame changes.

121
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:18,206
So, the undocked keyboard is

122
00:03:18,206 --> 00:03:19,066
something like this.

123
00:03:19,066 --> 00:03:20,176
We have this nice scroll view.

124
00:03:20,886 --> 00:03:22,306
And when the keyboard comes up,

125
00:03:22,486 --> 00:03:23,606
the scroll view compensates.

126
00:03:23,726 --> 00:03:25,296
When it's undocked, it takes up

127
00:03:25,296 --> 00:03:26,226
the full screen again.

128
00:03:26,806 --> 00:03:27,856
And when the user docks it

129
00:03:27,856 --> 00:03:29,726
again, it comes back up so that

130
00:03:29,726 --> 00:03:30,626
you can see the entire

131
00:03:30,626 --> 00:03:32,376
transcript of your delightful

132
00:03:32,376 --> 00:03:33,856
chat with your cat, which is

133
00:03:33,856 --> 00:03:34,256
important.

134
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:37,426
So, that's the kind of special

135
00:03:37,426 --> 00:03:37,846
case.

136
00:03:38,586 --> 00:03:40,086
So, let's move on to actually

137
00:03:40,116 --> 00:03:41,256
working with that frame

138
00:03:41,256 --> 00:03:42,456
notification that we give you.

139
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:44,306
First things first.

140
00:03:44,306 --> 00:03:45,616
The keyboard is always full

141
00:03:45,616 --> 00:03:45,976
screen.

142
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,626
It's always in the full screen

143
00:03:47,626 --> 00:03:48,486
coordinate space.

144
00:03:49,186 --> 00:03:51,146
So, the first thing you do when

145
00:03:51,146 --> 00:03:52,306
you get a keyboard frame from

146
00:03:52,306 --> 00:03:53,856
one of our notifications, is

147
00:03:53,856 --> 00:03:55,096
convert it from the frame -- the

148
00:03:55,096 --> 00:03:56,196
screen coordinates, to your

149
00:03:56,196 --> 00:03:57,656
local coordinates before you

150
00:03:57,656 --> 00:03:58,576
start working with anything

151
00:03:59,536 --> 00:03:59,636
else.

152
00:03:59,756 --> 00:04:01,636
Because the keyboard can be full

153
00:03:59,756 --> 00:04:01,636
Because the keyboard can be full

154
00:04:01,636 --> 00:04:03,476
screen when you are not, and

155
00:04:03,476 --> 00:04:04,686
because you can you know --

156
00:04:04,686 --> 00:04:05,516
there are all sorts of fun

157
00:04:05,516 --> 00:04:06,626
situations where keyboards come

158
00:04:06,626 --> 00:04:07,186
up and down.

159
00:04:07,506 --> 00:04:08,416
You always want to make sure to

160
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:09,236
do this first.

161
00:04:09,236 --> 00:04:11,126
You can't count on the frame

162
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:12,836
that you get being local to the

163
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:13,476
frame of your app.

164
00:04:13,846 --> 00:04:15,076
Think about multitasking, for

165
00:04:15,076 --> 00:04:15,436
instance.

166
00:04:16,736 --> 00:04:17,935
Then, if you do use the

167
00:04:17,935 --> 00:04:19,086
intersection of the frame that

168
00:04:19,086 --> 00:04:19,836
we give you once you've

169
00:04:19,836 --> 00:04:21,406
converted it, and the view you

170
00:04:21,406 --> 00:04:24,056
want to use, you can then get

171
00:04:24,056 --> 00:04:25,106
the difference in height between

172
00:04:25,106 --> 00:04:26,386
the two of those -- or the

173
00:04:26,386 --> 00:04:27,806
height of the keyboard as it

174
00:04:27,806 --> 00:04:29,746
will overlap your view, and use

175
00:04:29,746 --> 00:04:31,586
that to adjust for the keyboard.

176
00:04:32,456 --> 00:04:33,446
So, let's talk about a couple

177
00:04:33,446 --> 00:04:34,646
different kinds of layouts.

178
00:04:35,276 --> 00:04:36,576
Let's start with layouts that do

179
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:37,206
not scroll.

180
00:04:38,126 --> 00:04:40,496
So, static layouts are generally

181
00:04:40,496 --> 00:04:41,726
a couple of text views, maybe a

182
00:04:41,726 --> 00:04:43,536
button, where the user doesn't

183
00:04:43,536 --> 00:04:45,206
have to move around a lot in

184
00:04:45,206 --> 00:04:46,866
order to see everything in your

185
00:04:46,866 --> 00:04:47,136
view.

186
00:04:47,636 --> 00:04:48,616
But you still want it to look

187
00:04:48,616 --> 00:04:49,956
nice with all keyboards.

188
00:04:50,836 --> 00:04:52,226
In this instance, as an example,

189
00:04:52,446 --> 00:04:54,716
we have five text fields and

190
00:04:54,716 --> 00:04:56,046
they are tied together with UI

191
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:57,576
Layout Guides acting as spacers.

192
00:04:58,236 --> 00:04:59,246
AT the top of the view, they're

193
00:04:59,246 --> 00:05:01,116
using The Safe Area Edge Insets,

194
00:04:59,246 --> 00:05:01,116
using The Safe Area Edge Insets,

195
00:05:01,596 --> 00:05:03,206
and at the bottom -- well, we'll

196
00:05:03,206 --> 00:05:04,776
talk about that in a second, but

197
00:05:05,056 --> 00:05:06,446
the spacers change size

198
00:05:06,476 --> 00:05:08,156
depending on what keyboard

199
00:05:08,156 --> 00:05:10,446
appears, so that it always shows

200
00:05:10,446 --> 00:05:11,816
all five of the text views to

201
00:05:12,146 --> 00:05:12,706
the user.

202
00:05:13,876 --> 00:05:15,286
So, how did we do that?

203
00:05:15,676 --> 00:05:17,046
Well, we created a custom UI

204
00:05:17,046 --> 00:05:18,676
Layout Guide with a height

205
00:05:18,676 --> 00:05:20,446
constraint that we hold onto so

206
00:05:20,446 --> 00:05:21,546
that we can adjust it later.

207
00:05:22,036 --> 00:05:25,676
The Layout Guide gets tied to

208
00:05:25,676 --> 00:05:27,576
the bottom Safe Area Layout

209
00:05:27,576 --> 00:05:28,446
Guide of your view.

210
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:31,026
And the top of the Layout Guide

211
00:05:31,176 --> 00:05:32,556
should be tied to the bottom of

212
00:05:32,556 --> 00:05:34,316
the view or spacer that you want

213
00:05:34,316 --> 00:05:35,636
to appear directly on top of the

214
00:05:35,636 --> 00:05:37,256
keyboard, when the keyboard has

215
00:05:37,256 --> 00:05:37,696
appeared.

216
00:05:38,926 --> 00:05:40,176
Once you do that, you can do

217
00:05:40,176 --> 00:05:41,746
your height conversion after

218
00:05:41,746 --> 00:05:42,656
checking that the keyboard is

219
00:05:42,656 --> 00:05:44,626
visible, and simply set that

220
00:05:44,626 --> 00:05:46,036
height constraint you held onto,

221
00:05:46,366 --> 00:05:47,406
to the height of the keyboard.

222
00:05:48,266 --> 00:05:49,426
If you pop that into a view

223
00:05:49,426 --> 00:05:51,256
animation block with N call

224
00:05:51,256 --> 00:05:52,266
layout if needed, you'll get the

225
00:05:52,266 --> 00:05:53,626
cool little animation between

226
00:05:53,626 --> 00:05:55,226
the keyboards that you saw, just

227
00:05:55,226 --> 00:05:55,746
a moment ago.

228
00:05:56,706 --> 00:05:58,516
The more common case however,

229
00:05:58,606 --> 00:05:59,626
are scrolling layouts.

230
00:06:00,356 --> 00:06:01,666
Layouts embedded in the scroll

231
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:02,956
view so that the user can move

232
00:06:02,956 --> 00:06:04,556
between your views, and see

233
00:06:04,556 --> 00:06:05,336
everything that they need to

234
00:06:05,336 --> 00:06:05,646
see.

235
00:06:06,536 --> 00:06:07,446
In our case, we had this

236
00:06:07,526 --> 00:06:08,746
conversation View Controller in

237
00:06:08,746 --> 00:06:09,616
our Cat Chat app.

238
00:06:10,206 --> 00:06:11,076
And we want to make sure that

239
00:06:11,076 --> 00:06:11,936
you can scroll through the

240
00:06:11,936 --> 00:06:13,746
entire conversation at any time.

241
00:06:14,536 --> 00:06:16,156
So, we need to make sure that

242
00:06:16,156 --> 00:06:18,086
the bottom of the table view is

243
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:21,056
adjusted to how the entirety of

244
00:06:21,056 --> 00:06:22,296
your chat transcript.

245
00:06:23,246 --> 00:06:24,226
So, how do you do this?

246
00:06:24,906 --> 00:06:26,276
Very similar to before but a

247
00:06:26,276 --> 00:06:27,316
little less complicated.

248
00:06:27,616 --> 00:06:28,326
You simply make sure the

249
00:06:28,326 --> 00:06:30,356
keyboard's visible gain, do your

250
00:06:30,356 --> 00:06:31,666
frame conversion, get your

251
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:33,646
height, and set the content

252
00:06:33,646 --> 00:06:34,976
inset of the scroll view.

253
00:06:35,206 --> 00:06:36,666
This is where that intersection

254
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:38,096
bit is helpful because if you

255
00:06:38,096 --> 00:06:39,356
have a scroll view that does not

256
00:06:39,356 --> 00:06:40,976
take up the full screen, you

257
00:06:40,976 --> 00:06:42,256
only want to offset it by the

258
00:06:42,256 --> 00:06:43,266
bit that's covered by the

259
00:06:43,266 --> 00:06:43,716
keyboard.

260
00:06:44,766 --> 00:06:46,436
Finally, you do need to handle

261
00:06:46,536 --> 00:06:48,246
scrolling the content, once

262
00:06:48,246 --> 00:06:49,296
you've adjusted your scroll

263
00:06:49,296 --> 00:06:49,716
insets.

264
00:06:50,766 --> 00:06:52,076
In the previous example, we were

265
00:06:52,076 --> 00:06:53,646
actually using a UI Table View

266
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:55,806
Controller, which is even easier

267
00:06:56,436 --> 00:06:58,026
because it sets the insets for

268
00:06:58,026 --> 00:06:59,886
you, and all you have to do is

269
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:01,426
scroll the content, which is

270
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:01,426
scroll the content, which is

271
00:07:01,426 --> 00:07:01,766
nice.

272
00:07:01,766 --> 00:07:03,076
In this case, we have a table

273
00:07:03,076 --> 00:07:05,256
view and we want the most recent

274
00:07:05,256 --> 00:07:06,346
item to show right above the

275
00:07:06,346 --> 00:07:06,866
keyboard.

276
00:07:07,236 --> 00:07:08,416
So, we scroll the bottom cell,

277
00:07:08,796 --> 00:07:10,426
to the bottom of our inset table

278
00:07:10,426 --> 00:07:10,636
view.

279
00:07:11,576 --> 00:07:13,396
So, that is adjusting for the

280
00:07:13,396 --> 00:07:14,326
keyboard in your layout.

281
00:07:14,806 --> 00:07:16,056
Now, let's talk about extending

282
00:07:16,056 --> 00:07:17,486
the keyboard with an input

283
00:07:17,486 --> 00:07:18,196
accessory view.

284
00:07:19,016 --> 00:07:21,216
The input accessory view, is a

285
00:07:21,216 --> 00:07:22,386
view right above the keyboard.

286
00:07:22,446 --> 00:07:24,086
Here, it's a text view, and a

287
00:07:24,086 --> 00:07:24,436
button.

288
00:07:25,126 --> 00:07:26,356
IT can also be a tool bar with

289
00:07:26,356 --> 00:07:27,356
some navigation buttons.

290
00:07:27,486 --> 00:07:28,976
It can be a row of buttons.

291
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:31,046
If can a couple of cool little,

292
00:07:31,286 --> 00:07:32,346
you know, photos or something.

293
00:07:32,346 --> 00:07:33,526
Anything you want to put on

294
00:07:33,526 --> 00:07:35,056
there, you can because it's just

295
00:07:35,056 --> 00:07:35,486
a view.

296
00:07:36,346 --> 00:07:37,576
How do you add this to the

297
00:07:37,576 --> 00:07:38,066
keyboard?

298
00:07:38,276 --> 00:07:39,506
Well, here we have the -- an

299
00:07:39,506 --> 00:07:41,296
input accessory view in our chat

300
00:07:41,346 --> 00:07:42,846
conversation view controller.

301
00:07:43,646 --> 00:07:45,306
And so, it's the host view

302
00:07:45,306 --> 00:07:46,726
controller that wants to display

303
00:07:46,726 --> 00:07:47,576
the keyboard with the input

304
00:07:47,576 --> 00:07:48,396
accessory view.

305
00:07:49,226 --> 00:07:50,146
So, we make it part of the

306
00:07:50,146 --> 00:07:51,836
responder chain by returning

307
00:07:51,836 --> 00:07:53,116
True for, "Can become first

308
00:07:53,116 --> 00:07:54,896
responder," on our conversation

309
00:07:54,896 --> 00:07:55,526
view controller.

310
00:07:56,446 --> 00:07:58,566
Then, using either a custom view

311
00:07:58,566 --> 00:08:00,116
or a custom view controller,

312
00:07:58,566 --> 00:08:00,116
or a custom view controller,

313
00:08:00,116 --> 00:08:01,376
depending on what exactly you

314
00:08:01,376 --> 00:08:03,276
want to do with that view, you

315
00:08:03,276 --> 00:08:04,506
override the applicable method.

316
00:08:04,506 --> 00:08:06,006
Input accessory view, if you're

317
00:08:06,006 --> 00:08:06,676
using a view.

318
00:08:07,106 --> 00:08:08,536
Input accessory view controller,

319
00:08:08,686 --> 00:08:09,226
if you're using a view

320
00:08:09,226 --> 00:08:09,666
controller.

321
00:08:10,346 --> 00:08:12,926
So, the input accessory view

322
00:08:12,926 --> 00:08:15,416
that you add, is accounted for

323
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:16,886
in frame change notifications,

324
00:08:17,306 --> 00:08:18,886
and if the height of that input

325
00:08:18,886 --> 00:08:20,846
accessory view changes, it will

326
00:08:20,846 --> 00:08:22,086
send a frame change

327
00:08:22,086 --> 00:08:23,056
notification.

328
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:24,716
So, you can take care of that in

329
00:08:24,716 --> 00:08:27,566
the app that the keyboard is in.

330
00:08:27,956 --> 00:08:29,026
Let's talk about making a

331
00:08:29,026 --> 00:08:30,586
dynamic height changing input

332
00:08:30,586 --> 00:08:31,716
accessory view, because this is

333
00:08:31,716 --> 00:08:32,566
something that a lot of people

334
00:08:32,566 --> 00:08:33,905
want to be able to do.

335
00:08:34,446 --> 00:08:35,996
So, when you're doing this, this

336
00:08:35,996 --> 00:08:37,275
acts a lot like a self-sizing

337
00:08:37,275 --> 00:08:38,546
table view in that you want to

338
00:08:38,546 --> 00:08:39,635
take whatever view is going to

339
00:08:39,635 --> 00:08:41,456
be changing size, and use it to

340
00:08:41,456 --> 00:08:43,186
define the height of the view.

341
00:08:43,236 --> 00:08:44,526
And you can do this with more

342
00:08:44,526 --> 00:08:45,706
than one, but in this example,

343
00:08:45,706 --> 00:08:48,856
we'll use a UI text view to show

344
00:08:48,856 --> 00:08:50,186
how this might be done.

345
00:08:50,646 --> 00:08:52,226
If you pin -- you can pin it to

346
00:08:52,226 --> 00:08:54,246
the top and bottom of the

347
00:08:55,316 --> 00:08:57,226
content view with spacing if

348
00:08:57,226 --> 00:08:57,736
applicable.

349
00:08:58,296 --> 00:08:59,116
And if there are views in

350
00:08:59,116 --> 00:09:00,446
between it, that's fine as long

351
00:08:59,116 --> 00:09:00,446
between it, that's fine as long

352
00:09:00,446 --> 00:09:01,596
as the height is fully defined.

353
00:09:01,596 --> 00:09:02,616
Again, it's very similar to

354
00:09:02,616 --> 00:09:04,036
self-sizing table view cells.

355
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:07,716
At that point, you need to use

356
00:09:07,716 --> 00:09:09,216
or define the intrinsic content

357
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:10,826
size of your growing view, so

358
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:12,296
that the input accessory view

359
00:09:12,296 --> 00:09:14,776
knows how talk it needs to be.

360
00:09:14,996 --> 00:09:16,486
With a text view specifically,

361
00:09:16,876 --> 00:09:18,016
in order for it to have its own

362
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:19,466
intrinsic content size so that

363
00:09:19,466 --> 00:09:21,366
you don't have to define it, you

364
00:09:21,366 --> 00:09:22,696
need to tell its text container

365
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:23,976
to have its height track the

366
00:09:23,976 --> 00:09:24,546
text view.

367
00:09:25,316 --> 00:09:26,976
And you also need to disable

368
00:09:26,976 --> 00:09:27,586
scrolling.

369
00:09:28,146 --> 00:09:29,646
At that point, the text view

370
00:09:29,646 --> 00:09:30,516
defines its internal --

371
00:09:30,516 --> 00:09:32,966
intrinsic content size, based on

372
00:09:32,966 --> 00:09:34,486
the amount of text in the view.

373
00:09:34,486 --> 00:09:36,266
And you can get something like

374
00:09:37,556 --> 00:09:37,796
this.

375
00:09:37,796 --> 00:09:39,546
So, this is one of the few cases

376
00:09:39,546 --> 00:09:40,616
where you may need to actually

377
00:09:40,616 --> 00:09:42,396
override intrinsic content size

378
00:09:42,396 --> 00:09:43,686
in the input accessory view.

379
00:09:44,406 --> 00:09:45,826
And to do that, you don't want

380
00:09:45,826 --> 00:09:47,056
to spend, you know -- don't want

381
00:09:47,056 --> 00:09:48,026
to make it too complicated.

382
00:09:48,026 --> 00:09:50,036
It's actually not too bad.

383
00:09:50,036 --> 00:09:51,636
Grab the bounds as they come in.

384
00:09:51,636 --> 00:09:52,556
That's going to be your original

385
00:09:52,556 --> 00:09:53,526
bounds, and we'll make sure that

386
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:54,526
you have the correct width,

387
00:09:55,156 --> 00:09:56,086
which is already given to you by

388
00:09:56,086 --> 00:09:56,626
the system.

389
00:09:57,466 --> 00:09:58,886
In my case, I always like to

390
00:09:58,886 --> 00:10:00,086
make sure that the view has a

391
00:09:58,886 --> 00:10:00,086
make sure that the view has a

392
00:10:00,086 --> 00:10:02,276
minimum height, so I set it to

393
00:10:02,276 --> 00:10:03,376
minimum height first, just in

394
00:10:03,376 --> 00:10:05,126
case everything else -- all my

395
00:10:05,126 --> 00:10:06,686
other ifs are elses.

396
00:10:07,236 --> 00:10:09,676
And then, if my expanding view

397
00:10:09,676 --> 00:10:11,096
is the correct height, I use

398
00:10:11,096 --> 00:10:12,496
that plus some vertical padding

399
00:10:12,496 --> 00:10:14,126
I've previously defined to

400
00:10:14,126 --> 00:10:15,126
define the new height of the

401
00:10:15,126 --> 00:10:15,416
view.

402
00:10:16,216 --> 00:10:17,496
I also have a maximum height

403
00:10:17,496 --> 00:10:18,606
because there's only so much I

404
00:10:18,606 --> 00:10:19,886
actually should type to my cats

405
00:10:19,886 --> 00:10:20,376
at once.

406
00:10:20,886 --> 00:10:22,066
They don't have great attention

407
00:10:22,066 --> 00:10:22,526
spans.

408
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:26,126
So, at a point, it stops.

409
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:27,556
At that point, you simply return

410
00:10:27,866 --> 00:10:29,346
your new intrinsic content size,

411
00:10:29,576 --> 00:10:31,136
and your input accessory view

412
00:10:31,136 --> 00:10:31,576
will grow.

413
00:10:33,086 --> 00:10:35,646
Okay, so we have now talked

414
00:10:35,646 --> 00:10:36,786
about integrating the keyboard

415
00:10:36,786 --> 00:10:38,326
into your layout, and adding a

416
00:10:38,326 --> 00:10:39,836
dynamic input accessory view.

417
00:10:40,576 --> 00:10:41,976
Now, we have an app where I can

418
00:10:41,976 --> 00:10:44,076
talk to my cats, and I can say

419
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:45,226
more than a couple of words at

420
00:10:45,226 --> 00:10:46,216
once, which is nice.

421
00:10:46,866 --> 00:10:47,996
He doesn't need very many words.

422
00:10:47,996 --> 00:10:50,216
He's very specific in what he

423
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:50,836
needs from me.

424
00:10:51,436 --> 00:10:52,756
But there's more cool things

425
00:10:52,756 --> 00:10:54,546
that we can do with this app to

426
00:10:54,546 --> 00:10:56,216
make it a lot more interesting.

427
00:10:56,736 --> 00:10:57,696
So, I'm going to hand this over

428
00:10:57,696 --> 00:10:58,666
to Shuchen, and she's going to

429
00:10:58,666 --> 00:10:59,846
tell you all about how to make

430
00:10:59,846 --> 00:11:00,976
your app feel more magical.

431
00:10:59,846 --> 00:11:00,976
your app feel more magical.

432
00:11:01,516 --> 00:11:09,676
[ Applause ]

433
00:11:10,176 --> 00:11:12,276
&gt;&gt; Hello, everyone.

434
00:11:12,276 --> 00:11:14,676
So, in iOS, we provide a lot of

435
00:11:14,756 --> 00:11:17,146
sweet features so that you can

436
00:11:17,146 --> 00:11:18,776
improve our user text input

437
00:11:18,776 --> 00:11:19,356
experience.

438
00:11:19,926 --> 00:11:20,916
My name is Shuchen Li.

439
00:11:21,536 --> 00:11:23,256
I'm going to talk a few of them.

440
00:11:23,726 --> 00:11:26,056
So, I hope after my talk you can

441
00:11:26,326 --> 00:11:28,526
utilize these tricks and make

442
00:11:28,526 --> 00:11:29,666
your app feel magical.

443
00:11:30,226 --> 00:11:31,766
So, let's get started.

444
00:11:33,496 --> 00:11:35,106
So, first of all, let me ask a

445
00:11:35,106 --> 00:11:35,576
question.

446
00:11:35,636 --> 00:11:37,766
Who are multilingual people

447
00:11:37,766 --> 00:11:37,956
here?

448
00:11:38,566 --> 00:11:39,356
Oh, I see quite a few.

449
00:11:40,246 --> 00:11:43,666
So, am I. Do you face the

450
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:45,816
situation that you have to keep

451
00:11:45,816 --> 00:11:46,536
switch keyboard?

452
00:11:48,136 --> 00:11:49,276
Oh, I see one there.

453
00:11:49,276 --> 00:11:50,786
Oh, I see a few of you there.

454
00:11:51,656 --> 00:11:53,696
Good. I suffer that problem too.

455
00:11:53,696 --> 00:11:56,446
And I have to talk to my boss

456
00:11:56,566 --> 00:11:57,236
with one keyboard.

457
00:11:57,666 --> 00:11:58,846
I talk to my mom with another

458
00:11:58,846 --> 00:11:59,256
keyboard.

459
00:11:59,336 --> 00:12:00,776
I have to keep switch between

460
00:11:59,336 --> 00:12:00,776
I have to keep switch between

461
00:12:00,776 --> 00:12:00,996
these.

462
00:12:01,636 --> 00:12:04,226
What if your app just know what

463
00:12:04,226 --> 00:12:04,996
keyboard you use?

464
00:12:05,706 --> 00:12:07,176
What if when keyboard brings up,

465
00:12:07,356 --> 00:12:08,706
it's just the right keyboard for

466
00:12:09,236 --> 00:12:09,306
you?

467
00:12:10,036 --> 00:12:12,546
Actually, you may know this.

468
00:12:12,976 --> 00:12:14,626
In our Message app, it does that

469
00:12:14,626 --> 00:12:14,866
for you.

470
00:12:14,866 --> 00:12:17,786
I talk to John with English

471
00:12:17,786 --> 00:12:18,156
keyboard.

472
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:21,346
I talk to my [inaudible] with

473
00:12:21,346 --> 00:12:22,076
Chinese keyboard.

474
00:12:23,066 --> 00:12:24,216
And Magic knows what keyboard

475
00:12:24,216 --> 00:12:24,646
I'm using.

476
00:12:25,616 --> 00:12:27,816
How does that work?

477
00:12:28,026 --> 00:12:32,676
In iOS, we can associate a

478
00:12:32,676 --> 00:12:34,626
unique identifier called Text

479
00:12:34,626 --> 00:12:37,086
Input Context Identifier, with

480
00:12:37,086 --> 00:12:38,216
your text view.

481
00:12:38,406 --> 00:12:40,106
Actually, we can associate that

482
00:12:40,316 --> 00:12:41,846
with all your UI Responder.

483
00:12:42,196 --> 00:12:43,816
That is, you can also do that

484
00:12:43,816 --> 00:12:47,216
with your view controllers.

485
00:12:48,736 --> 00:12:50,576
So, when we see you have a

486
00:12:50,576 --> 00:12:52,906
unique identifier set up,

487
00:12:53,146 --> 00:12:54,816
whether you're a responder, we

488
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:56,116
will associate that

489
00:12:56,116 --> 00:12:58,076
automatically with the user

490
00:12:58,076 --> 00:13:00,406
selected keyboard, and then save

491
00:12:58,076 --> 00:13:00,406
selected keyboard, and then save

492
00:13:00,406 --> 00:13:01,926
that into user default.

493
00:13:02,466 --> 00:13:04,306
Next time, when you are a

494
00:13:04,306 --> 00:13:05,606
responder, becomes a first

495
00:13:05,606 --> 00:13:07,566
responder, the keyboard will be

496
00:13:07,566 --> 00:13:08,606
retrieved automatically.

497
00:13:09,366 --> 00:13:10,966
Sounds complicated.

498
00:13:11,736 --> 00:13:13,336
The only thing you need to worry

499
00:13:13,336 --> 00:13:15,046
about is to find a good unique

500
00:13:15,046 --> 00:13:15,596
identifier.

501
00:13:16,456 --> 00:13:17,196
What are good unique

502
00:13:17,196 --> 00:13:17,846
identifiers?

503
00:13:18,116 --> 00:13:21,076
For example, your user ID, your

504
00:13:21,076 --> 00:13:23,116
conversation ID, the group IDs,

505
00:13:23,716 --> 00:13:28,776
these are all good examples.

506
00:13:28,826 --> 00:13:31,726
So, you may ask, "Where should I

507
00:13:31,826 --> 00:13:33,626
put this unique identifier?

508
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:35,476
You mentioned, yes, I can define

509
00:13:35,476 --> 00:13:36,606
it in all the UI responder.

510
00:13:36,606 --> 00:13:37,926
Do I define it everywhere?"

511
00:13:37,926 --> 00:13:38,636
Of course not.

512
00:13:39,426 --> 00:13:40,626
So, let's see how we put it.

513
00:13:41,406 --> 00:13:43,976
Let's recall our CatChat app.

514
00:13:44,196 --> 00:13:45,516
When we bring out the keyboard,

515
00:13:46,236 --> 00:13:48,036
the text view becomes the first

516
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:48,486
responder.

517
00:13:49,176 --> 00:13:50,546
And then what's next, in the

518
00:13:50,546 --> 00:13:52,576
responder chain, is our

519
00:13:52,576 --> 00:13:53,926
conversation view controller.

520
00:13:54,726 --> 00:13:56,086
And then, it's navigation

521
00:13:56,086 --> 00:13:56,486
controller.

522
00:13:57,036 --> 00:14:02,806
And then, in iOS, when we look

523
00:13:57,036 --> 00:14:02,806
And then, in iOS, when we look

524
00:14:02,806 --> 00:14:05,106
for the unique identifier for

525
00:14:05,106 --> 00:14:07,186
your responder, we will search

526
00:14:07,186 --> 00:14:08,956
and look up the responder chain

527
00:14:08,956 --> 00:14:10,546
to look for the first one.

528
00:14:10,946 --> 00:14:13,466
So, in our app, we handle all

529
00:14:13,466 --> 00:14:14,546
our conversation in our

530
00:14:14,546 --> 00:14:15,606
conversation view controller.

531
00:14:16,186 --> 00:14:16,896
So, we put it there.

532
00:14:17,816 --> 00:14:19,966
In such way, you don't have to

533
00:14:20,146 --> 00:14:22,206
find a way you pass down your

534
00:14:22,206 --> 00:14:24,646
unique identifier to your

535
00:14:24,646 --> 00:14:25,956
[inaudible] or other places that

536
00:14:25,956 --> 00:14:26,636
it want to pass in.

537
00:14:27,136 --> 00:14:28,296
So, you just put in where you

538
00:14:28,296 --> 00:14:29,526
handle all your conversations.

539
00:14:30,646 --> 00:14:31,666
Let's see how we transfer all

540
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:32,376
these into code.

541
00:14:32,886 --> 00:14:35,916
In our conversation view

542
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:37,856
controller, we override the

543
00:14:37,856 --> 00:14:39,446
[inaudible] for Text Input

544
00:14:39,446 --> 00:14:40,456
Context Identifier.

545
00:14:41,016 --> 00:14:41,966
You can see this method.

546
00:14:41,966 --> 00:14:42,586
It's very simple.

547
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:44,116
It's just return a unique

548
00:14:44,116 --> 00:14:44,676
identifier.

549
00:14:45,386 --> 00:14:48,076
In our case, we return our

550
00:14:48,076 --> 00:14:49,606
recipient's ID.

551
00:14:51,016 --> 00:14:53,716
Now, Kasia is going to show you

552
00:14:53,716 --> 00:14:55,786
a demo to see how we give our

553
00:14:55,886 --> 00:14:56,796
app a memory.

554
00:14:57,366 --> 00:14:57,706
Kasia?

556

557
00:15:03,806 --> 00:15:04,686
&gt;&gt; You may not remember me.

558
00:15:04,836 --> 00:15:05,646
It's been a while since I've

559
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:06,196
seen you all.

560
00:15:06,726 --> 00:15:09,246
But Kasia's still on keyboards.

561
00:15:09,726 --> 00:15:13,896
Okay, so first -- here we have

562
00:15:13,896 --> 00:15:15,006
our CatChat app that we've been

563
00:15:15,006 --> 00:15:15,746
looking at today.

564
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,006
And I've got a couple of pets

565
00:15:18,006 --> 00:15:19,116
that speak different languages.

566
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:20,786
I have my Misiu here.

567
00:15:21,236 --> 00:15:22,316
He speaks Polish.

568
00:15:22,316 --> 00:15:23,186
And actually, I learned as a

569
00:15:23,186 --> 00:15:24,336
child that all cats speak

570
00:15:24,336 --> 00:15:24,796
Polish.

571
00:15:24,796 --> 00:15:25,876
So, it's important to speak

572
00:15:25,876 --> 00:15:26,736
Polish to all of them.

573
00:15:27,556 --> 00:15:29,256
But, my default keyboard as an

574
00:15:29,256 --> 00:15:30,666
English speaker is English.

575
00:15:31,196 --> 00:15:32,116
So, if I go ahead and change it

576
00:15:32,116 --> 00:15:34,486
to Polish, and say "Hello,"

577
00:15:35,186 --> 00:15:36,306
let's see.

578
00:15:36,536 --> 00:15:42,666
And see, you know, how he's

579
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:43,106
doing today.

580
00:15:43,106 --> 00:15:44,876
This is me saying, "Hey, how are

581
00:15:44,876 --> 00:15:45,256
you doing?"

582
00:15:45,566 --> 00:15:46,796
And he wants food.

583
00:15:47,516 --> 00:15:48,466
This is so surprising.

584
00:15:49,476 --> 00:15:51,226
Well, let's check in on

585
00:15:51,486 --> 00:15:53,106
Shuchen's dog, Jiwang.

586
00:15:54,546 --> 00:15:56,166
And Jiwang would like to go out

587
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:57,496
for a walk, but I don't

588
00:15:57,496 --> 00:15:58,366
currently have time.

589
00:15:58,816 --> 00:16:01,056
However, he speaks Chinese, so

590
00:15:58,816 --> 00:16:01,056
However, he speaks Chinese, so

591
00:16:01,056 --> 00:16:01,966
I'm going to switch keyboards

592
00:16:01,966 --> 00:16:03,206
again to the Chinese pinyin

593
00:16:03,206 --> 00:16:05,426
keyboard, and say, "I don't have

594
00:16:05,426 --> 00:16:05,976
time right now.

595
00:16:06,676 --> 00:16:07,346
Please be patient."

596
00:16:08,326 --> 00:16:10,146
And dogs are a little bit

597
00:16:10,506 --> 00:16:11,946
friendlier sometimes with their

598
00:16:11,946 --> 00:16:12,826
responses than cats.

599
00:16:13,236 --> 00:16:14,916
So, now, this is the first time

600
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:16,086
I've used this to talk to both

601
00:16:16,086 --> 00:16:16,426
of them.

602
00:16:16,926 --> 00:16:18,106
So, if I go back into Misiu's

603
00:16:18,106 --> 00:16:19,686
conversation, the Polish

604
00:16:19,686 --> 00:16:20,586
keyboard is still there.

605
00:16:20,966 --> 00:16:23,156
And if I go back here, I still

606
00:16:23,156 --> 00:16:24,996
have the Chinese keyboard.

607
00:16:25,326 --> 00:16:26,076
So, I don't have to keep

608
00:16:26,136 --> 00:16:27,726
switching keyboards, depending

609
00:16:27,726 --> 00:16:28,886
on the conversation I'm in.

610
00:16:29,306 --> 00:16:30,516
And all that needed to happen

611
00:16:30,516 --> 00:16:32,356
for that to happen, was to set

612
00:16:32,566 --> 00:16:35,526
that text input context

613
00:16:35,526 --> 00:16:37,316
identifier, as Shuchen showed

614
00:16:37,316 --> 00:16:39,336
you, with the unique ID of each

615
00:16:39,336 --> 00:16:40,116
individual chat.

616
00:16:40,516 --> 00:16:42,546
If I change languages now, my

617
00:16:42,546 --> 00:16:43,416
app doesn't need to know what

618
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:44,156
language I'm in.

619
00:16:44,476 --> 00:16:45,426
It just needs to know that it's

620
00:16:45,426 --> 00:16:47,166
in a specific conversation and

621
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:49,146
we will take care of setting the

622
00:16:49,146 --> 00:16:50,226
proper keyboard for you.

623
00:16:50,586 --> 00:16:50,653
So.

624
00:16:51,016 --> 00:16:53,000
[ Applause ]

625
00:16:59,426 --> 00:17:02,336
Okay, back to Shuchen.

626
00:16:59,426 --> 00:17:02,336
Okay, back to Shuchen.

627
00:17:03,776 --> 00:17:05,185
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Kasia.

628
00:17:06,116 --> 00:17:07,205
A quite neat feature, right?

629
00:17:07,376 --> 00:17:08,915
It'll save quite a bit of wear

630
00:17:08,915 --> 00:17:09,736
and tear on your [inaudible] I

631
00:17:09,736 --> 00:17:10,205
believe.

632
00:17:10,205 --> 00:17:14,046
So, in this whole process, you

633
00:17:14,046 --> 00:17:16,136
may notice, you don't really

634
00:17:16,136 --> 00:17:17,736
need to care what keyboard the

635
00:17:17,736 --> 00:17:18,546
user selected.

636
00:17:18,945 --> 00:17:19,675
You don't need to know.

637
00:17:20,116 --> 00:17:21,266
The only thing you need to worry

638
00:17:21,266 --> 00:17:23,116
about is the unique identifier

639
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:24,616
that was set up.

640
00:17:24,616 --> 00:17:26,516
Now you may ask, what if you

641
00:17:26,516 --> 00:17:28,316
want to know what's the language

642
00:17:28,386 --> 00:17:29,216
the user used?

643
00:17:30,106 --> 00:17:31,836
What if you want to develop a

644
00:17:31,836 --> 00:17:33,986
specific feature for a certain

645
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:34,466
language?

646
00:17:35,536 --> 00:17:37,616
Now you may want to look up UI

647
00:17:37,616 --> 00:17:38,496
text input mode.

648
00:17:39,136 --> 00:17:40,896
In UI text input mode, you can

649
00:17:40,896 --> 00:17:42,726
easily access the primary

650
00:17:42,726 --> 00:17:43,756
language for the user.

651
00:17:44,956 --> 00:17:47,156
In such way, you can for

652
00:17:47,156 --> 00:17:48,516
example, develop your own spell

653
00:17:48,516 --> 00:17:52,456
checker for your own language or

654
00:17:52,456 --> 00:17:54,136
you can develop other specific

655
00:17:54,136 --> 00:17:55,236
feature for the specific

656
00:17:55,236 --> 00:17:56,846
language that you want that

657
00:17:56,846 --> 00:17:57,886
probably [inaudible] support

658
00:17:57,886 --> 00:17:59,536
where -- we will support maybe

659
00:17:59,706 --> 00:18:01,316
in future.

660
00:17:59,706 --> 00:18:01,316
in future.

661
00:18:02,146 --> 00:18:05,936
Now, next, we've been working

662
00:18:05,936 --> 00:18:08,916
really hard on how to accurately

663
00:18:09,376 --> 00:18:10,726
and quickly input text.

664
00:18:11,646 --> 00:18:13,286
We made it further through a

665
00:18:13,286 --> 00:18:14,786
context scroll predictions.

666
00:18:16,516 --> 00:18:19,516
Also, we take user personalized

667
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:21,506
information into account.

668
00:18:23,016 --> 00:18:25,806
Back in iOS 4, we introduced

669
00:18:26,046 --> 00:18:26,626
keyboard types.

670
00:18:27,566 --> 00:18:29,626
There's different keyboard types

671
00:18:29,626 --> 00:18:31,786
like email keyboards, URL

672
00:18:31,786 --> 00:18:32,216
keyboards.

673
00:18:32,216 --> 00:18:33,436
If you're typing an email

674
00:18:33,646 --> 00:18:36,116
address, the @ and the .com keys

675
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:38,186
are there for easy typing.

676
00:18:39,536 --> 00:18:42,586
Last year, we introduced UI text

677
00:18:43,306 --> 00:18:43,956
content type.

678
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:48,136
UI text content type, it's a tag

679
00:18:48,336 --> 00:18:49,706
that you can set to your text

680
00:18:49,706 --> 00:18:49,926
view.

681
00:18:50,516 --> 00:18:55,056
It will provide all the context

682
00:18:55,056 --> 00:18:58,906
predictions through the tags.

683
00:18:58,906 --> 00:19:02,166
Let's see an example.

684
00:18:58,906 --> 00:19:02,166
Let's see an example.

685
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:04,986
So, now, John wants to add his

686
00:19:04,986 --> 00:19:07,606
cat, Penny, into our CatChat

687
00:19:07,606 --> 00:19:07,806
app.

688
00:19:08,246 --> 00:19:09,906
This is John Appleseed's cat.

689
00:19:10,636 --> 00:19:12,996
From the video, you can see

690
00:19:13,056 --> 00:19:14,736
actually John didn't even type

691
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:15,766
on any of the letter keys.

692
00:19:16,456 --> 00:19:18,426
He was just typing on the Quick

693
00:19:18,426 --> 00:19:18,816
Type bar.

694
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:21,986
All the informations are input.

695
00:19:23,316 --> 00:19:24,926
Now, John wants to type the

696
00:19:24,926 --> 00:19:26,056
address for the cat.

697
00:19:27,026 --> 00:19:28,556
So, that's John Appleseed's cat.

698
00:19:28,806 --> 00:19:30,416
So, it lives in -- must be

699
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:31,686
living in an Apple store.

700
00:19:32,486 --> 00:19:33,046
Which one?

701
00:19:33,776 --> 00:19:35,056
The one is Los Gatos.

702
00:19:41,696 --> 00:19:42,926
For someone if we don't know,

703
00:19:42,926 --> 00:19:44,256
Los Gatos means "cat" in

704
00:19:44,256 --> 00:19:44,726
Spanish.

705
00:19:46,436 --> 00:19:48,006
So, we can see, John went to the

706
00:19:49,136 --> 00:19:50,806
map and browsed the Apple store

707
00:19:52,036 --> 00:19:53,246
and see what's the address.

708
00:19:54,056 --> 00:19:55,216
And then come back to our

709
00:19:55,216 --> 00:19:55,856
CatChat app.

710
00:19:57,176 --> 00:19:59,186
And then you will see, ta-da,

711
00:19:59,646 --> 00:20:00,356
the address are there,

712
00:19:59,646 --> 00:20:00,356
the address are there,

713
00:20:01,206 --> 00:20:01,786
magically.

714
00:20:01,786 --> 00:20:03,836
And by typing on the Quick Type

715
00:20:03,836 --> 00:20:06,866
bar, you can -- thank you.

716
00:20:07,796 --> 00:20:08,806
If I type on the Quick Type bar,

717
00:20:09,226 --> 00:20:11,196
you can directly input the whole

718
00:20:11,336 --> 00:20:11,816
address.

719
00:20:12,626 --> 00:20:15,856
If you look closely, you can see

720
00:20:16,226 --> 00:20:16,836
its source.

721
00:20:17,276 --> 00:20:18,716
It's from Map, in our case.

722
00:20:21,276 --> 00:20:24,886
So, in iOS, we've been pulling

723
00:20:24,986 --> 00:20:27,226
all user information and user

724
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,796
activities as a whole, to come

725
00:20:29,796 --> 00:20:32,036
with the data source, to improve

726
00:20:32,036 --> 00:20:33,286
user's experience.

727
00:20:34,436 --> 00:20:36,436
For example, our keyboard

728
00:20:36,436 --> 00:20:38,966
personalization also can extract

729
00:20:38,966 --> 00:20:41,106
names to form keyboard

730
00:20:41,106 --> 00:20:42,766
personalization lexicon.

731
00:20:44,956 --> 00:20:47,966
Also, one more thing I want to

732
00:20:47,966 --> 00:20:48,446
mention.

733
00:20:48,996 --> 00:20:52,046
In this whole process, your app

734
00:20:52,046 --> 00:20:54,086
is not only a passive receiver.

735
00:20:54,986 --> 00:20:57,146
Your app can be a contributor.

736
00:20:58,326 --> 00:20:59,826
Your app can contribute your

737
00:20:59,826 --> 00:21:02,426
app's activity through NS User

738
00:20:59,826 --> 00:21:02,426
app's activity through NS User

739
00:21:02,426 --> 00:21:04,366
Activity APIs.

740
00:21:05,176 --> 00:21:08,316
So, for example, if your browse

741
00:21:08,396 --> 00:21:09,406
your favorite restaurant in

742
00:21:09,406 --> 00:21:12,946
Yelp, the address can be

743
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:14,626
displayed on the Quick Type bar,

744
00:21:14,906 --> 00:21:16,746
if you set the tag properly.

745
00:21:17,286 --> 00:21:19,316
So, sounds interested?

746
00:21:20,366 --> 00:21:22,606
If you want to learn more, don't

747
00:21:22,606 --> 00:21:24,686
forget to look at the session

748
00:21:24,776 --> 00:21:27,066
from last year called "Increase

749
00:21:27,066 --> 00:21:29,516
Usage of Your App Through

750
00:21:29,796 --> 00:21:31,836
Proactive Suggestion."

751
00:21:33,586 --> 00:21:35,856
So, this year, we made it

752
00:21:36,456 --> 00:21:36,596
further.

753
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:38,726
We add some new tags for user

754
00:21:38,726 --> 00:21:39,896
name and password.

755
00:21:40,366 --> 00:21:43,726
When you label your log-in field

756
00:21:43,726 --> 00:21:45,696
properly, we will automatically

757
00:21:45,696 --> 00:21:48,306
suggest user name and password

758
00:21:48,576 --> 00:21:49,956
for your app.

759
00:21:49,956 --> 00:21:52,136
And also, fill that for you.

760
00:21:54,536 --> 00:21:56,186
The only thing you need to do,

761
00:21:56,396 --> 00:21:58,286
if you set your tags properly,

762
00:21:58,786 --> 00:22:01,366
this is a one line API super

763
00:21:58,786 --> 00:22:01,366
this is a one line API super

764
00:22:01,366 --> 00:22:03,546
simple, and it will guarantee

765
00:22:03,546 --> 00:22:05,376
that some of the Quick Type

766
00:22:05,376 --> 00:22:06,596
suggestion will display.

767
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:10,186
However, this is not the full

768
00:22:10,186 --> 00:22:10,496
story.

00:22:17,746 --> 00:22:18,916
you may have a website to

00:22:18,916 --> 00:22:21,186
associate with your app, you'd

777
00:22:24,916 --> 00:22:29,446
So, next up, we talk about some

778
00:22:29,446 --> 00:22:30,206
new smartness.

779
00:22:30,256 --> 00:22:33,856
This year, we introduced some

780
00:22:33,856 --> 00:22:37,996
smartness into our text view.

781
00:22:38,236 --> 00:22:40,126
First one is Smart Quote.

782
00:22:41,176 --> 00:22:43,426
Here are typewriter quotes.

783
00:22:44,516 --> 00:22:47,146
They are straight and some

784
00:22:48,406 --> 00:22:49,846
people don't like it.

785
00:22:49,846 --> 00:22:51,776
I don't like it.

786
00:22:53,436 --> 00:22:55,186
These are typographic quotes.

787
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:56,136
I like it.

788
00:22:56,206 --> 00:22:57,736
They are curly.

789
00:22:58,326 --> 00:22:59,136
They're more legible.

790
00:22:59,866 --> 00:23:01,096
And actually, they're more

791
00:22:59,866 --> 00:23:01,096
And actually, they're more

792
00:23:01,096 --> 00:23:02,746
grammatically correct in the

793
00:23:02,746 --> 00:23:03,556
language perspective.

794
00:23:04,076 --> 00:23:06,246
And this year, iOS will

795
00:23:06,386 --> 00:23:09,386
automatically convert your

796
00:23:09,386 --> 00:23:11,456
typewriter quote into

797
00:23:11,766 --> 00:23:12,976
typographic quote.

[ Applause ]

799
00:23:20,486 --> 00:23:21,846
What's next?

800
00:23:22,396 --> 00:23:23,936
When you type on the middle bar

801
00:23:23,936 --> 00:23:26,956
line, sometimes you just think

802
00:23:26,956 --> 00:23:28,876
about, "Okay, a hyphen, an end

803
00:23:28,876 --> 00:23:30,286
dash, and add dash," how to do

804
00:23:30,286 --> 00:23:30,466
that.

805
00:23:31,266 --> 00:23:33,336
From this year, we can input a

806
00:23:33,336 --> 00:23:34,386
hyphen with one dash.

807
00:23:35,026 --> 00:23:36,476
We will automatically convert

808
00:23:36,476 --> 00:23:38,246
two dashes into an end dash.

809
00:23:39,566 --> 00:23:41,336
And then, add dash with three

810
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:41,976
dashes of course.

811
00:23:42,516 --> 00:23:46,606
[ Applause ]

812
00:23:47,106 --> 00:23:49,916
Also, we introduce Smart

813
00:23:49,916 --> 00:23:51,036
Insertion and Smart Deletion.

814
00:23:51,576 --> 00:23:53,886
If you work with tags before,

815
00:23:54,826 --> 00:23:57,036
you have to insert and delete a

816
00:23:57,036 --> 00:23:59,206
paragraph or a phrase, you know

817
00:23:59,206 --> 00:23:59,946
what I'm talking about.

818
00:24:00,366 --> 00:24:01,846
And not even mention the trouble

819
00:24:01,846 --> 00:24:02,826
caused by punctuation.

820
00:24:03,206 --> 00:24:06,196
So, for example, in our example,

821
00:24:06,536 --> 00:24:08,136
Vivian wants to bring Jiwang

822
00:24:08,136 --> 00:24:10,946
also to the party, but then

823
00:24:11,066 --> 00:24:12,206
Jiwang was sick.

824
00:24:12,536 --> 00:24:14,836
So, we have to remove him.

825
00:24:15,316 --> 00:24:18,006
Now, in this whole process, you

826
00:24:18,046 --> 00:24:19,636
have to deal with a space.

827
00:24:19,856 --> 00:24:20,506
That's the trouble.

00:24:21,346 --> 00:24:22,086
Troublemaker.

829
00:24:23,596 --> 00:24:26,446
So, from today, we will take

830
00:24:26,446 --> 00:24:27,546
care of all of that for you.

831
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:29,246
With Smart Insertion and

832
00:24:29,246 --> 00:24:30,866
Deletion, we'll take care of all

833
00:24:30,866 --> 00:24:32,826
the leading and trailing spaces

834
00:24:32,826 --> 00:24:33,660
for you.

835

[ Applause ]

836
00:24:38,706 --> 00:24:40,836
Also, I want to mention, all the

837
00:24:40,886 --> 00:24:41,976
smartness that we introduced

838
00:24:41,976 --> 00:24:43,106
that I have talked about today,

839
00:24:43,326 --> 00:24:44,426
they are all by default.

840
00:24:45,496 --> 00:24:47,786
But I want you note, for these

841
00:24:47,786 --> 00:24:50,836
smart text input traits, they

842
00:24:51,216 --> 00:24:52,426
have three values.

843
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:54,316
They have yes, no, and the

844
00:24:54,316 --> 00:24:54,986
default value.

845
00:24:55,866 --> 00:24:57,246
We set the default value for

846
00:24:57,246 --> 00:24:58,916
default for all of you.

847
00:25:00,236 --> 00:25:01,936
We will automatically do the

848
00:25:01,936 --> 00:25:02,866
right thing for you.

849
00:25:03,156 --> 00:25:07,256
For example, if you have a text

850
00:25:07,336 --> 00:25:09,086
field, you set the Secured Text

851
00:25:09,086 --> 00:25:10,066
Entry to Yes.

852
00:25:10,736 --> 00:25:12,076
Probably it's the password

853
00:25:12,076 --> 00:25:12,386
field.

854
00:25:12,626 --> 00:25:14,956
In that case, if you set your

855
00:25:14,956 --> 00:25:17,756
smart traits to default, we will

856
00:25:17,756 --> 00:25:20,326
automatically disable the smart

857
00:25:20,326 --> 00:25:21,346
quote conversion for you,

858
00:25:21,456 --> 00:25:22,876
because we think probably that's

859
00:25:22,876 --> 00:25:23,906
the user password.

860
00:25:24,046 --> 00:25:26,046
We don't want to switch user

861
00:25:26,096 --> 00:25:27,976
typing for a password field.

862
00:25:29,046 --> 00:25:31,796
If you recall, actually we can

863
00:25:31,796 --> 00:25:33,546
config auto correction types.

864
00:25:33,816 --> 00:25:34,776
We can config auto

865
00:25:34,776 --> 00:25:35,796
capitalization types.

866
00:25:36,286 --> 00:25:39,006
There are a lot of sweet traits

867
00:25:39,006 --> 00:25:40,106
that we have in Text Input

868
00:25:40,106 --> 00:25:40,466
traits.

869
00:25:41,436 --> 00:25:43,276
All of them have this default

870
00:25:43,276 --> 00:25:43,566
value.

871
00:25:44,526 --> 00:25:46,076
What I want to emphasize here

872
00:25:46,076 --> 00:25:48,616
is, before you play with any of

873
00:25:48,616 --> 00:25:51,466
these traits, always understand

874
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:53,036
what your tags is going to be.

875
00:25:54,136 --> 00:25:56,256
Always understand what the tags

876
00:25:56,556 --> 00:25:57,786
you're expecting the user to

877
00:25:57,786 --> 00:25:58,166
type.

878
00:25:58,806 --> 00:26:00,876
So, let me ask another question.

879
00:25:58,806 --> 00:26:00,876
So, let me ask another question.

880
00:26:00,876 --> 00:26:04,096
Who flew to San Jose for WWDC?

881
00:26:04,096 --> 00:26:05,306
Well, welcome.

882
00:26:06,456 --> 00:26:10,166
So, am I. Kidding this time.

883
00:26:10,376 --> 00:26:12,986
If you have a text entry, only

884
00:26:12,986 --> 00:26:17,366
take flight code as an input, in

885
00:26:17,366 --> 00:26:18,776
such case, probably you want to

886
00:26:18,946 --> 00:26:21,916
disable auto correction type and

887
00:26:21,916 --> 00:26:24,706
auto capitalization type setting

888
00:26:24,706 --> 00:26:25,096
to No.

889
00:26:25,566 --> 00:26:27,416
Right? Because that makes sense.

890
00:26:28,156 --> 00:26:29,806
So, you always want to fully

891
00:26:29,806 --> 00:26:34,396
understand your text before set

892
00:26:34,396 --> 00:26:35,126
all these traits.

893
00:26:35,126 --> 00:26:36,796
Not just, okay, type on the tab

894
00:26:36,796 --> 00:26:38,086
and just say, "Okay, yes," or

895
00:26:38,086 --> 00:26:39,496
"No," just by thing.

896
00:26:39,926 --> 00:26:41,746
Always fully understand it.

897
00:26:43,556 --> 00:26:44,636
This is my point.

898
00:26:45,056 --> 00:26:50,336
Next, while work with text, you

899
00:26:50,336 --> 00:26:52,116
can now ignore marked texts.

900
00:26:53,006 --> 00:26:54,696
Two big names, Chinese and

901
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:55,016
Japanese.

902
00:26:55,136 --> 00:26:57,316
They all use marked texts.

903
00:26:57,316 --> 00:26:58,676
So, marked text language call

904
00:26:58,676 --> 00:27:00,526
word, the marked text into final

905
00:26:58,676 --> 00:27:00,526
word, the marked text into final

906
00:27:00,526 --> 00:27:01,996
text by select candidates.

907
00:27:02,546 --> 00:27:05,796
In iOS, actually you can easily

908
00:27:05,796 --> 00:27:07,826
access marked text from UI Text

909
00:27:07,826 --> 00:27:08,216
Input.

910
00:27:08,906 --> 00:27:10,876
You can directly use the marked

911
00:27:11,676 --> 00:27:11,886
text.

912
00:27:12,536 --> 00:27:14,466
We have an example in our system

913
00:27:14,896 --> 00:27:15,786
is the Spotlight.

914
00:27:16,806 --> 00:27:20,076
In Spotlight, when user type in

915
00:27:20,076 --> 00:27:22,506
Chinese for example, before

916
00:27:22,506 --> 00:27:24,036
users select the candidate,

917
00:27:25,406 --> 00:27:27,096
Spotlight engine already start

918
00:27:27,096 --> 00:27:28,566
to show you all the results.

919
00:27:29,216 --> 00:27:30,756
You can also do that in your app

920
00:27:31,156 --> 00:27:33,296
through the marked text by

921
00:27:33,296 --> 00:27:34,546
retrieving it from UI Text

922
00:27:34,546 --> 00:27:34,896
Input.

923
00:27:36,106 --> 00:27:37,576
In such way, user won't be

924
00:27:37,576 --> 00:27:39,136
interrupted by selecting

925
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:39,616
candidate.

926
00:27:39,856 --> 00:27:41,506
The user can spend more time to

927
00:27:41,506 --> 00:27:43,466
enjoy your app.

928
00:27:43,866 --> 00:27:46,156
I won't dive into too much about

929
00:27:46,156 --> 00:27:48,106
internationalization stuff, but

930
00:27:48,106 --> 00:27:49,956

00:27:58,726 --> 00:28:00,156
I think everyone use hardware

00:28:02,016 --> 00:28:03,736
love the keyboard shortcuts,

939
00:28:03,876 --> 00:28:05,326
like Command C, Command V,

940
00:28:05,696 --> 00:28:06,616
probably your favorite is

941
00:28:06,616 --> 00:28:07,256
Command Z.

942
00:28:07,416 --> 00:28:11,306
We brought that to iOS with

943
00:28:11,306 --> 00:28:11,876
Smart Keyboard.

944
00:28:12,396 --> 00:28:17,206
So, in iOS, you can define your

945
00:28:17,206 --> 00:28:21,066
own shortcut for your user if I

946
00:28:21,066 --> 00:28:23,646
have iPad app.

947
00:28:23,906 --> 00:28:25,286
So, let's see, how we do that.

948
00:28:25,286 --> 00:28:27,676
Let's dive right into the code.

949
00:28:28,096 --> 00:28:29,256
It's very straightforward and

950
00:28:29,256 --> 00:28:29,666
easy.

951
00:28:30,796 --> 00:28:32,876
Again, in UI Responder, you can

952
00:28:32,876 --> 00:28:34,086
override the key commands.

953
00:28:34,646 --> 00:28:38,116
Key commands return an array of

954
00:28:38,116 --> 00:28:38,636
key commands.

955
00:28:38,636 --> 00:28:39,966
That means you can define a

956
00:28:40,096 --> 00:28:42,746
couple shortcuts for your app at

957
00:28:42,746 --> 00:28:43,976
the same time.

958
00:28:44,736 --> 00:28:46,736
To define a key command is very

959
00:28:46,736 --> 00:28:47,576
straightforward.

960
00:28:48,506 --> 00:28:49,386
You give it inputs.

961
00:28:50,156 --> 00:28:51,156
You give a modifier.

962
00:28:52,166 --> 00:28:53,326
You put your selector there.

963
00:28:54,036 --> 00:28:55,236
And then also give it a name.

964
00:28:56,006 --> 00:28:57,266
Also, don't forget to localize

965
00:28:57,266 --> 00:28:58,316
your name.

966
00:28:59,276 --> 00:29:01,736
This is our second shortcut.

967
00:28:59,276 --> 00:29:01,736
This is our second shortcut.

968
00:29:02,286 --> 00:29:06,946
Now, press on the Command key,

969
00:29:07,236 --> 00:29:10,316
it will display the keyboard

970
00:29:10,316 --> 00:29:12,066
shortcut for you and then you

971
00:29:12,066 --> 00:29:14,196
can see in our CatChat app, we

972
00:29:14,196 --> 00:29:16,516
have Command Up and Command Down

973
00:29:16,516 --> 00:29:18,886
to switch between the

974
00:29:20,716 --> 00:29:21,066
conversations.

975
00:29:21,066 --> 00:29:21,826
So, let's recap.

976
00:29:22,386 --> 00:29:23,216
I've talked about the

977
00:29:23,216 --> 00:29:24,716
multilingual problem to how to

978
00:29:24,716 --> 00:29:25,836
give your app a memory.

979
00:29:26,346 --> 00:29:29,336
I've talked about how to take

980
00:29:29,606 --> 00:29:31,356
most advantages out of the

981
00:29:31,356 --> 00:29:33,766
context for predictions by

982
00:29:33,766 --> 00:29:35,376
giving your text field a tag

983
00:29:35,906 --> 00:29:36,976
through text content type.

984
00:29:37,836 --> 00:29:39,556
I talked about the new smartness

985
00:29:40,156 --> 00:29:41,506
for text input fields.

986
00:29:42,426 --> 00:29:44,156
I also talked about the mark

987
00:29:44,486 --> 00:29:45,026
text.

988
00:29:45,846 --> 00:29:47,836
Last but not least, there's

989
00:29:47,836 --> 00:29:48,996
keyboard shortcuts you'll want

990
00:29:48,996 --> 00:29:49,446
to try out.

991
00:29:50,656 --> 00:29:51,276
Try them all.

992
00:29:51,896 --> 00:29:55,506
Next, James is going to talk

993
00:29:55,506 --> 00:29:57,856
about how to create a custom

994
00:29:57,926 --> 00:29:58,576
input views.

995
00:29:58,996 --> 00:29:59,306
James?

996
00:30:00,516 --> 00:30:05,566
[ Applause ]

997
00:30:06,066 --> 00:30:06,806
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Shuchen.

998
00:30:07,266 --> 00:30:08,376
I'm very nervous -- I mean,

999
00:30:08,446 --> 00:30:09,876
excited to tell you about

1000
00:30:09,876 --> 00:30:11,676
creating custom input views.

1001
00:30:12,426 --> 00:30:14,946
So, Shuchen briefly mentioned a

1002
00:30:14,946 --> 00:30:16,726
UI Responder property called

1003
00:30:16,726 --> 00:30:18,266
Keyboard Type, which allows you

1004
00:30:18,266 --> 00:30:20,586
to access a lot of the built-in

1005
00:30:20,586 --> 00:30:22,156
iOS system keyboards for

1006
00:30:22,156 --> 00:30:24,506
specialized input, such as the

1007
00:30:24,506 --> 00:30:25,956
decimal pad for entering decimal

1008
00:30:25,956 --> 00:30:27,676
numbers, and we also have a

1009
00:30:27,676 --> 00:30:29,006
phone pad for entering phone

1010
00:30:29,006 --> 00:30:30,916
numbers, and a special keyboard

1011
00:30:30,916 --> 00:30:32,366
just for URLs and email

1012
00:30:32,366 --> 00:30:32,936
addresses.

1013
00:30:33,566 --> 00:30:34,766
Sometimes though, this may not

1014
00:30:34,766 --> 00:30:36,286
be enough for your application.

1015
00:30:36,646 --> 00:30:38,066
You may want to go beyond what

1016
00:30:38,066 --> 00:30:39,136
the system keyboard provides

1017
00:30:39,136 --> 00:30:39,376
you.

1018
00:30:40,026 --> 00:30:41,166
Let's take a look at a couple of

1019
00:30:41,166 --> 00:30:42,000
examples.

1020
00:30:43,066 --> 00:30:44,266
So, mathematics is a pretty good

1021
00:30:44,266 --> 00:30:44,786
example.

1022
00:30:45,156 --> 00:30:46,306
In math, there's a lot of custom

1023
00:30:46,306 --> 00:30:48,076
symbols like Greek letters,

1024
00:30:48,406 --> 00:30:50,106
superscript operators, and

1025
00:30:50,106 --> 00:30:51,176
subscript operators.

1026
00:30:51,436 --> 00:30:52,706
It could be pretty difficult to

1027
00:30:52,706 --> 00:30:54,406
type something like this with

1028
00:30:54,406 --> 00:30:55,936
the built-in system keyboard.

1029
00:30:56,386 --> 00:30:59,216
Swift Playgrounds is another

1030
00:30:59,216 --> 00:30:59,866
good example.

1031
00:31:00,426 --> 00:31:01,396
This is the Swift Playgrounds

1032
00:31:01,396 --> 00:31:01,556
app.

1033
00:31:01,556 --> 00:31:02,866
They have the standard QWERTY

1034
00:31:02,866 --> 00:31:04,276
layout, but they provide a lot

1035
00:31:04,276 --> 00:31:05,626
of additional functionality for

1036
00:31:05,626 --> 00:31:06,766
frequently used symbols in the

1037
00:31:06,766 --> 00:31:07,816
Swift programming language.

1038
00:31:08,806 --> 00:31:10,006
And they also have a really nice

1039
00:31:10,006 --> 00:31:11,426
accessory bar in the top here,

1040
00:31:11,926 --> 00:31:13,186
for quickly inputting relevant

1041
00:31:13,186 --> 00:31:14,376
functions and symbols.

1042
00:31:14,916 --> 00:31:19,126
And then lastly, Apple numbers,

1043
00:31:19,216 --> 00:31:20,316
spreadsheets, is another good

1044
00:31:20,316 --> 00:31:20,786
example.

1045
00:31:21,206 --> 00:31:22,966
So, there's a formula entry bar

1046
00:31:22,966 --> 00:31:24,316
here, which also requires a lot

1047
00:31:24,316 --> 00:31:26,326
of custom symbols, and they also

1048
00:31:26,326 --> 00:31:27,286
have a nice, dark gray

1049
00:31:27,286 --> 00:31:28,656
background here, so it blends in

1050
00:31:28,656 --> 00:31:29,836
really nicely with the system

1051
00:31:29,836 --> 00:31:30,266
keyboard.

1052
00:31:32,856 --> 00:31:34,566
So, going back to our CatChat

1053
00:31:34,566 --> 00:31:35,816
app, it's another pretty good

1054
00:31:35,816 --> 00:31:37,366
example for something that needs

1055
00:31:37,366 --> 00:31:38,266
a custom input view.

1056
00:31:38,556 --> 00:31:41,186
Why? Well, right now, we have a

1057
00:31:41,186 --> 00:31:42,586
way to talk to our pets, but our

1058
00:31:42,586 --> 00:31:43,436
pets don't have a way to talk

1059
00:31:43,436 --> 00:31:44,066
back to us.

1060
00:31:45,046 --> 00:31:46,466
And that's because, they have a

1061
00:31:46,466 --> 00:31:47,476
lot of trouble using the QWERTY

1062
00:31:47,476 --> 00:31:47,946
keyboard.

1063
00:31:48,016 --> 00:31:49,376
Their paws are quite large.

1064
00:31:49,686 --> 00:31:50,826
The keys are really small.

1065
00:31:51,306 --> 00:31:52,886
And so, they have a lot of

1066
00:31:52,886 --> 00:31:54,476
difficulty hitting those keys.

1067
00:31:54,886 --> 00:31:56,416
Plus, they have a really limited

1068
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:57,366
vocabulary too.

1069
00:31:57,706 --> 00:31:58,366
So, they don't really need to

1070
00:31:58,366 --> 00:31:59,076
say a whole lot.

1071
00:32:00,146 --> 00:32:01,666
So, let's say we want to make a

1072
00:32:01,666 --> 00:32:02,656
keyboard just for them,

1073
00:32:02,656 --> 00:32:03,966
accessible to cats and dogs.

1074
00:32:04,966 --> 00:32:06,456
So, maybe we want just large

1075
00:32:06,456 --> 00:32:08,516
graphical buttons to represent

1076
00:32:08,516 --> 00:32:09,926
their entire small vocabulary.

1077
00:32:10,446 --> 00:32:12,216
So, here's what that might look

1078
00:32:12,216 --> 00:32:12,446
like.

1079
00:32:13,016 --> 00:32:16,746
This is our PetChat app, again.

1080
00:32:16,996 --> 00:32:18,506
It's the -- it's got the cool,

1081
00:32:18,506 --> 00:32:20,316
expanding text view that Kasia

1082
00:32:20,316 --> 00:32:21,346
built for us earlier.

1083
00:32:21,756 --> 00:32:24,476
And now, on the pet side, we

1084
00:32:24,476 --> 00:32:25,676
have three, large graphical

1085
00:32:25,676 --> 00:32:27,426
buttons with -- representing

1086
00:32:27,426 --> 00:32:28,476
their entire vocabulary of

1087
00:32:28,476 --> 00:32:29,396
things they might want to say

1088
00:32:29,396 --> 00:32:30,566
like, "I need food," "I want to

1089
00:32:30,566 --> 00:32:31,596
go outside," and "Stop petting

1090
00:32:31,596 --> 00:32:31,696
me."

1091
00:32:31,936 --> 00:32:33,106
Something like that.

1092
00:32:34,436 --> 00:32:37,016
The other cool thing too is that

1093
00:32:37,016 --> 00:32:38,056
this behaves just like the

1094
00:32:38,056 --> 00:32:39,796
system keyboard does.

1095
00:32:39,796 --> 00:32:40,636
It sits at the bottom of the

1096
00:32:40,636 --> 00:32:41,226
screen.

1097
00:32:41,516 --> 00:32:42,696
There's an accessory bar at the

1098
00:32:42,696 --> 00:32:44,046
top that's laid out, right at

1099
00:32:44,046 --> 00:32:44,656
the top of the -- where the

1100
00:32:44,656 --> 00:32:46,036
keyboard would go.

1101
00:32:46,306 --> 00:32:47,596
And then also the scroll view in

1102
00:32:47,596 --> 00:32:48,836
the background, automatically

1103
00:32:48,836 --> 00:32:51,286
adapts its content insets to the

1104
00:32:51,326 --> 00:32:52,916
size of your custom input view.

1105
00:32:53,476 --> 00:32:55,526
So, let's go into a little bit

1106
00:32:55,526 --> 00:32:57,266
more detail, about how to build

1107
00:32:57,266 --> 00:32:58,196
something like this.

1108
00:32:59,086 --> 00:33:01,886
So, for our PetChat app, to

1109
00:32:59,086 --> 00:33:01,886
So, for our PetChat app, to

1110
00:33:01,886 --> 00:33:02,816
create something like this, all

1111
00:33:02,816 --> 00:33:04,826
we need to do is subclass UI

1112
00:33:04,826 --> 00:33:05,826
Input View Controller.

1113
00:33:06,296 --> 00:33:07,726
And by doing that, we get a lot

1114
00:33:07,726 --> 00:33:09,436
of stuff for free, such as the

1115
00:33:09,436 --> 00:33:10,936
blurry gray background that

1116
00:33:10,936 --> 00:33:12,436
mimics the system keyboard's

1117
00:33:12,436 --> 00:33:12,876
appearance.

1118
00:33:13,566 --> 00:33:15,836
But most importantly, we provide

1119
00:33:15,836 --> 00:33:17,216
you a way to access the

1120
00:33:17,216 --> 00:33:18,926
currently interactive text field

1121
00:33:18,926 --> 00:33:19,956
that the user has selected.

1122
00:33:20,586 --> 00:33:21,716
And we do this via a special

1123
00:33:21,716 --> 00:33:23,546
property, called Text Document

1124
00:33:23,546 --> 00:33:24,036
Proxy.

1125
00:33:24,786 --> 00:33:26,026
Now the Text Document Proxy

1126
00:33:26,026 --> 00:33:27,766
allows you to access things like

1127
00:33:27,766 --> 00:33:29,096
the text input traits for the

1128
00:33:29,096 --> 00:33:30,336
currently selected text field.

1129
00:33:30,686 --> 00:33:31,656
So, that would be stuff like

1130
00:33:31,656 --> 00:33:33,096
whether or not it's a password

1131
00:33:33,096 --> 00:33:34,736
field, what kind of content type

1132
00:33:34,736 --> 00:33:36,726
it prefers, and even what kind

1133
00:33:36,726 --> 00:33:37,736
of keyboard type it prefers.

1134
00:33:37,736 --> 00:33:39,186
So, you can adapt as necessary.

1135
00:33:39,996 --> 00:33:41,496
But most importantly, the Text

1136
00:33:41,496 --> 00:33:43,286
Document Proxy also allows you

1137
00:33:43,286 --> 00:33:45,036
to insert text into the text

1138
00:33:45,036 --> 00:33:47,336
field, via a simple method

1139
00:33:47,336 --> 00:33:48,506
called Insert Text, which just

1140
00:33:48,506 --> 00:33:49,046
takes a string.

1141
00:33:49,816 --> 00:33:50,716
Oh, and one more thing that you

1142
00:33:50,716 --> 00:33:51,846
can do with the Text Document

1143
00:33:51,846 --> 00:33:52,526
Proxy too.

1144
00:33:52,786 --> 00:33:53,786
You can access where the

1145
00:33:53,786 --> 00:33:55,756
insertion point position is, and

1146
00:33:55,756 --> 00:33:57,526
the text before and after the

1147
00:33:57,526 --> 00:33:58,186
insertion point.

1148
00:33:59,156 --> 00:33:59,576
Pretty cool.

1149
00:34:00,196 --> 00:34:01,726
So, let's talk about how we can

1150
00:34:01,726 --> 00:34:03,406
actually get this inside of our

1151
00:34:03,406 --> 00:34:03,946
PetChat app.

1152
00:34:04,026 --> 00:34:04,956
Well, let's go back to our old

1153
00:34:04,956 --> 00:34:06,556
friend here, the conversation

1154
00:34:06,556 --> 00:34:07,226
view controller.

1155
00:34:08,466 --> 00:34:09,476
So, to get it to show up in our

1156
00:34:09,476 --> 00:34:10,906
conversation view controller, we

1157
00:34:10,906 --> 00:34:13,116
simply need to instantiate our

1158
00:34:13,116 --> 00:34:14,485
custom input view as a member

1159
00:34:14,485 --> 00:34:14,996
variable.

1160
00:34:15,686 --> 00:34:17,076
And then, override a UI

1161
00:34:17,076 --> 00:34:18,226
Responder method called Can

1162
00:34:18,226 --> 00:34:19,646
Become First Responder, to

1163
00:34:19,646 --> 00:34:21,485
return True, so that it becomes

1164
00:34:21,485 --> 00:34:22,426
a part of the responder chain.

1165
00:34:22,876 --> 00:34:25,246
And then lastly, all we need to

1166
00:34:25,246 --> 00:34:26,556
do, is override this other UI

1167
00:34:26,556 --> 00:34:27,806
Responder method called Input

1168
00:34:27,806 --> 00:34:28,076
View.

1169
00:34:28,076 --> 00:34:30,056
And then just return our custom

1170
00:34:30,056 --> 00:34:30,936
input view instance.

1171
00:34:31,886 --> 00:34:33,106
Now, if you're using things like

1172
00:34:33,106 --> 00:34:35,306
UI Text View or UI Text Field,

1173
00:34:35,565 --> 00:34:36,565
you actually don't need to do

1174
00:34:36,565 --> 00:34:37,386
most of this.

1175
00:34:37,775 --> 00:34:39,406
UI Text View and UI Text Field,

1176
00:34:39,406 --> 00:34:41,696
the input view property is a

1177
00:34:41,696 --> 00:34:42,626
writable property.

1178
00:34:42,946 --> 00:34:44,085
So, all you really need to do is

1179
00:34:44,085 --> 00:34:45,946
actually just assign your custom

1180
00:34:45,946 --> 00:34:49,016
input view instance to the input

1181
00:34:49,016 --> 00:34:49,505
view property.

1182
00:34:50,076 --> 00:34:52,686
So, now, our pets have a way of

1183
00:34:52,686 --> 00:34:54,456
talking back to us in the

1184
00:34:54,456 --> 00:34:56,726
PetChat app, but let's say they

1185
00:34:56,726 --> 00:34:57,596
actually do kind of want to

1186
00:34:57,596 --> 00:34:59,026
break out a little bit and start

1187
00:34:59,026 --> 00:35:00,126
Tweeting or maybe writing a

1188
00:34:59,026 --> 00:35:00,126
Tweeting or maybe writing a

1189
00:35:00,126 --> 00:35:00,526
blog.

1190
00:35:00,916 --> 00:35:01,716
I'm sure they have a lot of

1191
00:35:01,716 --> 00:35:02,776
interesting things to say with

1192
00:35:02,776 --> 00:35:06,176
that small vocabulary of theirs.

1193
00:35:06,346 --> 00:35:07,866
So, in iOS 8, we actually added

1194
00:35:07,866 --> 00:35:09,426
the ability to create custom

1195
00:35:09,426 --> 00:35:10,866
keyboard extensions, so that it

1196
00:35:10,866 --> 00:35:12,126
runs anywhere in the system.

1197
00:35:12,126 --> 00:35:13,076
This is actually our first time

1198
00:35:13,076 --> 00:35:14,486
talking about it at WWDC.

1199
00:35:15,796 --> 00:35:18,086
So, here's what our custom

1200
00:35:18,086 --> 00:35:19,216
keyboard extension might look

1201
00:35:19,216 --> 00:35:20,366
like, running inside of

1202
00:35:20,366 --> 00:35:20,896
messages.

1203
00:35:21,406 --> 00:35:23,486
So, you can -- your pets can

1204
00:35:23,486 --> 00:35:25,456
chat anywhere, or type into

1205
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:26,476
Twitter or keep a blog or

1206
00:35:26,476 --> 00:35:26,856
something.

1207
00:35:27,636 --> 00:35:29,456
So, it's actually really easy to

1208
00:35:29,456 --> 00:35:31,216
go from an input view into a

1209
00:35:31,216 --> 00:35:32,216
custom keyboard extension.

1210
00:35:32,216 --> 00:35:33,536
And so, I'm going to give you a

1211
00:35:33,536 --> 00:35:34,756
quick demo and show you how to

1212
00:35:34,756 --> 00:35:35,126
do that.

1213
00:35:35,626 --> 00:35:36,456
So, let's switch over to the

1214
00:35:36,456 --> 00:35:39,316
computer here.

1215
00:35:39,526 --> 00:35:41,556
Okay, so this is our custom

1216
00:35:42,866 --> 00:35:44,396
input view controller here.

1217
00:35:44,446 --> 00:35:45,476
I'm not going to go into too

1218
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:46,506
much detail about how it was

1219
00:35:46,506 --> 00:35:47,946
built, but our sample code is

1220
00:35:47,946 --> 00:35:48,936
uploaded online.

1221
00:35:49,106 --> 00:35:50,186
So, you can download all this

1222
00:35:50,186 --> 00:35:51,196
yourself if you want to take a

1223
00:35:51,196 --> 00:35:51,636
look at it.

1224
00:35:52,916 --> 00:35:54,666
But to take -- let's go ahead

1225
00:35:54,666 --> 00:35:55,796
and build and run this first to

1226
00:35:55,796 --> 00:35:57,006
see what it looks like inside of

1227
00:35:57,526 --> 00:36:00,446
our app.

1228
00:35:57,526 --> 00:36:00,446
our app.

1229
00:36:00,716 --> 00:36:01,896
Build and run.

1230
00:36:15,116 --> 00:36:16,476
Alright, so here's our custom

1231
00:36:16,476 --> 00:36:17,656
input view running inside of our

1232
00:36:17,656 --> 00:36:17,746
app.

1233
00:36:17,746 --> 00:36:18,996
And so, I'm going to pretend

1234
00:36:18,996 --> 00:36:20,596
like I'm a pet and just start

1235
00:36:20,596 --> 00:36:21,356
saying what I'm feeling.

1236
00:36:21,356 --> 00:36:22,186
I didn't have breakfast this

1237
00:36:22,186 --> 00:36:24,466
morning, so I'll do something

1238
00:36:24,466 --> 00:36:24,836
like that.

1239
00:36:25,676 --> 00:36:27,166
So, now, if we actually want to

1240
00:36:27,166 --> 00:36:28,586
take this custom input view and

1241
00:36:28,586 --> 00:36:29,516
convert it into a third-party

1242
00:36:29,516 --> 00:36:30,736
keyboard extension, it's quite

1243
00:36:30,736 --> 00:36:31,126
easy.

1244
00:36:31,316 --> 00:36:32,306
So, let's switch back over to

1245
00:36:32,306 --> 00:36:33,366
Xcode here and I'll show you how

1246
00:36:33,366 --> 00:36:33,836
to do that.

1247
00:36:33,836 --> 00:36:36,296
So, first, I'm going to go over

1248
00:36:36,296 --> 00:36:37,816
here to the top left, to the

1249
00:36:37,816 --> 00:36:38,586
Project Settings.

1250
00:36:39,206 --> 00:36:40,386
And I'm going to create a new

1251
00:36:40,386 --> 00:36:42,096
target by clicking this plus

1252
00:36:42,096 --> 00:36:43,066
button at the bottom here.

1253
00:36:43,606 --> 00:36:45,676
And so, I'm going to go ahead

1254
00:36:45,676 --> 00:36:47,846
and choose the custom keyboard

1255
00:36:47,846 --> 00:36:49,676
extension template, and click

1256
00:36:49,676 --> 00:36:50,066
Next.

1257
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:51,516
And give it a name.

1258
00:36:52,636 --> 00:36:53,326
I'll just call it Animal

1259
00:36:53,326 --> 00:36:53,806
Keyboard.

1260
00:36:55,376 --> 00:36:57,006
So, now, by doing this, Xcode

1261
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:58,136
actually already gives us a

1262
00:36:58,136 --> 00:36:59,586
bunch of stuff for free.

1263
00:37:00,306 --> 00:37:01,986
For instance, it sets it up so

1264
00:37:01,986 --> 00:37:02,726
that this extension is

1265
00:37:02,726 --> 00:37:04,106
automatically embedded inside of

1266
00:37:04,106 --> 00:37:04,746
your app bundle.

1267
00:37:04,746 --> 00:37:05,666
So, you don't need to mess with

1268
00:37:05,666 --> 00:37:07,056
build settings or build phases

1269
00:37:07,056 --> 00:37:07,716
or anything like that.

1270
00:37:08,746 --> 00:37:11,406
And it also gives us a template,

1271
00:37:12,076 --> 00:37:13,806
UI Input View Controller, here.

1272
00:37:14,296 --> 00:37:15,156
But we actually don't need to

1273
00:37:15,156 --> 00:37:16,226
use this because we already

1274
00:37:16,226 --> 00:37:16,706
wrote one.

1275
00:37:17,036 --> 00:37:18,026
So, I'm just going to tweak

1276
00:37:18,026 --> 00:37:18,976
around with a couple of settings

1277
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:20,606
here, so that our extension

1278
00:37:20,606 --> 00:37:22,416
loads are already built, Custom

1279
00:37:22,416 --> 00:37:23,506
Input View Controller, instead

1280
00:37:23,506 --> 00:37:24,326
of the one that the template

1281
00:37:24,326 --> 00:37:24,886
gives us.

1282
00:37:25,316 --> 00:37:27,646
So, I'm going to go over here to

1283
00:37:27,646 --> 00:37:28,516
our Custom Input View

1284
00:37:28,516 --> 00:37:29,716
Controller, and I'm going to

1285
00:37:29,716 --> 00:37:31,796
check the box over here for our

1286
00:37:31,796 --> 00:37:33,096
keyboard extension so that it's

1287
00:37:33,096 --> 00:37:34,216
a member of that target.

1288
00:37:34,816 --> 00:37:37,756
And then, our keyboard uses a

1289
00:37:37,756 --> 00:37:38,966
couple of other resources.

1290
00:37:39,216 --> 00:37:40,386
It has a couple of localized

1291
00:37:40,386 --> 00:37:40,966
strings.

1292
00:37:40,966 --> 00:37:41,976
So, I'm also going to go ahead

1293
00:37:41,976 --> 00:37:43,636
and switch to localized strings

1294
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:45,246
and check this checkbox to make

1295
00:37:45,246 --> 00:37:46,136
sure it's part of that target.

1296
00:37:46,616 --> 00:37:47,896
And then lastly, it also has a

1297
00:37:47,896 --> 00:37:50,406
couple of assets that it uses

1298
00:37:50,736 --> 00:37:51,566
for images.

1299
00:37:51,566 --> 00:37:52,736
So, I'm going to check this box.

1300
00:37:53,276 --> 00:37:55,376
And then, one more thing I have

1301
00:37:55,376 --> 00:37:55,536
to do.

1302
00:37:55,536 --> 00:37:56,616
I'm going to go over to the info

1303
00:37:56,616 --> 00:37:58,716
P-list here, that it generated

1304
00:37:58,716 --> 00:38:00,246
for our custom keyboard

1305
00:37:58,716 --> 00:38:00,246
for our custom keyboard

1306
00:38:00,246 --> 00:38:01,716
extension, and change its

1307
00:38:01,716 --> 00:38:03,016
principle class to the one that

1308
00:38:03,016 --> 00:38:04,696
we already made, from the one

1309
00:38:04,696 --> 00:38:05,656
that the template gave us.

1310
00:38:11,026 --> 00:38:12,046
And that's pretty much it.

1311
00:38:12,046 --> 00:38:14,486
So, I'm going to switch back to

1312
00:38:14,486 --> 00:38:16,576
the app target here and build

1313
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:16,976
and run.

1314
00:38:22,956 --> 00:38:24,086
So, now that the app is

1315
00:38:24,086 --> 00:38:25,316
installed on the system, the

1316
00:38:25,316 --> 00:38:26,986
extension came along with it.

1317
00:38:27,656 --> 00:38:30,186
And there used to be -- now we

1318
00:38:30,186 --> 00:38:31,816
have to enable the custom

1319
00:38:31,816 --> 00:38:33,426
keyboard extension in the System

1320
00:38:33,426 --> 00:38:34,726
Settings, and there used to be a

1321
00:38:34,726 --> 00:38:35,926
really convoluted way to do

1322
00:38:35,926 --> 00:38:36,256
that.

1323
00:38:36,446 --> 00:38:38,276
But in new, in iOS 11, we

1324
00:38:38,276 --> 00:38:39,586
actually made it much simpler

00:38:39,586 --> 00:38:40,856
for your users to enable your

00:38:42,826 --> 00:38:43,616
that works right now.

with a Settings Bundle.

"keyboards."

check this one switch.

00:39:18,276 --> 00:39:18,986
love that.

Thanks. So, this is actually my

1366
00:39:48,146 --> 00:39:49,616
personally recommended way for

1367
00:39:49,616 --> 00:39:51,136
you to develop third-party

1368
00:39:51,136 --> 00:39:51,726
keyboards.

1369
00:39:51,796 --> 00:39:53,516
It's really easy to test it

1370
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:55,116
inside of your app first, just

1371
00:39:55,116 --> 00:39:56,286
as a custom input view.

1372
00:39:56,526 --> 00:39:58,126
And then, as you saw, going from

1373
00:39:58,126 --> 00:39:59,476
a custom input view to a custom

1375
00:39:59,476 --> 00:40:00,576
keyboard extension is really

1376
00:40:00,576 --> 00:40:00,916
easy.

1377
00:40:01,066 --> 00:40:06,286
So, that's really the way to go.

1378
00:40:06,526 --> 00:40:08,136
So, just a quick recap of how to

1379
00:40:08,136 --> 00:40:09,516
convert from a custom input view

1380
00:40:09,516 --> 00:40:10,776
to a keyboard extension.

1381
00:40:11,136 --> 00:40:12,616
We just made a new target and we

1382
00:40:12,686 --> 00:40:14,406
used the Custom Keyboard

1383
00:40:14,406 --> 00:40:15,506
Extension Template.

1384
00:40:16,706 --> 00:40:17,886
You can either fill in the

it so that it works with your

own.

1389
00:40:24,146 --> 00:40:25,206
And then lastly, I showed you a

1390
00:40:25,206 --> 00:40:27,396
cool, new user acceleration or a

1391
00:40:27,396 --> 00:40:28,526
cool new acceleration for your

00:40:28,526 --> 00:40:29,736
users to enable your keyboard

00:40:29,736 --> 00:40:30,566
from within your Settings

00:40:31,456 --> 00:40:33,506
But that's not all.

1396
00:40:33,776 --> 00:40:35,036
We have a couple of new APIs in

1397
00:40:35,036 --> 00:40:37,636
iOS 11 that I want to share with

1398
00:40:37,636 --> 00:40:41,236
you tonight -- or today.

1399
00:40:41,416 --> 00:40:42,816
So, you can now access the

1400
00:40:42,816 --> 00:40:44,446
currently selected text that the

1401
00:40:44,446 --> 00:40:46,066
user has selected, which is

1402
00:40:46,066 --> 00:40:47,416
pretty useful if you want to do

1403
00:40:47,416 --> 00:40:49,386
retro correction with your Auto

1404
00:40:49,386 --> 00:40:51,016
Complete Engine, for instance.

1405
00:40:51,326 --> 00:40:52,486
Or provide some kind of cool

1406
00:40:52,486 --> 00:40:54,346
context around the text that the

1407
00:40:54,406 --> 00:40:56,506
user had selected.

1408
00:40:56,506 --> 00:40:57,576
We also provide you this new

1409
00:40:57,576 --> 00:40:58,906
thing called the Document

1410
00:40:58,906 --> 00:41:00,546
Identifier Handle, which is just

1411
00:40:58,906 --> 00:41:00,546
Identifier Handle, which is just

1412
00:41:00,546 --> 00:41:03,156
a UUID, that uniquely identifies

1413
00:41:03,196 --> 00:41:04,446
one text field from the next.

1414
00:41:05,356 --> 00:41:06,846
Now, this is real useful for a

1415
00:41:06,846 --> 00:41:08,076
lot of things, but one of the

1416
00:41:08,076 --> 00:41:09,626
things that it's useful for is

1417
00:41:09,626 --> 00:41:11,306
for resetting your keyboard

1418
00:41:11,306 --> 00:41:12,876
state when the user switches

1419
00:41:12,876 --> 00:41:14,676
text fields, so you can clear

1420
00:41:14,676 --> 00:41:15,836
your predictions if you have

1421
00:41:15,836 --> 00:41:17,806
predictions displayed, or switch

1422
00:41:17,806 --> 00:41:19,486
back to the alphabetic plane if

1423
00:41:19,486 --> 00:41:20,496
the user had switched to your

1424
00:41:20,496 --> 00:41:21,656
numeric plane, or something like

1425
00:41:21,656 --> 00:41:22,000
that.

1426
00:41:24,176 --> 00:41:25,416
And lastly, we also added the

1427
00:41:25,416 --> 00:41:26,596
ability for you to query whether

1428
00:41:26,596 --> 00:41:27,816
or not the user has granted your

1429
00:41:27,816 --> 00:41:29,126
extension full access.

1430
00:41:29,296 --> 00:41:30,416
And I'll go over what full

1431
00:41:30,416 --> 00:41:31,446
access means in just a moment,

1432
00:41:31,446 --> 00:41:32,316
in case you're not familiar.

1433
00:41:33,496 --> 00:41:34,476
But first, I want to talk about

1434
00:41:34,476 --> 00:41:35,756
some other lesser known,

1435
00:41:35,756 --> 00:41:37,036
third-party keyboard APIs that

1436
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:37,836
maybe you didn't know about.

1437
00:41:39,216 --> 00:41:40,986
So, in iOS 10, we actually added

1438
00:41:40,986 --> 00:41:41,886
the ability for you to

1439
00:41:41,886 --> 00:41:43,446
incorporate the System Globe

1441
00:41:45,916 --> 00:41:47,146

1442
00:41:47,146 --> 00:41:48,466
your user can quickly switch

1443
00:41:48,466 --> 00:41:49,896
between all of the keyboards

1444
00:41:49,896 --> 00:41:50,646
that they have selected.

1445
00:41:50,646 --> 00:41:51,856
It's a lot better than that next

1446
00:41:51,856 --> 00:41:52,726

1447
00:41:52,726 --> 00:41:53,156
before.

something that we call the

Supplementary Lexicon.

1455
00:42:03,666 --> 00:42:05,066
The Supplementary Lexicon is

1456
00:42:05,066 --> 00:42:06,646
basically just a list of words

1457
00:42:06,646 --> 00:42:07,836
containing the portion of the

1458
00:42:07,836 --> 00:42:09,606
user's address book, so you can

1459
00:42:09,606 --> 00:42:11,446
auto complete various names and

1460
00:42:11,446 --> 00:42:13,546
stuff, that the user might be

1461
00:42:13,546 --> 00:42:15,156
referencing in the text that

1462
00:42:15,156 --> 00:42:15,496
they type.

1463
00:42:16,546 --> 00:42:17,836
And finally, tying back to some

1464
00:42:17,836 --> 00:42:19,136
of the multilingual support that

1465
00:42:19,136 --> 00:42:21,386
we added in iOS 11, that Shuchen

1466
00:42:21,386 --> 00:42:22,766
was talking about earlier, your

1467
00:42:22,766 --> 00:42:24,166
keyboard can use those document

1468
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:25,486
identifier handle things that I

1469
00:42:25,486 --> 00:42:26,856
was mentioning before, as a

1470
00:42:26,856 --> 00:42:27,706
multilingual hint.

1471
00:42:27,706 --> 00:42:29,516
So, if your keyboard supports

1472
00:42:29,516 --> 00:42:31,416
multiple languages, you too can

1473
00:42:32,076 --> 00:42:33,306
behave like the system keyboard

1474
00:42:33,306 --> 00:42:34,536
does, and change when

1475
00:42:34,536 --> 00:42:34,966
appropriate.

1476
00:42:35,526 --> 00:42:39,046
So, lastly, we can't talk about

1477
00:42:39,046 --> 00:42:40,466
third-party keyboard extensions

1478
00:42:40,466 --> 00:42:41,746
without talking about privacy

1479
00:42:41,746 --> 00:42:42,556
and user trust.

1480
00:42:43,186 --> 00:42:45,936
So, privacy is very much a

1481
00:42:45,936 --> 00:42:48,416
standard iOS feature that users

1482
00:42:48,416 --> 00:42:48,846
expect.

1483
00:42:49,966 --> 00:42:51,846
And users are made aware that

1484
00:42:51,846 --> 00:42:52,926
all of their keystrokes are

1485
00:42:52,926 --> 00:42:54,046
handled by your extension.

1486
00:42:54,546 --> 00:42:55,426
So, if you're doing something

1487
00:42:55,426 --> 00:42:56,786
with those keystrokes, such as

1488
00:42:56,886 --> 00:42:58,286
sending them offsite or

1489
00:42:58,536 --> 00:43:00,056
analyzing them in some way, you

1490
00:42:58,536 --> 00:43:00,056
analyzing them in some way, you

1491
00:43:00,056 --> 00:43:01,066
should make sure to inform the

1492
00:43:01,066 --> 00:43:02,716
user about this, and anonymize

1493
00:43:02,716 --> 00:43:03,866
the data that's coming in, if

1494
00:43:03,866 --> 00:43:04,836
you are sending it offsite.

1495
00:43:05,856 --> 00:43:07,826
And lastly, most applications

1496
00:43:07,976 --> 00:43:09,836
shouldn't actually need it, but

1497
00:43:10,346 --> 00:43:12,226
you can ask the user to provide

1498
00:43:12,226 --> 00:43:14,046
your extension with full access,

1499
00:43:14,276 --> 00:43:15,666
which means access to some lower

1500
00:43:15,666 --> 00:43:16,786
level parts of the system.

1501
00:43:17,266 --> 00:43:18,826
Let's talk a little bit about

1502
00:43:18,826 --> 00:43:20,106
what full access really means.

1503
00:43:20,646 --> 00:43:23,076
So, first of all, there's

1504
00:43:23,076 --> 00:43:24,576
actually quite a bit of value in

1505
00:43:24,576 --> 00:43:26,076
not asking for full access.

1506
00:43:26,356 --> 00:43:27,626
This is why we built the full

1507
00:43:27,626 --> 00:43:28,636
access switch to begin with.

1508
00:43:28,716 --> 00:43:30,126
It's not a speed bump for you

1509
00:43:30,126 --> 00:43:30,666
guys.

1510
00:43:30,906 --> 00:43:32,586
Instead, our Apple customers are

1511
00:43:32,586 --> 00:43:33,816
very privacy conscious.

1512
00:43:34,606 --> 00:43:35,946
Plus, your keyboards already

1513
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:36,896
provide a lot of awesome

1514
00:43:36,896 --> 00:43:37,806
functionality right out of the

1515
00:43:37,806 --> 00:43:39,676
box, without full access.

1516
00:43:39,826 --> 00:43:40,776
So, granting this should really

1517
00:43:40,776 --> 00:43:42,146
only supplement your existing

1518
00:43:42,146 --> 00:43:42,696
feature set.

1519
00:43:43,066 --> 00:43:44,396
So, some examples of things that

1520
00:43:44,396 --> 00:43:46,476
you might need full access for,

1521
00:43:46,636 --> 00:43:47,826
is communicating with your main

1522
00:43:47,826 --> 00:43:48,086
app.

1523
00:43:48,866 --> 00:43:49,646
So, if you need to build a

1524
00:43:49,646 --> 00:43:51,376
bridge from your main app bundle

1525
00:43:51,376 --> 00:43:52,346
to your custom keyboard

1526
00:43:52,346 --> 00:43:53,736
extension, if you want to access

1527
00:43:53,736 --> 00:43:54,796
like a database or something

1528
00:43:54,796 --> 00:43:55,786
that you have stored there,

1529
00:43:56,046 --> 00:43:57,256
you'll need to request for full

1530
00:43:57,256 --> 00:43:57,906
access for that.

1531
00:43:59,046 --> 00:44:00,296
If you want to access a -- if

1532
00:43:59,046 --> 00:44:00,296
If you want to access a -- if

1533
00:44:00,666 --> 00:44:02,236
you want to provide your user

1534
00:44:02,236 --> 00:44:03,776
with a repository of gif images

1535
00:44:03,776 --> 00:44:05,636
for instance, then you'll need

1536
00:44:05,636 --> 00:44:07,936
to ask for full access to grant

1537
00:44:07,936 --> 00:44:09,596
access to the networking stack

1538
00:44:09,596 --> 00:44:10,336
on iOS.

1539
00:44:12,016 --> 00:44:14,026
So, for current location, in

1540
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:15,456
case you want to enrich your

1541
00:44:15,456 --> 00:44:17,266
auto complete results with

1542
00:44:17,266 --> 00:44:18,836
references to locations that the

1543
00:44:18,836 --> 00:44:20,776
user might be referencing to in

1544
00:44:20,776 --> 00:44:22,486
the text that they type, you'll

1545
00:44:22,486 --> 00:44:24,006
need to request for full access

1546
00:44:24,006 --> 00:44:24,926
for the current location.

1547
00:44:25,106 --> 00:44:26,346
And you'll also have to have the

1548
00:44:26,346 --> 00:44:29,096
user grant your main app access

1549
00:44:29,096 --> 00:44:30,176
to your current location too.

1550
00:44:30,326 --> 00:44:31,136
So, keep that in mind.

1551
00:44:31,706 --> 00:44:34,576
And for the address book, most

1552
00:44:34,576 --> 00:44:35,906
applications don't actually need

1553
00:44:35,906 --> 00:44:37,206
this because of what I said

1554
00:44:37,206 --> 00:44:39,046
about the supplementary lexicon.

1555
00:44:39,276 --> 00:44:40,766
So, you actually don't need full

1556
00:44:40,766 --> 00:44:41,746
access to get to the address

1557
00:44:41,746 --> 00:44:41,986
book.

1558
00:44:42,366 --> 00:44:43,446
But, if you want to access some

1559
00:44:43,446 --> 00:44:44,666
more of the address book, like

1560
00:44:44,666 --> 00:44:46,516
the notes fields, or nickname,

1561
00:44:46,516 --> 00:44:47,246
or something like that.

1562
00:44:47,496 --> 00:44:48,446
Then you will need full access

1563
00:44:48,446 --> 00:44:49,886
for that.

1564
00:44:50,066 --> 00:44:51,326
And lastly, make sure that your

1565
00:44:51,326 --> 00:44:52,726
keyboard works without

1566
00:44:52,726 --> 00:44:53,996
requesting for full access.

1567
00:44:54,386 --> 00:44:55,676
Like I said, there's a lot of

1568
00:44:55,676 --> 00:44:57,416
value in not asking for full

1569
00:44:58,746 --> 00:44:59,996
access, and plus, your app will

1570
00:44:59,996 --> 00:45:01,406
actually get rejected if it

1571
00:44:59,996 --> 00:45:01,406
actually get rejected if it

1572
00:45:01,406 --> 00:45:01,756
doesn't.

1573
00:45:02,096 --> 00:45:03,036
Take a look at the App Store

1574
00:45:03,036 --> 00:45:04,266
Guidelines for more information

1575
00:45:04,266 --> 00:45:05,226
about that.

1576
00:45:06,256 --> 00:45:07,876
So, just a quick summary before

1577
00:45:07,876 --> 00:45:09,376
I leave you tonight, or today,

1578
00:45:09,376 --> 00:45:09,756
sorry.

1579
00:45:09,756 --> 00:45:11,886
I did that again.

1580
00:45:12,246 --> 00:45:13,606
Kasia showed you how to design

1581
00:45:13,606 --> 00:45:14,476
your app with the keyboard in

1582
00:45:14,476 --> 00:45:15,756
mind and about keyboard

1583
00:45:15,756 --> 00:45:16,266
avoidance.

1584
00:45:17,066 --> 00:45:18,086
Actually, we don't say

1585
00:45:18,086 --> 00:45:18,556
"avoidance."

1586
00:45:18,556 --> 00:45:19,906
We say, "embrace the keyboard."

1587
00:45:20,266 --> 00:45:21,426
Don't avoid it.

1588
00:45:22,076 --> 00:45:23,316
And Shuchen mentioned some

1589
00:45:23,316 --> 00:45:24,686
advanced traits to enhance the

1590
00:45:24,686 --> 00:45:26,126
user's experience with some of

1591
00:45:26,126 --> 00:45:27,506
the built-in system keyboards

1592
00:45:27,556 --> 00:45:28,406
that you can pick from.

1593
00:45:28,926 --> 00:45:31,446
And if that wasn't enough, we

1594
00:45:31,446 --> 00:45:32,636
showed you how to build custom

1595
00:45:32,636 --> 00:45:33,936
keyboard extensions and custom

1596
00:45:33,936 --> 00:45:35,576
input views, and how going from

1597
00:45:35,576 --> 00:45:36,426
a custom input view to a

1598
00:45:36,426 --> 00:45:37,506
keyboard extension, is actually

1599
00:45:37,506 --> 00:45:38,426
quite a lot easier than you

1600
00:45:38,426 --> 00:45:38,646
think.

1601
00:45:40,156 --> 00:45:41,606
So, make sure to like, comment,

1602
00:45:41,606 --> 00:45:43,406
and subscribe, or check out our

1603
00:45:43,706 --> 00:45:46,096
sample page or sample app, here

1604
00:45:46,216 --> 00:45:48,816
at WWDC 17, Session 242.

1605
00:45:49,116 --> 00:45:50,936
All the code that you saw today,

1606
00:45:51,166 --> 00:45:52,366
is right there.

1607
00:45:52,726 --> 00:45:54,306
So, all the sample code that you

1608
00:45:54,306 --> 00:45:55,216
saw today is right there.

1609
00:45:55,506 --> 00:45:56,226
So, go check it out.

1610
00:45:56,516 --> 00:45:59,006
Here's some related sessions.

1611
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:00,566
The Password Autofill for Apps

1612
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:00,566
The Password Autofill for Apps

1613
00:46:00,566 --> 00:46:01,366
is definitely a good one to

1614
00:46:01,366 --> 00:46:01,906
check out.

1615
00:46:02,266 --> 00:46:03,406
Mysteries of Auto Layout is

1616
00:46:03,406 --> 00:46:05,476
great too for keyboard avoidance

1617
00:46:05,476 --> 00:46:06,836
and -- or keyboard embracing.

1618
00:46:07,666 --> 00:46:07,976
Thank you.

1619
00:46:08,516 --> 00:46:12,500
