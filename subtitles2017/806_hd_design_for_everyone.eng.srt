work for everyone too.

75
00:02:47,976 --> 00:02:50,326
Because we inherently design for

76
00:02:50,326 --> 00:02:52,166
ourselves, because we design to

77
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:54,076

00:06:28,206 --> 00:06:30,216
techniques to keep in mind when

196
00:06:30,216 --> 00:06:31,426
making your apps work for more

197
00:06:31,426 --> 00:06:31,826
people.

198
00:06:32,626 --> 00:06:35,066
By being inclusive, not only can

199
00:06:35,266 --> 00:06:36,816
we help everyone function in

200
00:06:36,816 --> 00:06:37,686
their daily life.

201
00:06:37,816 --> 00:06:38,936
But we can also create new

202
00:06:38,936 --> 00:06:40,686
possibilities throughout

203
00:06:40,686 --> 00:06:41,306
society.

204
00:06:41,766 --> 00:06:43,666
So, today, we're going to talk

205
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:45,486
about three areas of designing

206
00:06:45,486 --> 00:06:46,146
for everyone.

207
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:49,626
Striving for simplicity, making

208
00:06:49,626 --> 00:06:51,326
our apps effortless and easy to

209
00:06:51,326 --> 00:06:51,756
learn.

210
00:06:53,436 --> 00:06:56,026
Accessing perceivability.

211
00:06:56,206 --> 00:06:57,766
Making sure our apps are

212
00:06:57,766 --> 00:06:59,336
understandable through sight,

213
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:00,636
sound, and haptics.

214
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:00,636
sound, and haptics.

215
00:07:01,256 --> 00:07:04,446
And designing with integrity.

216
00:07:04,676 --> 00:07:06,276
Holding ourselves accountable

217
00:07:06,276 --> 00:07:08,026
for ethically making sure we

218
00:07:08,026 --> 00:07:09,116
include everyone.

219
00:07:10,036 --> 00:07:11,796
These are principles applied to

220
00:07:11,796 --> 00:07:13,276
making great experiences,

221
00:07:13,586 --> 00:07:14,166
period.

222
00:07:16,556 --> 00:07:19,266
So, first if we think about

223
00:07:19,266 --> 00:07:20,586
something that is simple to do,

224
00:07:20,996 --> 00:07:22,446
we think of it being effortless

225
00:07:22,556 --> 00:07:24,456
without difficulties, hurdles,

226
00:07:24,456 --> 00:07:25,746
or cognitive strain.

227
00:07:26,626 --> 00:07:28,426
But for something to feel simple

228
00:07:28,426 --> 00:07:29,646
that does mean it can't do

229
00:07:29,646 --> 00:07:30,626
complex things.

230
00:07:31,406 --> 00:07:32,776
It just means trying to achieve

231
00:07:32,776 --> 00:07:34,546
desired outcomes in the most

232
00:07:34,546 --> 00:07:35,956
effortless and elegant way

233
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:36,596
possible.

234
00:07:37,586 --> 00:07:38,986
Things that aren't simple create

235
00:07:38,986 --> 00:07:41,156
barriers of entry to everyone.

236
00:07:41,756 --> 00:07:45,996
As we go through our day, the

237
00:07:45,996 --> 00:07:47,476
requirements of work and life

238
00:07:47,606 --> 00:07:49,086
slowly drains our energy.

239
00:07:49,796 --> 00:07:51,656
And when we are low on energy,

240
00:07:51,886 --> 00:07:53,356
we have less energy to

241
00:07:53,356 --> 00:07:55,176
troubleshoot tech and less

242
00:07:55,176 --> 00:07:56,306
patience for navigating

243
00:07:56,306 --> 00:07:57,286
something that should be quick

244
00:07:57,286 --> 00:07:57,796
and easy.

245
00:07:59,066 --> 00:08:01,476
At night, we rest and recharge.

246
00:07:59,066 --> 00:08:01,476
At night, we rest and recharge.

247
00:08:03,456 --> 00:08:06,206
However, were you aware that one

248
00:08:06,206 --> 00:08:07,556
in six children in the United

249
00:08:07,556 --> 00:08:08,746
States have a developmental

250
00:08:08,746 --> 00:08:09,636
disability?

251
00:08:10,316 --> 00:08:11,346
It ranges from mild

252
00:08:11,346 --> 00:08:12,636
disabilities, such as speech and

253
00:08:12,636 --> 00:08:14,566
language impairments to serious

254
00:08:14,566 --> 00:08:16,366
developmental disabilities, such

255
00:08:16,366 --> 00:08:18,026
as intellectual disabilities and

256
00:08:18,026 --> 00:08:18,616
autism.

257
00:08:19,836 --> 00:08:21,696
For people who have cognitive

258
00:08:21,696 --> 00:08:23,486
disabilities and/or chronic

259
00:08:23,486 --> 00:08:25,546
illnesses, they might start out

260
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:27,206
the day at three-quarters of a

261
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:27,536
tank.

262
00:08:28,006 --> 00:08:29,686
And tasks take extra effort

263
00:08:29,686 --> 00:08:30,726
throughout the day.

264
00:08:31,646 --> 00:08:34,015
Plus, if you exert yourself all

265
00:08:34,015 --> 00:08:35,885
the way to empty on one day, you

266
00:08:36,186 --> 00:08:37,496
might start out the next day,

267
00:08:37,496 --> 00:08:38,486
extremely low.

268
00:08:39,566 --> 00:08:42,025
So, the apps that we make do a

269
00:08:42,025 --> 00:08:44,186
great job at helping us through

270
00:08:44,186 --> 00:08:44,626
our day.

271
00:08:45,076 --> 00:08:46,706
Whether it's a convenience or

272
00:08:46,706 --> 00:08:48,046
helping us to recharge.

273
00:08:49,676 --> 00:08:51,046
They provide quick and easy

274
00:08:51,046 --> 00:08:53,196
access to services, which is

275
00:08:53,196 --> 00:08:55,296
extremely important for those

276
00:08:55,386 --> 00:08:56,346
who may have difficulty

277
00:08:56,346 --> 00:08:57,766
traveling outside of the home,

278
00:08:58,106 --> 00:08:59,596
speaking a hearing on the phone,

279
00:09:00,076 --> 00:09:01,826
or juggling work and home life.

280
00:09:03,566 --> 00:09:06,026
For example, convenience apps

281
00:09:06,026 --> 00:09:08,346
like Instacart, you can have

282
00:09:08,346 --> 00:09:10,086
groceries delivered to your door

283
00:09:10,566 --> 00:09:11,756
which alleviates the stress of

284
00:09:11,756 --> 00:09:13,836
the supermarket, or allows you

285
00:09:13,836 --> 00:09:14,686
to rest at home.

286
00:09:14,746 --> 00:09:16,816
Or maybe it just gives you time

287
00:09:16,816 --> 00:09:17,806
back with your family.

288
00:09:19,646 --> 00:09:20,886
With education apps like

289
00:09:20,886 --> 00:09:23,366
Doulingo it's incredible that we

290
00:09:23,366 --> 00:09:25,636
can learn from the comforts of

291
00:09:25,636 --> 00:09:28,046
our home, on our own time, at

292
00:09:28,046 --> 00:09:31,716
our own speed, and with health

293
00:09:31,716 --> 00:09:33,756
apps like Calm, they help us

294
00:09:33,756 --> 00:09:35,466
nurture our mental and physical

295
00:09:35,466 --> 00:09:36,166
well-being.

296
00:09:36,796 --> 00:09:39,716
And with content creation apps

297
00:09:39,716 --> 00:09:41,696
like iMovie, we can create and

298
00:09:41,696 --> 00:09:43,676
share our artistry with friends,

299
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:44,996
family and the world.

300
00:09:46,636 --> 00:09:48,526
So, apps play a key role in our

301
00:09:48,526 --> 00:09:49,626
daily lives now.

302
00:09:50,086 --> 00:09:51,906
And we can make even more impact

303
00:09:52,016 --> 00:09:53,756
in people's lives by reducing

304
00:09:53,756 --> 00:09:55,376
the amount of effort that we

305
00:09:55,376 --> 00:09:57,726
require to use our apps, which

306
00:09:57,726 --> 00:10:00,116
reduces barriers and provides

307
00:09:57,726 --> 00:10:00,116
reduces barriers and provides

308
00:10:00,116 --> 00:10:01,016
more access.

309
00:10:02,046 --> 00:10:03,196
But this is easier said than

310
00:10:03,196 --> 00:10:03,556
done.

311
00:10:03,796 --> 00:10:04,856
So here are some ideas.

312
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:08,416
We should strive for our apps to

313
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:10,406
be easy to navigate by having

314
00:10:10,406 --> 00:10:11,816
them similarly structured.

315
00:10:11,816 --> 00:10:14,826
We need to be able to get

316
00:10:14,876 --> 00:10:17,106
started and complete common task

317
00:10:17,256 --> 00:10:18,636
without encountering any

318
00:10:18,636 --> 00:10:19,996
barriers or issues.

319
00:10:21,636 --> 00:10:23,616
And we should use UIKit as much

320
00:10:23,616 --> 00:10:25,236
as possible to achieve the

321
00:10:25,236 --> 00:10:27,086
consistent behaviors within each

322
00:10:27,086 --> 00:10:28,566
app and across apps.

323
00:10:29,016 --> 00:10:30,966
Because UIKit wasn't made for

324
00:10:30,966 --> 00:10:32,006
just developers.

325
00:10:32,226 --> 00:10:33,856
It's a design language for the

326
00:10:33,856 --> 00:10:35,886
platform that everyone is

327
00:10:35,956 --> 00:10:37,466
familiar with and knows how to

328
00:10:37,466 --> 00:10:37,966
use.

329
00:10:38,506 --> 00:10:41,506
And there are design resources

330
00:10:41,506 --> 00:10:43,386
on human interface guidelines to

331
00:10:43,386 --> 00:10:45,026
help you use the standard UIKit

332
00:10:45,026 --> 00:10:46,866
components in your apps during

333
00:10:46,866 --> 00:10:47,596
the design phase.

334
00:10:48,316 --> 00:10:50,356
It's important to remember that

335
00:10:50,356 --> 00:10:52,256
these toolkits support many

336
00:10:52,256 --> 00:10:54,146
accessibility accommodations.

337
00:10:55,456 --> 00:10:58,086
And if we can consistently use

338
00:10:58,086 --> 00:10:59,496
standard UIKit interaction

339
00:10:59,496 --> 00:11:01,416
patterns and components for more

340
00:10:59,496 --> 00:11:01,416
patterns and components for more

341
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:03,446
task of our apps like basic

342
00:11:03,446 --> 00:11:05,096
structure and navigation,

343
00:11:05,466 --> 00:11:07,566
sign-up flows, account settings,

344
00:11:07,566 --> 00:11:10,846
and sharing then you can spend

345
00:11:10,846 --> 00:11:12,596
the majority of your time on the

346
00:11:12,596 --> 00:11:14,116
parts of your apps that make

347
00:11:14,116 --> 00:11:14,746
them special.

348
00:11:15,426 --> 00:11:17,076
And making sure those parts are

349
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:17,966
accessible too.

350
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:21,226
Consistent use of our design

351
00:11:21,226 --> 00:11:23,166
language is beneficial because

352
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:25,066
if you learn one app you have a

353
00:11:25,136 --> 00:11:27,386
serious head start on learning

354
00:11:27,386 --> 00:11:30,996
another because repetition

355
00:11:30,996 --> 00:11:32,676
creates cognitive ease and a

356
00:11:32,676 --> 00:11:33,766
comforting feeling of

357
00:11:33,766 --> 00:11:34,546
familiarity.

358
00:11:35,086 --> 00:11:37,846
But we know it's not always

359
00:11:37,846 --> 00:11:40,176
possible, to solely use UIKit.

360
00:11:40,176 --> 00:11:41,326
There are times when you need to

361
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:42,546
do something unique and

362
00:11:42,546 --> 00:11:44,626
original, but don't forget about

363
00:11:44,626 --> 00:11:45,406
accessibility.

364
00:11:45,406 --> 00:11:47,276
It makes you think more

365
00:11:47,276 --> 00:11:48,636
holistically about the products

366
00:11:48,636 --> 00:11:49,526
that you're putting out into the

367
00:11:49,526 --> 00:11:49,856
world.

368
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:52,886
So, simplicity.

369
00:11:52,886 --> 00:11:54,536
Building on what I know.

370
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:57,006
Making use of standard

371
00:11:57,006 --> 00:11:58,486
components and familiar

372
00:11:58,486 --> 00:12:00,266
interaction patterns to help

373
00:11:58,486 --> 00:12:00,266
interaction patterns to help

374
00:12:00,266 --> 00:12:02,846
make apps easy to navigate.

375
00:12:03,766 --> 00:12:05,436
Be laser focused in your

376
00:12:05,436 --> 00:12:06,056
objectives.

377
00:12:06,526 --> 00:12:07,726
Reduce any hurdles.

378
00:12:08,066 --> 00:12:09,616
Help me get started quickly.

379
00:12:09,616 --> 00:12:12,286
And it just works like I

380
00:12:12,286 --> 00:12:13,936
expected it to consistently.

381
00:12:16,596 --> 00:12:20,146
So, our products need to be

382
00:12:20,146 --> 00:12:22,086
understandable and perceivable

383
00:12:22,086 --> 00:12:22,696
to everyone.

384
00:12:23,656 --> 00:12:25,186
This means that information

385
00:12:25,586 --> 00:12:27,046
needs to be available to at

386
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:29,196
least one sense; sight, sound or

387
00:12:29,196 --> 00:12:31,156
touch that is available to each

388
00:12:31,156 --> 00:12:31,606
person.

389
00:12:31,856 --> 00:12:34,606
And we can look at our apps and

390
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:36,736
ask ourselves is it legible?

391
00:12:36,736 --> 00:12:38,526
Is it audible?

392
00:12:38,526 --> 00:12:39,956
And is it tactile?

393
00:12:41,366 --> 00:12:43,396
But before we look at

394
00:12:43,396 --> 00:12:44,506
legibility.

395
00:12:44,506 --> 00:12:45,976
Let's escape for a moment to

396
00:12:45,976 --> 00:12:47,056
this beautiful beach and

397
00:12:47,056 --> 00:12:49,586
experience it in a few different

398
00:12:49,586 --> 00:12:49,866
ways.

399
00:12:51,656 --> 00:12:54,396
Relax, watch the waves roll in

400
00:12:54,396 --> 00:12:54,816
and out.

401
00:12:55,186 --> 00:12:56,596
Soak up that sunshine for a

402
00:12:56,596 --> 00:12:56,936
second.

403
00:13:02,056 --> 00:13:03,326
And if you have vision loss, you

404
00:13:03,326 --> 00:13:05,136
might not get to see this in all

405
00:13:05,136 --> 00:13:07,096
of its glory, but you're hearing

406
00:13:07,346 --> 00:13:08,786
would be more sensitive to these

407
00:13:08,826 --> 00:13:09,686
beautiful sounds.

408
00:13:10,516 --> 00:13:15,806
[ Ocean Sounds ]

409
00:13:16,306 --> 00:13:18,056
Or if you're colorblind, you

410
00:13:18,056 --> 00:13:19,346
might see the world more like

411
00:13:19,426 --> 00:13:19,606
this.

412
00:13:24,176 --> 00:13:26,066
Or if you're blind, you're

413
00:13:26,066 --> 00:13:28,076
likely even more in-tune to the

414
00:13:31,716 --> 00:13:31,836
sound.

415
00:13:33,096 --> 00:13:34,656
And these situations are very

416
00:13:34,656 --> 00:13:35,066
real.

417
00:13:35,146 --> 00:13:38,316
In the world, 285 million people

418
00:13:38,316 --> 00:13:39,616
are estimated to have moderate

419
00:13:39,616 --> 00:13:41,576
or severe vision loss.

420
00:13:41,986 --> 00:13:43,946
And 39 million of those are

421
00:13:43,946 --> 00:13:44,736
completely blind.

422
00:13:46,736 --> 00:13:48,566
And one in 12 men are

423
00:13:48,566 --> 00:13:49,286
colorblind.

424
00:13:50,856 --> 00:13:52,326
And best estimates are around

425
00:13:52,326 --> 00:13:54,696
360 million people in the world

426
00:13:54,696 --> 00:13:56,226
have disabling hearing loss.

427
00:13:56,776 --> 00:13:59,456
Not only can hearing and vision

428
00:13:59,456 --> 00:14:00,856
loss limit people from

429
00:13:59,456 --> 00:14:00,856
loss limit people from

430
00:14:00,856 --> 00:14:02,416
distinguishing information, but

431
00:14:02,756 --> 00:14:04,236
they will also be seeing and

432
00:14:04,236 --> 00:14:05,646
hearing your brand in different

433
00:14:05,646 --> 00:14:06,806
ways than you expected.

434
00:14:07,296 --> 00:14:09,916
For example, someone with low

435
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:13,066
vision may see their phones like

436
00:14:13,066 --> 00:14:13,486
this.

437
00:14:14,506 --> 00:14:16,086
And if you aren't low vision

438
00:14:16,086 --> 00:14:17,836
yourself, you can simulate low

439
00:14:17,836 --> 00:14:19,856
vision by using a small blur in

440
00:14:19,856 --> 00:14:20,856
your design software.

441
00:14:22,756 --> 00:14:24,376
Now, people with low vision will

442
00:14:24,376 --> 00:14:26,126
often learn the location of

443
00:14:26,126 --> 00:14:27,866
icons as long as they don't

444
00:14:27,866 --> 00:14:28,176
move.

445
00:14:28,656 --> 00:14:30,966
But content areas are different.

446
00:14:30,966 --> 00:14:32,496
So, they need to maintain high

447
00:14:32,616 --> 00:14:34,856
visual contrast to increase

448
00:14:34,856 --> 00:14:35,636
legibility.

449
00:14:36,676 --> 00:14:38,606
So, if you get started, you

450
00:14:38,606 --> 00:14:41,536
should ask yourself is your app

451
00:14:41,536 --> 00:14:41,986
legible?

452
00:14:43,186 --> 00:14:45,296
Because maximizing legibility is

453
00:14:45,296 --> 00:14:47,016
the highest benefit on being

454
00:14:47,016 --> 00:14:49,146
able to comprehend information

455
00:14:49,436 --> 00:14:51,416
because it's less work on us to

456
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:51,986
interpret.

457
00:14:53,266 --> 00:14:55,106
For example, when we have key

458
00:14:55,106 --> 00:14:56,996
information that is low in

459
00:14:57,046 --> 00:14:59,946
contrasts because of small fonts

460
00:15:00,356 --> 00:15:02,506
and low color contrast ratios,

461
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:04,376
or thin fonts.

462
00:15:05,956 --> 00:15:08,356
It may be painful to read and

463
00:15:08,356 --> 00:15:10,206
you experience cognitive strain.

464
00:15:10,806 --> 00:15:13,866
So, a good place to start to

465
00:15:13,866 --> 00:15:15,856
correct low contrast is to use

466
00:15:15,856 --> 00:15:18,966
the default textile body for

467
00:15:18,966 --> 00:15:20,496
your main content and a high

468
00:15:20,496 --> 00:15:22,346
color contrast with your

469
00:15:22,346 --> 00:15:22,936
background.

470
00:15:23,776 --> 00:15:25,716
And then you can use bolder font

471
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:28,976
weights to emphasize text or

472
00:15:28,976 --> 00:15:30,826
titles, rather than thin fonts.

473
00:15:31,756 --> 00:15:33,516
And you can use filled in button

474
00:15:33,516 --> 00:15:36,076
shapes so that the text contrast

475
00:15:36,076 --> 00:15:38,646
is high, and the way forward in

476
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:40,126
your app is really clear.

477
00:15:40,776 --> 00:15:43,866
And if you don't use textiles or

478
00:15:43,866 --> 00:15:45,606
system fonts in your app, it

479
00:15:45,606 --> 00:15:47,316
would be ideal to support the

480
00:15:47,316 --> 00:15:49,216
accessibility bold text

481
00:15:49,216 --> 00:15:51,356
settings, which requires you to

482
00:15:51,356 --> 00:15:53,156
increase your font weights by

483
00:15:53,156 --> 00:15:54,686
two weights thicker when the

484
00:15:54,686 --> 00:15:55,446
setting is on.

485
00:15:56,006 --> 00:15:57,256
Now, this is built-in with

486
00:15:57,366 --> 00:15:58,636
system fonts and textiles.

487
00:16:00,086 --> 00:16:02,616
The new App Store design does an

488
00:16:02,616 --> 00:16:04,146
excellent job at maximizing

489
00:16:04,146 --> 00:16:05,496
legibility through its bold

490
00:16:05,496 --> 00:16:07,296
typography, prominent buy

491
00:16:07,296 --> 00:16:10,566
buttons, large fonts, and high

492
00:16:10,966 --> 00:16:12,586
color contrast colors.

493
00:16:13,086 --> 00:16:13,946
Great job guys.

494
00:16:14,596 --> 00:16:19,406
On macOS, there are increased

495
00:16:19,406 --> 00:16:21,786
contrast settings as well, that

496
00:16:21,786 --> 00:16:24,586
when on all active controls

497
00:16:24,866 --> 00:16:27,506
become higher contrast by making

498
00:16:27,506 --> 00:16:29,896
backgrounds opaque, button

499
00:16:29,896 --> 00:16:31,716
outlines becomes thicker and

500
00:16:31,716 --> 00:16:35,696
darker and system colors become

501
00:16:35,696 --> 00:16:37,576
darker to create high color

502
00:16:37,576 --> 00:16:38,706
contrast ratios.

503
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:40,646
So now that you know to look

504
00:16:40,646 --> 00:16:42,176
for, let's look at the before

505
00:16:42,176 --> 00:16:42,996
and after again.

506
00:16:44,106 --> 00:16:44,666
Before.

507
00:16:45,996 --> 00:16:46,766
After.

508
00:16:47,876 --> 00:16:50,206
And even the ruled lines and the

509
00:16:50,206 --> 00:16:52,176
color values of gray text

510
00:16:52,176 --> 00:16:53,016
becomes darker.

511
00:16:54,106 --> 00:16:55,726
You will need to supply these

512
00:16:55,766 --> 00:16:57,316
same alternate designs, if you

513
00:16:57,316 --> 00:16:58,876
do not use standard AppKit

514
00:16:59,066 --> 00:17:00,176
because they will not come for

515
00:16:59,066 --> 00:17:00,176
because they will not come for

516
00:17:00,176 --> 00:17:02,126
free in custom UI, but they're

517
00:17:02,126 --> 00:17:03,726
extremely important for

518
00:17:03,726 --> 00:17:04,915
maximizing legibility.

519
00:17:04,915 --> 00:17:08,576
Now, the next suggestion to

520
00:17:08,576 --> 00:17:09,945
increase legibility maybe the

521
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:11,326
most important thing to take

522
00:17:11,326 --> 00:17:11,906
away today.

523
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:14,376
And that's to support dynamic

524
00:17:14,376 --> 00:17:16,136
type, or the text size setting

525
00:17:17,096 --> 00:17:18,756
because this feature increases

526
00:17:18,756 --> 00:17:20,296
legibility by allowing each

527
00:17:20,296 --> 00:17:22,175
person to personalize their

528
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:23,486
experience by increasing the

529
00:17:23,486 --> 00:17:24,175
font size.

530
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:26,646
Or, maybe you need a farther

531
00:17:26,646 --> 00:17:28,966
viewing distance if mounted on a

532
00:17:29,146 --> 00:17:30,616
chair or propped on a table.

533
00:17:32,766 --> 00:17:34,016
Because when our fonts don't

534
00:17:34,116 --> 00:17:35,976
scale, people with low vision

535
00:17:35,976 --> 00:17:37,576
need to use screen zoom windows

536
00:17:37,576 --> 00:17:38,866
to read the content.

537
00:17:39,556 --> 00:17:41,286
That's like having to turn your

538
00:17:41,286 --> 00:17:43,126
light on, or your magnifier in a

539
00:17:43,126 --> 00:17:45,066
dimly lit restaurant to read the

540
00:17:45,066 --> 00:17:45,566
menu.

541
00:17:45,806 --> 00:17:47,946
But except this is all day and

542
00:17:47,946 --> 00:17:48,456
every day.

543
00:17:48,456 --> 00:17:51,366
And some people don't bother

544
00:17:51,366 --> 00:17:52,516
with zoom windows at all.

545
00:17:52,956 --> 00:17:54,296
They painfully read the small

546
00:17:54,296 --> 00:17:56,086
type or use their phones for

547
00:17:56,086 --> 00:17:57,276
short periods of time.

548
00:17:57,536 --> 00:17:58,406
And that's not a great

549
00:17:58,406 --> 00:17:59,036
experience.

550
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:02,356
So, if you adopt dynamic type by

551
00:18:02,356 --> 00:18:04,486
using textiles and use the new

552
00:18:04,526 --> 00:18:07,216
standard spacing constraints, we

553
00:18:07,216 --> 00:18:08,596
can offer a larger reading

554
00:18:08,596 --> 00:18:09,986
experience without needing zoom

555
00:18:09,986 --> 00:18:10,416
windows.

556
00:18:11,336 --> 00:18:13,476
And new this year in iOS 11 is

557
00:18:13,476 --> 00:18:15,116
dynamic type support for custom

558
00:18:15,116 --> 00:18:15,536
fonts.

559
00:18:17,516 --> 00:18:19,276
Additionally, if you access

560
00:18:19,366 --> 00:18:20,676
larger text setting via the

561
00:18:20,676 --> 00:18:22,236
general settings, there's a

562
00:18:22,236 --> 00:18:24,916
switch that enables even larger

563
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:26,586
accessibility text sizes.

564
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:29,586
And this year, in iOS 11, all

565
00:18:29,586 --> 00:18:31,116
textiles will support these

566
00:18:31,116 --> 00:18:31,906
larger settings.

567
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:34,306
So, this means that we need to

568
00:18:34,306 --> 00:18:35,986
design responsive layouts to be

569
00:18:35,986 --> 00:18:37,376
able to handle these large font

570
00:18:37,376 --> 00:18:37,816
sizes.

571
00:18:38,896 --> 00:18:40,806
To do this for our own platform

572
00:18:40,966 --> 00:18:42,456
apps this year, a team of us

573
00:18:42,456 --> 00:18:44,066
took a step back and developed a

574
00:18:44,066 --> 00:18:45,916
few simple principles that

575
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,216
helped guide us through a

576
00:18:47,216 --> 00:18:48,246
system-wide audit.

577
00:18:49,556 --> 00:18:51,746
The first principle was to make

578
00:18:51,746 --> 00:18:53,876
as much text dynamic as possible

579
00:18:53,876 --> 00:18:54,836
and to support these

580
00:18:54,836 --> 00:18:56,296
accessibility text sizes.

581
00:18:57,646 --> 00:19:00,386
Next is make good use of the

582
00:18:57,646 --> 00:19:00,386
Next is make good use of the

583
00:19:00,386 --> 00:19:02,436
screen width by wrapping lines

584
00:19:02,436 --> 00:19:04,186
of type, rather than truncating.

585
00:19:05,406 --> 00:19:07,316
And then, displaying the same

586
00:19:07,316 --> 00:19:09,156
amount of text at the larger

587
00:19:09,156 --> 00:19:11,066
sizes as with the default UI.

588
00:19:12,456 --> 00:19:14,336
And lastly, scaling glyphs that

589
00:19:14,336 --> 00:19:16,126
appear next to text in content

590
00:19:16,126 --> 00:19:17,476
areas so that the glyphs scale

591
00:19:17,476 --> 00:19:18,926
with the text in harmony.

592
00:19:19,516 --> 00:19:21,486
And when we look at all of these

593
00:19:21,486 --> 00:19:23,156
together in practice it really

594
00:19:23,156 --> 00:19:23,916
gets magical.

595
00:19:24,776 --> 00:19:27,106
The mail screen now grows the

596
00:19:27,106 --> 00:19:29,206
whole mail message to a zoom

597
00:19:29,206 --> 00:19:31,926
level of 315% from the default

598
00:19:31,926 --> 00:19:32,366
size.

599
00:19:33,456 --> 00:19:35,056
And in custom layouts, like

600
00:19:35,056 --> 00:19:37,056
calendar, this year we made even

601
00:19:37,056 --> 00:19:38,716
more content scale like the

602
00:19:38,716 --> 00:19:40,596
month grid increase in size,

603
00:19:41,106 --> 00:19:42,286
where it didn't support dynamic

604
00:19:42,286 --> 00:19:43,216
type it all before.

605
00:19:43,216 --> 00:19:45,826
And at the larger accessibility

606
00:19:45,826 --> 00:19:48,126
sizes, we re-laid out the event

607
00:19:48,286 --> 00:19:50,786
row similar to the watch layout.

608
00:19:51,156 --> 00:19:52,466
Because in the end, the

609
00:19:52,466 --> 00:19:54,056
character count per line was

610
00:19:54,056 --> 00:19:54,916
about the same.

611
00:19:54,986 --> 00:19:57,416
And it allowed maximum screen

612
00:19:57,416 --> 00:19:58,356
width for text.

613
00:19:59,046 --> 00:20:01,526
So, now if we turn on the bold

614
00:19:59,046 --> 00:20:01,526
So, now if we turn on the bold

615
00:20:01,526 --> 00:20:04,256
text setting and simulate low

616
00:20:04,256 --> 00:20:05,836
vision with the blur, and

617
00:20:06,866 --> 00:20:08,666
compare it next to the largest

618
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:10,236
currently shipping screen on the

619
00:20:10,236 --> 00:20:12,496
left, now people with vision

620
00:20:12,496 --> 00:20:14,016
loss will be able to use this

621
00:20:14,016 --> 00:20:14,386
app more.

622
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:16,726
Thanks.

623
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:21,766
[ Applause ]

624
00:20:22,266 --> 00:20:23,526
We've designed these responsive

625
00:20:23,526 --> 00:20:25,736
layouts in most native UIKit

626
00:20:25,736 --> 00:20:26,426
controls.

627
00:20:26,626 --> 00:20:28,356
For example, like action sheets,

628
00:20:29,226 --> 00:20:31,286
edit menus, and a keyboard auto

629
00:20:31,286 --> 00:20:32,046
correction bar.

630
00:20:33,386 --> 00:20:34,736
For elements like navigation

631
00:20:34,736 --> 00:20:36,386
bars, toolbars, and tab bars

632
00:20:36,756 --> 00:20:37,796
that would take up too much

633
00:20:37,796 --> 00:20:39,016
space if we scaled them.

634
00:20:39,346 --> 00:20:41,086
We added a larger representation

635
00:20:41,086 --> 00:20:42,776
of the Fortis in a central hub

636
00:20:42,886 --> 00:20:44,616
that you can get via Long Press.

637
00:20:45,936 --> 00:20:47,556
And we also added larger

638
00:20:47,556 --> 00:20:49,796
popovers for segmented controls.

639
00:20:50,446 --> 00:20:53,266
And we've also extended larger

640
00:20:53,266 --> 00:20:55,026
tech support to system spaces

641
00:20:55,026 --> 00:20:58,506
like home screen app labels, and

642
00:20:58,506 --> 00:20:59,256
notifications.

643
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:01,696
Now, there are a few we missed

644
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:01,696
Now, there are a few we missed

645
00:21:01,696 --> 00:21:03,736
this year, but we have plans for

646
00:21:03,736 --> 00:21:06,086
more and if you support iKit,

647
00:21:06,086 --> 00:21:07,216
you will get these updates for

648
00:21:07,216 --> 00:21:08,466
free as we make them.

649
00:21:09,086 --> 00:21:12,236
So, maximizing legibility and

650
00:21:12,236 --> 00:21:14,086
providing scalable dynamic type

651
00:21:14,086 --> 00:21:16,246
improves visual experience for

652
00:21:16,246 --> 00:21:16,756
everyone.

653
00:21:18,076 --> 00:21:19,936
And alongside text that is clear

654
00:21:19,936 --> 00:21:22,186
and understandable, same applies

655
00:21:22,186 --> 00:21:23,576
for media and games.

656
00:21:24,546 --> 00:21:26,516
All dialogue should support

657
00:21:26,516 --> 00:21:28,636
captions because captions

658
00:21:28,636 --> 00:21:30,286
display what is being spoken,

659
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:31,706
which gives more access to

660
00:21:31,706 --> 00:21:33,126
people, whether you have hearing

661
00:21:33,126 --> 00:21:35,006
loss, in a public setting, or

662
00:21:35,006 --> 00:21:35,986
maybe even learning a new

663
00:21:35,986 --> 00:21:36,516
language.

664
00:21:37,466 --> 00:21:39,076
It's like trying to watch a

665
00:21:39,076 --> 00:21:40,926
video or a game intro with the

666
00:21:40,926 --> 00:21:42,456
volume turned all the way down,

667
00:21:42,906 --> 00:21:45,576
or trying to read someone's lips

668
00:21:45,576 --> 00:21:46,756
that aren't looking at you.

669
00:21:46,956 --> 00:21:49,446
It feels like you only get about

670
00:21:49,446 --> 00:21:50,326
half the story.

671
00:21:51,806 --> 00:21:53,986
So, apps like Kitchen Stories

672
00:21:53,986 --> 00:21:55,626
have added captions to all of

673
00:21:55,626 --> 00:21:57,736
their cooking videos, which is

674
00:21:58,436 --> 00:21:58,556
great.

675
00:21:59,076 --> 00:22:01,616
OK so along with sight is sound.

676
00:21:59,076 --> 00:22:01,616
OK so along with sight is sound.

677
00:22:03,246 --> 00:22:04,626
You can ask yourself, are your

678
00:22:04,626 --> 00:22:05,636
apps audible?

679
00:22:06,806 --> 00:22:08,856
So, let's listen to a clip of

680
00:22:08,856 --> 00:22:10,896
the intro design for Carlos V.

681
00:22:10,896 --> 00:22:13,426
video again and listen to the

682
00:22:13,426 --> 00:22:15,096
significance of the audible cues

683
00:22:15,096 --> 00:22:17,646
of the app along with VoiceOver

684
00:22:17,646 --> 00:22:19,326
that he's using to navigate.

685
00:22:20,086 --> 00:22:21,756
Now, VoiceOver is a built-in

686
00:22:21,756 --> 00:22:23,756
screen reader that speaks the

687
00:22:23,756 --> 00:22:25,446
content on screen for people who

688
00:22:25,446 --> 00:22:27,246
may be blind or have low vision.

689
00:22:29,486 --> 00:22:30,536

696
00:22:42,776 --> 00:22:45,616
Follow our ReverbNation page.

697
00:22:46,576 --> 00:22:48,846
&gt;&gt; Done. Successfully shared.

698
00:22:50,526 --> 00:22:53,016
&gt;&gt; So, we can hear VoiceOver

699
00:22:53,016 --> 00:22:54,586
navigating the app.

700
00:22:54,586 --> 00:22:56,346
The custom sounds of the apps

701
00:22:56,346 --> 00:22:58,986
messaging feature, and dictation

702
00:22:58,986 --> 00:23:00,266
to input the message.

703
00:22:58,986 --> 00:23:00,266
to input the message.

704
00:23:00,926 --> 00:23:02,576
Altogether, this creates an

705
00:23:02,576 --> 00:23:04,596
experience that is accessible to

706
00:23:04,596 --> 00:23:05,146
Carlos.

707
00:23:06,246 --> 00:23:08,406
So, adding thoughtful sounds to

708
00:23:08,406 --> 00:23:10,866
app interactions helps you know

709
00:23:10,866 --> 00:23:13,086
where you are, what you've done,

710
00:23:13,126 --> 00:23:14,276
what you can do.

711
00:23:14,526 --> 00:23:15,606
Plus, it's just delightful.

712
00:23:17,516 --> 00:23:19,796
So, checking out VoiceOver in a

713
00:23:19,796 --> 00:23:22,546
system is as easy as asking Siri

714
00:23:22,576 --> 00:23:24,286
to turn VoiceOver on and off.

715
00:23:25,156 --> 00:23:26,316
But if you don't know the

716
00:23:26,316 --> 00:23:27,966
VoiceOver's like I have a quick

717
00:23:27,966 --> 00:23:28,486
demo here.

718
00:23:29,036 --> 00:23:30,486
I'll be swiping across the

719
00:23:30,486 --> 00:23:32,336
screen to advance the selection

720
00:23:32,616 --> 00:23:33,326
through some apps.

721
00:23:33,716 --> 00:23:34,996
But then since I know that the

722
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:36,546
phone app is in my dock, I'm

723
00:23:36,586 --> 00:23:37,996
going to tap the lower left hand

724
00:23:37,996 --> 00:23:39,376
corner of the screen and then

725
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:41,946
double tap to open.

726
00:23:41,946 --> 00:23:42,756
&gt;&gt; VoiceOver on.

727
00:23:42,846 --> 00:23:44,506
Mail. No unread emails.

728
00:23:44,846 --> 00:23:46,946
Calendar. Monday, June 5.

729
00:23:47,486 --> 00:23:49,046
Photos. Camera.

730
00:23:50,006 --> 00:23:51,466
Dock. Phone.

731
00:23:53,606 --> 00:23:54,816
Phone. Add.

732
00:23:54,816 --> 00:23:55,476
Favorites.

733
00:23:56,326 --> 00:23:58,086
Edit button.

734
00:23:58,086 --> 00:23:59,816
Amy Frost iPhone button.

735
00:24:01,166 --> 00:24:02,846
&gt;&gt; So, and there are tutorials

736
00:24:02,846 --> 00:24:04,406
and documentation on Apple's

737
00:24:04,406 --> 00:24:05,906
developer site to help you

738
00:24:05,906 --> 00:24:07,436
become even more familiar and to

739
00:24:07,436 --> 00:24:08,726
be able to support this in your

740
00:24:08,726 --> 00:24:09,000
apps.

741
00:24:11,356 --> 00:24:12,316
Additionally, if you have

742
00:24:12,316 --> 00:24:13,926
image-based apps, we need to

743
00:24:13,926 --> 00:24:15,786
allow image descriptions to be

744
00:24:15,786 --> 00:24:17,586
added at share time by the

745
00:24:17,586 --> 00:24:19,646
poster so that VoiceOver can

746
00:24:19,646 --> 00:24:21,556
have something personalized to

747
00:24:21,556 --> 00:24:23,026
describe the photo with.

748
00:24:23,546 --> 00:24:25,406
Otherwise, new in VoiceOver this

749
00:24:25,406 --> 00:24:27,586
year is image analysis to

750
00:24:27,586 --> 00:24:29,056
describe the image contents or

751
00:24:29,056 --> 00:24:30,626
composition, or if type is

752
00:24:30,626 --> 00:24:31,836
overlaid on images.

753
00:24:32,316 --> 00:24:35,136
But a handcrafted description

754
00:24:35,136 --> 00:24:36,296
will always be preferred.

755
00:24:37,016 --> 00:24:38,736
Twitter has done a great job at

756
00:24:38,736 --> 00:24:40,406
adding image description options

757
00:24:40,406 --> 00:24:41,376
to their Tweet sheets.

758
00:24:42,676 --> 00:24:45,156
So, another area that reduces

759
00:24:45,156 --> 00:24:47,996
hurdles and barriers for apps is

760
00:24:48,366 --> 00:24:49,846
integrating with Siri.

761
00:24:50,046 --> 00:24:51,886
Siri is the ultimate quick

762
00:24:51,886 --> 00:24:54,466
access to your app that doesn't

763
00:24:54,466 --> 00:24:56,806
even require looking or holding,

764
00:24:56,806 --> 00:24:58,106
or touching the screen, with

765
00:24:58,106 --> 00:24:59,786
this voice activation and speech

766
00:24:59,786 --> 00:25:00,166
input.

767
00:24:59,786 --> 00:25:00,166
input.

768
00:25:00,786 --> 00:25:02,796
It's hands-free and eyes free.

769
00:25:03,116 --> 00:25:04,926
I can control my home, send

770
00:25:04,926 --> 00:25:06,526
messages, and even start

771
00:25:06,526 --> 00:25:08,086
workouts quickly with apps like

772
00:25:08,086 --> 00:25:08,516
Zova.

773
00:25:09,656 --> 00:25:12,486
And also, new this year is being

774
00:25:12,486 --> 00:25:14,336
able to type to Siri that is

775
00:25:14,336 --> 00:25:16,246
available in accessibility

776
00:25:16,246 --> 00:25:16,646
settings.

777
00:25:17,106 --> 00:25:18,816
This gives quick access to

778
00:25:18,816 --> 00:25:19,806
someone who may not be able to

779
00:25:19,806 --> 00:25:20,316
speak.

780
00:25:20,386 --> 00:25:21,896
Or maybe you're just in a public

781
00:25:21,896 --> 00:25:22,336
setting.

782
00:25:22,986 --> 00:25:26,716
So, lastly, along with sight and

783
00:25:26,716 --> 00:25:28,156
sound, is touch.

784
00:25:28,716 --> 00:25:31,026
You can ask yourself, are your

785
00:25:31,026 --> 00:25:32,076
apps tactile?

786
00:25:32,856 --> 00:25:34,366
On supported devices adding

787
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:36,126
haptics provides a way to

788
00:25:36,206 --> 00:25:37,936
physically engage people through

789
00:25:37,936 --> 00:25:38,456
feel.

790
00:25:38,456 --> 00:25:41,036
It gets your attention if sight

791
00:25:41,036 --> 00:25:42,366
and sound are not an option.

792
00:25:42,716 --> 00:25:44,236
But also, provides an

793
00:25:44,306 --> 00:25:45,676
enhancement for everyone.

794
00:25:46,686 --> 00:25:48,876
For example, some

795
00:25:48,876 --> 00:25:50,706
system-provided interface

796
00:25:50,706 --> 00:25:52,056
elements such as switches,

797
00:25:52,056 --> 00:25:54,036
sliders, pickers, index

798
00:25:54,036 --> 00:25:55,936
scrubbers provide haptic

799
00:25:55,936 --> 00:25:57,166
feedback when we interact with

800
00:25:57,166 --> 00:25:59,196
them to reinforce the action

801
00:25:59,356 --> 00:26:00,046
that we're doing.

802
00:25:59,356 --> 00:26:00,046
that we're doing.

803
00:26:01,286 --> 00:26:06,726
And a haptic on pull to refresh,

804
00:26:07,106 --> 00:26:08,316
let's you know that you've

805
00:26:08,516 --> 00:26:10,356
reached the critical threshold

806
00:26:10,626 --> 00:26:12,606
between scrolling and refreshing

807
00:26:12,866 --> 00:26:14,256
that shares a continuous

808
00:26:14,256 --> 00:26:14,736
gesture.

809
00:26:16,086 --> 00:26:20,466
And likewise, with swipe to

810
00:26:20,466 --> 00:26:20,916
delete.

811
00:26:21,296 --> 00:26:22,856
The haptic provides the critical

812
00:26:22,856 --> 00:26:24,876
threshold of the accelerated

813
00:26:24,876 --> 00:26:27,076
delete swipe.

814
00:26:27,546 --> 00:26:31,136
And then another example is

815
00:26:31,136 --> 00:26:31,746
Siri.

816
00:26:31,746 --> 00:26:34,356
It uses a success haptic as a

817
00:26:34,356 --> 00:26:35,906
confirmation that she heard what

818
00:26:35,906 --> 00:26:36,416
you said.

819
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:44,886
Or Apple Pay uses visuals

820
00:26:44,886 --> 00:26:46,876
haptics and sound with the

821
00:26:46,876 --> 00:26:49,756
confirmation for the successful

822
00:26:49,756 --> 00:26:50,266
purchase.

823
00:26:50,846 --> 00:26:52,406
It feels the way it looks and

824
00:26:52,406 --> 00:26:53,716
sounds, leaving me with a

825
00:26:53,716 --> 00:26:59,156
confident purchase or payment

826
00:26:59,156 --> 00:26:59,223
[ding].

827
00:26:59,223 --> 00:27:01,446
Now, that's clear.

828
00:26:59,223 --> 00:27:01,446
Now, that's clear.

829
00:27:02,106 --> 00:27:04,706
So, to see if your apps are

830
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:07,236
perceivable, ask yourself is it

831
00:27:07,236 --> 00:27:07,866
legible?

832
00:27:08,336 --> 00:27:09,556
Can I read it?

833
00:27:09,766 --> 00:27:10,696
Is it audible?

834
00:27:10,696 --> 00:27:12,156
Is it usable without site?

835
00:27:13,056 --> 00:27:14,096
Is it tactile?

836
00:27:14,096 --> 00:27:14,946
Can I feel it?

837
00:27:15,736 --> 00:27:17,386
Take one away, or even two of

838
00:27:17,386 --> 00:27:20,646
these can I still understand it.

839
00:27:21,366 --> 00:27:23,336
And so, now my colleague AJ is

840
00:27:23,336 --> 00:27:24,726
going to talk about what they

841
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:26,366
did in the Maps Team this year,

842
00:27:26,566 --> 00:27:27,896
applying some of these methods.

843
00:27:29,516 --> 00:27:34,496
[ Applause ]

844
00:27:34,996 --> 00:27:37,226
&gt;&gt; Thank you Caroline.

845
00:27:37,576 --> 00:27:38,316
Good morning, everyone.

846
00:27:39,036 --> 00:27:41,856
In Maps we collaborated closely

847
00:27:41,856 --> 00:27:43,096
with Caroline and the platform

848
00:27:43,096 --> 00:27:43,496
team.

849
00:27:43,946 --> 00:27:45,166
And this year we put into

850
00:27:45,166 --> 00:27:46,716
practice a lot of what she's

851
00:27:46,716 --> 00:27:47,206
covered today.

852
00:27:48,036 --> 00:27:50,396
Now, before we get into a few of

853
00:27:50,396 --> 00:27:52,806
those examples, and think about

854
00:27:52,806 --> 00:27:54,416
how to design with integrity,

855
00:27:54,866 --> 00:27:55,976
we're going to take a short

856
00:27:55,976 --> 00:27:56,486
diversion.

857
00:27:56,486 --> 00:27:58,356
It's going to add a couple of

858
00:27:58,356 --> 00:28:03,086
minutes to our ETA.

859
00:27:58,356 --> 00:28:03,086
minutes to our ETA.

860
00:28:03,336 --> 00:28:04,826
We've used maps for thousands of

861
00:28:04,826 --> 00:28:09,206
years to plan, direct, to travel

862
00:28:09,406 --> 00:28:10,966
and to help us explore the

863
00:28:10,966 --> 00:28:11,146
world.

864
00:28:12,486 --> 00:28:14,496
And maps of the past, like this

865
00:28:14,496 --> 00:28:16,856
one, beautiful as they remain,

866
00:28:17,406 --> 00:28:19,376
were not accessible at all.

867
00:28:20,056 --> 00:28:22,386
You can't zoom on this map

868
00:28:22,816 --> 00:28:24,916
without a magnifying glass, and

869
00:28:24,916 --> 00:28:26,076
you couldn't orient yourself

870
00:28:26,076 --> 00:28:29,156
upon it without a compass.

871
00:28:29,716 --> 00:28:32,536
In face the only manipulating

872
00:28:32,536 --> 00:28:34,226
you could do would be to fold

873
00:28:35,036 --> 00:28:35,106
it.

874
00:28:35,756 --> 00:28:37,766
So, as our understanding of the

875
00:28:37,766 --> 00:28:40,086
world has improved, so have our

876
00:28:40,826 --> 00:28:40,956
maps.

877
00:28:43,436 --> 00:28:45,696
Today, your map understands

878
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:46,486
where you are.

879
00:28:47,296 --> 00:28:48,286
It knows the direction you're

880
00:28:48,346 --> 00:28:48,626
facing.

881
00:28:50,006 --> 00:28:50,916
It knows the device you're

882
00:28:50,916 --> 00:28:53,076
using, and it's equipped with

883
00:28:53,076 --> 00:28:54,226
your individual preferences.

884
00:28:55,696 --> 00:28:57,676
It's updated every day with new

885
00:28:57,676 --> 00:28:58,236
information.

886
00:28:58,726 --> 00:28:59,626
And you can search it.

887
00:29:00,836 --> 00:29:02,606
You can mark it indestructibly

888
00:29:02,926 --> 00:29:03,716
and make it your own.

889
00:29:04,496 --> 00:29:07,166
It can take you places in real

890
00:29:07,166 --> 00:29:08,866
time, avoiding traffic,

891
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:10,236
hopefully.

892
00:29:11,286 --> 00:29:13,446
And in iOS 11, you can even see

893
00:29:13,446 --> 00:29:14,286
inside venues.

894
00:29:14,936 --> 00:29:18,966
The point is, today our mediums

895
00:29:19,116 --> 00:29:21,316
are so versatile, they provide

896
00:29:21,316 --> 00:29:22,246
us with the incredible

897
00:29:22,246 --> 00:29:22,866
opportunity.

898
00:29:25,896 --> 00:29:28,336
So, when I joined Maps, I

899
00:29:28,336 --> 00:29:29,606
remember thinking a lot about

900
00:29:29,606 --> 00:29:32,236
how crazy it felt to see inside.

901
00:29:32,996 --> 00:29:34,386
Like looking through a keyhole

902
00:29:34,956 --> 00:29:37,866
and stepping through this icon,

903
00:29:37,866 --> 00:29:39,526
I cannot have imagined the

904
00:29:39,526 --> 00:29:40,806
operation I saw behind it.

905
00:29:41,546 --> 00:29:43,116
I took it almost completely for

906
00:29:43,116 --> 00:29:43,556
granted.

907
00:29:45,056 --> 00:29:46,646
And everyone who uses our apps

908
00:29:46,646 --> 00:29:47,306
are the same way.

909
00:29:48,456 --> 00:29:49,726
They don't care how hard it was

910
00:29:49,786 --> 00:29:50,176
to build.

911
00:29:51,406 --> 00:29:52,746
It's not important that it works

912
00:29:52,786 --> 00:29:54,846
for Johnny Appleseed or Jane

913
00:29:54,846 --> 00:29:55,086
Doe.

914
00:29:56,466 --> 00:29:57,766
What's important is that it

915
00:29:57,766 --> 00:29:58,576
works for me.

916
00:29:59,886 --> 00:30:00,506
Can I use it?

917
00:29:59,886 --> 00:30:00,506
Can I use it?

918
00:30:02,246 --> 00:30:03,796
Imagine going to the movies.

919
00:30:04,796 --> 00:30:06,016
You bought your ticket and your

920
00:30:06,016 --> 00:30:07,266
excited to watch the film.

921
00:30:08,116 --> 00:30:08,736
The theater's packed.

922
00:30:09,926 --> 00:30:11,526
You get to your seat and there's

923
00:30:11,526 --> 00:30:12,676
a pillar in front of it,

924
00:30:13,236 --> 00:30:14,396
completely blocking your view.

925
00:30:15,676 --> 00:30:16,986
I'm pretty sure I'm not going to

926
00:30:16,986 --> 00:30:17,946
come back to that cinema.

927
00:30:18,526 --> 00:30:21,886
And I'm no longer just a regular

928
00:30:21,886 --> 00:30:23,816
Maps user, not that there's any

929
00:30:23,816 --> 00:30:24,326
such thing.

930
00:30:25,616 --> 00:30:27,516
We're trying to build a map of

931
00:30:27,516 --> 00:30:30,026
the entire world and it's a big

932
00:30:30,026 --> 00:30:32,356
and diverse place.

933
00:30:32,536 --> 00:30:34,286
Like you, I'm on a team

934
00:30:34,286 --> 00:30:36,056
responsible for everyone's

935
00:30:36,056 --> 00:30:36,546
experience.

936
00:30:37,266 --> 00:30:40,766
So, coming back to simplicity

937
00:30:40,866 --> 00:30:41,866
and perceivability.

938
00:30:43,216 --> 00:30:45,396
Maps are not exact replicas of

939
00:30:45,396 --> 00:30:46,026
environments.

940
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:49,176
Sometimes photographic detail is

941
00:30:49,176 --> 00:30:49,636
useful.

942
00:30:50,516 --> 00:30:52,396
But most people don't find the

943
00:30:52,396 --> 00:30:53,976
satellite view practical in

944
00:30:53,976 --> 00:30:55,306
everyday life.

945
00:30:56,516 --> 00:30:59,056
We use simplified abstracted

946
00:30:59,056 --> 00:31:01,366
representations, designed to be

947
00:30:59,056 --> 00:31:01,366
representations, designed to be

948
00:31:01,366 --> 00:31:03,186
easy to understand and faster

949
00:31:03,186 --> 00:31:06,566
for us to process to help us

950
00:31:06,566 --> 00:31:07,936
orient ourselves more quickly.

951
00:31:08,526 --> 00:31:10,456
And it's why we provide a

952
00:31:10,456 --> 00:31:11,356
transit map too.

953
00:31:11,356 --> 00:31:13,946
Where we suppress some elements,

954
00:31:14,456 --> 00:31:16,196
like places or minor roads,

955
00:31:16,586 --> 00:31:17,846
which aren't as relevant to you

956
00:31:18,096 --> 00:31:19,146
once you're using transit.

957
00:31:20,156 --> 00:31:21,256
And we do all this for

958
00:31:21,256 --> 00:31:21,876
simplicity.

959
00:31:22,436 --> 00:31:26,176
And we make sure our maps are

960
00:31:26,176 --> 00:31:26,896
understandable.

961
00:31:27,796 --> 00:31:30,026
Visually, audibly, and through

962
00:31:30,026 --> 00:31:30,886
haptic feedback.

963
00:31:31,756 --> 00:31:33,556
We put a lot of care into

964
00:31:33,556 --> 00:31:34,996
keeping the navigation screen as

965
00:31:35,036 --> 00:31:35,956
simple as possible.

966
00:31:36,496 --> 00:31:37,776
The most important information

967
00:31:37,776 --> 00:31:39,346
available at a glance.

968
00:31:39,396 --> 00:31:41,716
So, you can understand quickly

969
00:31:42,116 --> 00:31:44,146
and stay focused on the road.

970
00:31:44,706 --> 00:31:46,236
And while you're walking or

971
00:31:46,236 --> 00:31:48,136
taking transit, audible

972
00:31:48,136 --> 00:31:50,206
directions spoken clearly.

973
00:31:51,076 --> 00:31:52,396
&gt;&gt; Starting route to San Jose

974
00:31:52,396 --> 00:31:53,756
McEnery Convention Center.

975
00:31:55,076 --> 00:31:56,976
&gt;&gt; Imagine if Siri mumbled these

976
00:31:56,976 --> 00:31:59,106
instructions incomprehensibly.

977
00:32:00,146 --> 00:32:01,526
Because isn't that kind of the

978
00:32:01,526 --> 00:32:03,146
equivalent to small, blurry

979
00:32:03,146 --> 00:32:03,706
information.

980
00:32:04,296 --> 00:32:07,106
And on your wrist, while your

981
00:32:07,106 --> 00:32:07,946
phone is in your pocket,

982
00:32:08,416 --> 00:32:10,736
different tactic sensations to

983
00:32:10,736 --> 00:32:13,366
inform which way to turn and

984
00:32:14,216 --> 00:32:14,336
when.

985
00:32:14,536 --> 00:32:16,336
Altogether for perceivability.

986
00:32:17,156 --> 00:32:18,976
It's legible, audible, and

987
00:32:19,216 --> 00:32:19,546
tactile.

988
00:32:20,016 --> 00:32:23,316
And you can use any one of these

989
00:32:24,586 --> 00:32:24,986
distinctly.

990
00:32:24,986 --> 00:32:26,376
Integrity is something different

991
00:32:26,376 --> 00:32:26,966
conceptually.

992
00:32:27,796 --> 00:32:30,226
We do things for simplicity and

993
00:32:30,226 --> 00:32:31,516
to improve perceivability.

994
00:32:32,276 --> 00:32:34,036
But we do things with integrity.

995
00:32:35,126 --> 00:32:36,676
The state of being whole and

996
00:32:36,676 --> 00:32:37,196
undivided.

997
00:32:39,216 --> 00:32:40,406
When we say someone has

998
00:32:40,406 --> 00:32:42,056
integrity with think of them as

999
00:32:42,056 --> 00:32:44,186
being honest with an admirable

1000
00:32:44,186 --> 00:32:45,026
moral compass.

1001
00:32:45,956 --> 00:32:47,066
So, when we consider that the

1002
00:32:47,066 --> 00:32:48,496
people who need our services the

1003
00:32:48,496 --> 00:32:50,546
most, might be the ones who find

1004
00:32:50,546 --> 00:32:52,846
them the hardest to use, how do

1005
00:32:52,846 --> 00:32:53,876
we design with integrity.

1006
00:32:55,446 --> 00:32:57,536
Well, as designers and

1007
00:32:57,536 --> 00:32:58,316
developers, we take

1008
00:32:58,316 --> 00:32:59,096
responsibility.

1009
00:33:00,446 --> 00:33:03,326
When architects build spaces

1010
00:33:03,326 --> 00:33:05,246
today, they make sure they're

1011
00:33:05,246 --> 00:33:07,356
accessible for everyone because

1012
00:33:07,356 --> 00:33:08,476
it's a human right.

1013
00:33:08,846 --> 00:33:10,586
And when designer draw beautiful

1014
00:33:10,586 --> 00:33:12,826
cars, they still have to adhere

1015
00:33:12,946 --> 00:33:15,506
to regulations created for human

1016
00:33:16,156 --> 00:33:16,316
safety.

1017
00:33:17,176 --> 00:33:18,566
So, when we design digital

1018
00:33:18,566 --> 00:33:20,716
products, we have to hold

1019
00:33:20,716 --> 00:33:21,966
ourselves accountable for their

1020
00:33:21,966 --> 00:33:23,146
accessibility too.

1021
00:33:23,666 --> 00:33:24,646
Because when we don't we're

1022
00:33:24,646 --> 00:33:25,676
deciding who's important.

1023
00:33:26,256 --> 00:33:30,326
Last year for iOS 10, we

1024
00:33:30,326 --> 00:33:31,926
redesigned Maps from the ground

1025
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:32,436
up.

1026
00:33:33,616 --> 00:33:36,196
Making it clearer, simpler, easy

1027
00:33:36,196 --> 00:33:36,816
to use, and faster.

1028
00:33:37,216 --> 00:33:39,466
And it was a big undertaking.

1029
00:33:40,526 --> 00:33:41,456
We opened the door on

1030
00:33:41,536 --> 00:33:43,216
accessibility, but we didn't go

1031
00:33:43,216 --> 00:33:44,266
that far along the corridor.

1032
00:33:44,266 --> 00:33:45,866
It was a busy year.

1033
00:33:47,686 --> 00:33:49,226
But in iOS 11 we did take

1034
00:33:49,226 --> 00:33:51,276
responsibility, and we made it a

1035
00:33:51,326 --> 00:33:54,226
priority, leveraging the new

1036
00:33:54,226 --> 00:33:55,916
UIKit frameworks and following

1037
00:33:55,916 --> 00:33:57,326
the principles that Caroline

1038
00:33:57,326 --> 00:33:59,546
outlined today.

1039
00:33:59,736 --> 00:34:01,316
Making as much text dynamic as

1040
00:33:59,736 --> 00:34:01,316
Making as much text dynamic as

1041
00:34:01,346 --> 00:34:03,776
possible, displaying the same

1042
00:34:03,776 --> 00:34:05,366
amount of text as the default

1043
00:34:05,366 --> 00:34:09,226
UI, using as much of the screen

1044
00:34:09,226 --> 00:34:11,696
width for text.

1045
00:34:11,696 --> 00:34:12,746
Search is a core component of

1046
00:34:12,746 --> 00:34:14,795
Maps and now it's easier for

1047
00:34:14,795 --> 00:34:15,476
everyone to use.

1048
00:34:16,106 --> 00:34:18,485
But it's not always just as

1049
00:34:18,516 --> 00:34:20,096
simple as increasing the font

1050
00:34:20,096 --> 00:34:20,315
size.

1051
00:34:21,106 --> 00:34:22,216
And you might be thinking, hang

1052
00:34:22,216 --> 00:34:24,166
on, I can see some truncation in

1053
00:34:24,166 --> 00:34:24,876
these screenshots.

1054
00:34:25,676 --> 00:34:26,846
This breaks the principles we're

1055
00:34:26,846 --> 00:34:28,466
talking about, and you're right.

1056
00:34:29,206 --> 00:34:30,456
But sometimes we have to make

1057
00:34:30,456 --> 00:34:32,126
choices based on context.

1058
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:34,525
Like, on the right screen here

1059
00:34:34,525 --> 00:34:36,036
the top of the card has a fixed

1060
00:34:36,036 --> 00:34:36,315
header.

1061
00:34:37,036 --> 00:34:38,565
So, if we didn't truncate, the

1062
00:34:38,565 --> 00:34:40,295
route options beneath would not

1063
00:34:40,295 --> 00:34:40,906
be scrollable.

1064
00:34:41,666 --> 00:34:45,906
Now, this is the card for a

1065
00:34:45,906 --> 00:34:46,176
place.

1066
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:47,806
They're used in different

1067
00:34:47,806 --> 00:34:50,516
context across iOS, including

1068
00:34:50,766 --> 00:34:53,045
Spotlight, Safari, and Siri.

1069
00:34:53,706 --> 00:34:55,376
And from here you start

1070
00:34:55,376 --> 00:34:58,106
navigation, make a call to check

1071
00:34:58,106 --> 00:34:58,996
on your reservation.

1072
00:34:59,926 --> 00:35:00,986
Or even have a look at what's

1073
00:34:59,926 --> 00:35:00,986
Or even have a look at what's

1074
00:35:00,986 --> 00:35:01,396
inside.

1075
00:35:02,156 --> 00:35:03,546
Things everyone might like to

1076
00:35:03,546 --> 00:35:03,660
do.

1077
00:35:05,136 --> 00:35:07,196
So, let's take a closer look at

1078
00:35:07,196 --> 00:35:08,306
some of the components of this

1079
00:35:08,386 --> 00:35:10,576
design, like the title block.

1080
00:35:10,576 --> 00:35:15,436
We use this with search results

1081
00:35:15,436 --> 00:35:18,106
too and last year we truncated

1082
00:35:18,106 --> 00:35:20,226
the title for long place names

1083
00:35:20,566 --> 00:35:21,436
instead of wrapping.

1084
00:35:22,556 --> 00:35:24,206
But with a big of UIKit magic,

1085
00:35:24,376 --> 00:35:28,336
this year, now it does this.

1086
00:35:28,546 --> 00:35:29,556
Which is actually pretty cool.

1087
00:35:29,556 --> 00:35:32,386
And the component is more

1088
00:35:32,386 --> 00:35:34,226
effective and robust because of

1089
00:35:34,856 --> 00:35:35,000
it.

1090
00:35:36,046 --> 00:35:37,126
And we made some changes to the

1091
00:35:37,126 --> 00:35:38,516
place card this year to improve

1092
00:35:38,516 --> 00:35:40,336
hierarchy including this

1093
00:35:40,336 --> 00:35:41,836
secondary row of actions.

1094
00:35:41,836 --> 00:35:44,336
And we need to accommodate a

1095
00:35:44,336 --> 00:35:45,996
maximum of five options here.

1096
00:35:47,006 --> 00:35:47,466
Like these.

1097
00:35:47,966 --> 00:35:50,196
So, on an iPhone 7, in English,

1098
00:35:51,646 --> 00:35:52,146
hang on a sec.

1099
00:35:53,736 --> 00:35:57,116
That was such a cheap joke.

1100
00:35:57,536 --> 00:36:00,686
On iPhone 7, in English this

1101
00:35:57,536 --> 00:36:00,686
On iPhone 7, in English this

1102
00:36:00,686 --> 00:36:02,336
works and we can fit five in a

1103
00:36:02,336 --> 00:36:02,403
row.

1104
00:36:02,403 --> 00:36:04,396
But how do we handle it with

1105
00:36:04,396 --> 00:36:05,056
dynamic type?

1106
00:36:05,266 --> 00:36:06,376
Because we can't just increase

1107
00:36:06,436 --> 00:36:07,106
the font size.

1108
00:36:07,246 --> 00:36:10,826
But we could stack the UI

1109
00:36:10,826 --> 00:36:12,006
elements smartly.

1110
00:36:12,006 --> 00:36:16,726
And all the way up the scale.

1111
00:36:17,416 --> 00:36:18,946
Internationalization is a form

1112
00:36:19,116 --> 00:36:20,186
of accessibility too.

1113
00:36:20,576 --> 00:36:21,366
And it brings its own

1114
00:36:21,366 --> 00:36:21,876
challenges.

1115
00:36:22,566 --> 00:36:23,986
So, how about these labels in

1116
00:36:23,986 --> 00:36:24,396
Italian.

1117
00:36:25,136 --> 00:36:27,716
OK, they're a bit longer.

1118
00:36:27,716 --> 00:36:31,036
So, if we go back down to

1119
00:36:31,876 --> 00:36:34,076
default size, oh, but the label

1120
00:36:34,076 --> 00:36:34,776
is truncating.

1121
00:36:34,866 --> 00:36:37,106
And the label is important.

1122
00:36:37,756 --> 00:36:39,446
We should try not to truncate it

1123
00:36:39,446 --> 00:36:40,026
at any size.

1124
00:36:40,026 --> 00:36:42,396
But we could apply a similar

1125
00:36:42,396 --> 00:36:45,256
technique like this.

1126
00:36:45,956 --> 00:36:48,126
And now, they remain clear and

1127
00:36:48,126 --> 00:36:48,796
uncompromised.

1128
00:36:50,276 --> 00:36:52,396
Adaptive design based on a

1129
00:36:52,396 --> 00:36:54,466
user's language and UI settings.

1130
00:36:55,186 --> 00:36:57,636
And now it works better across

1131
00:36:57,706 --> 00:36:58,956
different device sizes too.

1132
00:37:02,146 --> 00:37:03,256
And for these actions at the

1133
00:37:03,256 --> 00:37:05,166
bottom of the card, as well as

1134
00:37:05,166 --> 00:37:08,286
all of the content, we reflowed

1135
00:37:08,286 --> 00:37:13,276
the labels and scaled the icons.

1136
00:37:13,416 --> 00:37:15,206
Using vector assets, so there's

1137
00:37:15,206 --> 00:37:15,976
no pixilation.

1138
00:37:15,976 --> 00:37:18,326
And of course, we made all the

1139
00:37:18,326 --> 00:37:19,576
labels VoiceOver enabled.

1140
00:37:20,116 --> 00:37:21,586
And in Maps, we hung out with

1141
00:37:21,586 --> 00:37:22,186
Siri as well.

1142
00:37:22,806 --> 00:37:26,086
So, there are more complex

1143
00:37:26,086 --> 00:37:27,226
challenges than the ones I just

1144
00:37:27,226 --> 00:37:27,806
illustrated.

1145
00:37:28,626 --> 00:37:30,176
And it's easier not to take

1146
00:37:30,176 --> 00:37:30,926
responsibility.

1147
00:37:32,386 --> 00:37:33,766
But challenges are rewarding.

1148
00:37:34,776 --> 00:37:37,726
And that's how I ended up;

1149
00:37:38,006 --> 00:37:39,916
challenges are fun and

1150
00:37:39,916 --> 00:37:40,556
rewarding.

1151
00:37:40,556 --> 00:37:41,456
And that's why I ended up

1152
00:37:41,456 --> 00:37:42,996
standing here today.

1153
00:37:43,326 --> 00:37:44,426
Designing for everyone is a

1154
00:37:44,426 --> 00:37:46,336
process that can bring a deeper

1155
00:37:46,336 --> 00:37:49,056
understanding of your product

1156
00:37:49,706 --> 00:37:52,986
and its purpose.

1157
00:37:53,146 --> 00:37:54,796
One of the few effective keys to

1158
00:37:54,796 --> 00:37:55,716
the design problem.

1159
00:37:56,886 --> 00:37:58,616
The ability of the designer to

1160
00:37:58,616 --> 00:37:59,886
recognize as many of the

1161
00:37:59,886 --> 00:38:02,416
constraints possible, their

1162
00:37:59,886 --> 00:38:02,416
constraints possible, their

1163
00:38:02,416 --> 00:38:04,096
willingness and enthusiasm for

1164
00:38:04,336 --> 00:38:05,156
working within these

1165
00:38:05,156 --> 00:38:05,736
constraints.

1166
00:38:06,186 --> 00:38:09,496
Because out of constraints come

1167
00:38:09,496 --> 00:38:10,336
great solutions.

1168
00:38:10,856 --> 00:38:11,976
And if we're designing just for

1169
00:38:11,976 --> 00:38:14,156
default settings, we're not

1170
00:38:14,156 --> 00:38:14,906
doing it right.

1171
00:38:16,186 --> 00:38:17,266
By trying to do better than

1172
00:38:17,266 --> 00:38:19,226
that, we make ourselves better.

1173
00:38:20,036 --> 00:38:21,696
And we really learned an awful

1174
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:22,000
lot this year.

1175
00:38:24,076 --> 00:38:26,686
So, secondly after we decide to

1176
00:38:26,686 --> 00:38:29,426
take responsibility, we need to

1177
00:38:29,426 --> 00:38:30,356
think about empathy.

1178
00:38:31,356 --> 00:38:32,796
The ability to understand

1179
00:38:32,796 --> 00:38:33,066
people.

1180
00:38:34,116 --> 00:38:35,746
To recognize their wants,

1181
00:38:36,116 --> 00:38:37,566
desires, and feelings.

1182
00:38:38,776 --> 00:38:40,456
People that are not you --

1183
00:38:41,286 --> 00:38:43,266
because nobody else is.

1184
00:38:43,336 --> 00:38:45,956
So, let's take a look at a few

1185
00:38:45,956 --> 00:38:48,396
made-up examples that might be

1186
00:38:48,396 --> 00:38:51,396
closer to home.

1187
00:38:51,616 --> 00:38:52,196
Newspapers.

1188
00:38:53,256 --> 00:38:54,616
Never been accessible.

1189
00:38:56,506 --> 00:38:57,306
There's something nice to

1190
00:38:57,306 --> 00:38:58,456
sitting down with a newspaper,

1191
00:38:58,456 --> 00:39:01,606
but not if you can't read it.

1192
00:38:58,456 --> 00:39:01,606
but not if you can't read it.

1193
00:39:02,736 --> 00:39:04,686
If your vision isn't perfect,

1194
00:39:04,686 --> 00:39:06,296
reading one of these has always

1195
00:39:06,296 --> 00:39:06,916
been a challenge.

1196
00:39:08,076 --> 00:39:09,116
And a lot of you create

1197
00:39:09,116 --> 00:39:10,386
platforms for content that's

1198
00:39:10,386 --> 00:39:12,746
consumed the world over.

1199
00:39:13,796 --> 00:39:15,816
Platforms with the capabilities

1200
00:39:16,886 --> 00:39:18,296
to improve the readability of

1201
00:39:18,296 --> 00:39:20,626
our content, relatively and

1202
00:39:20,626 --> 00:39:21,256
automatically.

1203
00:39:22,696 --> 00:39:24,016
And platforms, which can be

1204
00:39:24,016 --> 00:39:25,946
navigated and understood through

1205
00:39:25,946 --> 00:39:27,836
sound for those who can't read

1206
00:39:27,836 --> 00:39:28,236
visually.

1207
00:39:28,856 --> 00:39:32,576
And we read a lot on our iPhones

1208
00:39:32,766 --> 00:39:33,276
or iPads.

1209
00:39:33,996 --> 00:39:36,026
Sometimes it's good news, other

1210
00:39:36,026 --> 00:39:36,976
times it's bad news.

1211
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:39,126
Or, depending on where you look,

1212
00:39:39,266 --> 00:39:42,946
it could be fake news, like

1213
00:39:42,946 --> 00:39:44,276
these revelations about Lorem

1214
00:39:44,276 --> 00:39:44,736
ipsum.

1215
00:39:47,926 --> 00:39:50,286
So, here's the same article with

1216
00:39:50,286 --> 00:39:51,776
some visual considerations for

1217
00:39:51,776 --> 00:39:52,756
dynamic type.

1218
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:55,546
The headline is moved outside

1219
00:39:55,546 --> 00:39:57,176
the hero image for better

1220
00:39:57,176 --> 00:39:58,956
contrast and for practicality.

1221
00:40:00,046 --> 00:40:01,736
And the content is readable at

1222
00:40:01,736 --> 00:40:02,706
my preferred size.

1223
00:40:03,486 --> 00:40:05,226
And it still looks great.

1224
00:40:05,916 --> 00:40:07,526
But what if you couldn't read a

1225
00:40:07,526 --> 00:40:08,026
price tag?

1226
00:40:08,026 --> 00:40:10,296
What would the experience of

1227
00:40:10,356 --> 00:40:11,216
buying things be like?

1228
00:40:11,326 --> 00:40:14,676
You can't tap on a price tag to

1229
00:40:14,676 --> 00:40:17,646
hear an audio cue, but on an

1230
00:40:17,646 --> 00:40:19,866
iPhone, iPad, or Mac you can do

1231
00:40:19,866 --> 00:40:22,556
exactly that and more.

1232
00:40:22,796 --> 00:40:24,486
So, here we are shopping for

1233
00:40:24,596 --> 00:40:27,076
fresh, delicious, emoji-fied

1234
00:40:27,176 --> 00:40:27,686
fruit.

1235
00:40:28,666 --> 00:40:30,736
And there's a two-column layout

1236
00:40:30,736 --> 00:40:31,626
at default settings.

1237
00:40:32,126 --> 00:40:33,476
So, if we turn up dynamic types

1238
00:40:33,476 --> 00:40:36,096
a bit, we could reflow the

1239
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:37,536
content into one linear list.

1240
00:40:38,966 --> 00:40:40,376
Similar to how you would on a

1241
00:40:40,376 --> 00:40:41,976
responsive website between

1242
00:40:41,976 --> 00:40:43,576
desktop and mobile breakpoints.

1243
00:40:44,446 --> 00:40:45,856
Giving enough space to elements

1244
00:40:46,186 --> 00:40:47,876
to make them simpler and easier

1245
00:40:48,736 --> 00:40:49,906
to pass.

1246
00:40:50,116 --> 00:40:51,256
And here's our product page for

1247
00:40:51,256 --> 00:40:51,886
this pineapple.

1248
00:40:53,946 --> 00:40:54,926
Adapting your layout

1249
00:40:54,926 --> 00:40:56,736
appropriately makes sure the

1250
00:40:56,736 --> 00:40:57,986
most important actions are

1251
00:40:57,986 --> 00:40:58,926
available immediately.

1252
00:40:59,906 --> 00:41:00,976
So, again if we bump up the

1253
00:40:59,906 --> 00:41:00,976
So, again if we bump up the

1254
00:41:00,976 --> 00:41:04,146
dynamic type that's working

1255
00:41:04,146 --> 00:41:04,536
pretty well.

1256
00:41:05,376 --> 00:41:06,846
But, let's turn it up to the

1257
00:41:06,846 --> 00:41:07,406
maximum.

1258
00:41:08,106 --> 00:41:11,336
Nice, but is there more we can

1259
00:41:11,336 --> 00:41:11,676
do here?

1260
00:41:12,576 --> 00:41:14,996
If we scroll the card, we can

1261
00:41:14,996 --> 00:41:17,326
see the most desired actions are

1262
00:41:17,326 --> 00:41:18,196
a little bit far way.

1263
00:41:19,016 --> 00:41:20,916
So, maybe we'd consider swapping

1264
00:41:20,916 --> 00:41:21,936
them in this context.

1265
00:41:22,706 --> 00:41:25,206
Yes. And that's definitely

1266
00:41:25,886 --> 00:41:26,016
better.

1267
00:41:26,976 --> 00:41:28,166
Well, what about music,

1268
00:41:29,116 --> 00:41:31,476
podcasts, stories, sound?

1269
00:41:32,826 --> 00:41:34,256
Audio content is great because

1270
00:41:34,256 --> 00:41:35,596
it plays over the air, or your

1271
00:41:35,596 --> 00:41:36,046
headphones.

1272
00:41:36,686 --> 00:41:37,776
You don't need a UI to be

1273
00:41:37,776 --> 00:41:38,636
entertained by it.

1274
00:41:39,396 --> 00:41:40,736
But you do need a UI to be able

1275
00:41:40,736 --> 00:41:42,186
to discover it.

1276
00:41:43,376 --> 00:41:45,076
And in the new podcast and music

1277
00:41:45,076 --> 00:41:47,086
apps on iOS 11, the content

1278
00:41:47,086 --> 00:41:48,686
adapts to your preferences and

1279
00:41:48,686 --> 00:41:50,246
can be used with VoiceOver, so

1280
00:41:50,246 --> 00:41:51,766
everyone can access it.

1281
00:41:52,396 --> 00:41:56,096
Now, finally potential energy.

1282
00:41:56,546 --> 00:41:57,586
Unlocking potential.

1283
00:41:58,236 --> 00:42:00,856
If we make more things possible

1284
00:41:58,236 --> 00:42:00,856
If we make more things possible

1285
00:42:01,316 --> 00:42:03,306
for more types of people, more

1286
00:42:03,306 --> 00:42:03,936
things can happen.

1287
00:42:05,146 --> 00:42:07,116
Awesome things like iconic

1288
00:42:07,176 --> 00:42:09,016
albums or pioneering science.

1289
00:42:10,006 --> 00:42:11,376
Or miraculous things like

1290
00:42:11,566 --> 00:42:13,646
remembering your friends'

1291
00:42:14,736 --> 00:42:14,946
birthdays.

1292
00:42:15,086 --> 00:42:16,526
Simple things like sending a

1293
00:42:16,526 --> 00:42:18,246
gift or a message to a loved

1294
00:42:18,866 --> 00:42:18,976
one.

1295
00:42:20,716 --> 00:42:21,886
Can anyone read that?

1296
00:42:24,386 --> 00:42:26,616
We're reliant on language and

1297
00:42:26,616 --> 00:42:29,306
our remarkable use of it is

1298
00:42:29,306 --> 00:42:30,696
perhaps the primary reason for

1299
00:42:30,696 --> 00:42:32,056
our success as a species.

1300
00:42:32,946 --> 00:42:34,576
Be it through colors, text,

1301
00:42:35,196 --> 00:42:36,566
sound, or signs.

1302
00:42:37,296 --> 00:42:40,276
And what about now?

1303
00:42:41,286 --> 00:42:42,586
German speakers in the room are

1304
00:42:42,586 --> 00:42:43,796
one step ahead of us.

1305
00:42:44,836 --> 00:42:45,886
If we don't communicate in

1306
00:42:45,886 --> 00:42:48,176
everyone's language, how can we

1307
00:42:48,176 --> 00:42:49,986
help them accomplish things?

1308
00:42:51,096 --> 00:42:53,336
Without understanding, we can't

1309
00:42:53,336 --> 00:42:54,436
create any value at all.

1310
00:42:54,506 --> 00:42:58,686
I read an amazing article

1311
00:42:58,686 --> 00:43:00,776
earlier this week called, "The

1312
00:42:58,686 --> 00:43:00,776
earlier this week called, "The

1313
00:43:00,836 --> 00:43:02,896
Thoughts of a Spider Web" by

1314
00:43:02,896 --> 00:43:03,756
Joshua Sokol.

1315
00:43:04,936 --> 00:43:06,366
And in it there was an example

1316
00:43:07,056 --> 00:43:09,486
about how bees use ultraviolet

1317
00:43:09,486 --> 00:43:11,806
vision to find flowers that have

1318
00:43:11,806 --> 00:43:13,406
also evolved ultraviolet

1319
00:43:13,406 --> 00:43:13,836
markings.

1320
00:43:15,186 --> 00:43:16,426
And beside it a quote which

1321
00:43:16,456 --> 00:43:19,106
said, "if you don't have those

1322
00:43:19,106 --> 00:43:21,736
receptors that part of the world

1323
00:43:21,736 --> 00:43:23,526
simply doesn't exist."

1324
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:27,626
Design that includes everyone is

1325
00:43:27,626 --> 00:43:30,206
not good design, it's great

1326
00:43:30,946 --> 00:43:31,096
design.

1327
00:43:32,116 --> 00:43:33,616
So, design with integrity.

1328
00:43:34,216 --> 00:43:36,056
Take responsibility, caring

1329
00:43:36,056 --> 00:43:38,156
about everyone's experience, not

1330
00:43:38,156 --> 00:43:38,696
just your own.

1331
00:43:39,886 --> 00:43:41,826
And be empathetic considering

1332
00:43:41,826 --> 00:43:43,676
the perspectives of others who

1333
00:43:43,676 --> 00:43:44,906
interact with the world in

1334
00:43:44,906 --> 00:43:46,676
different ways than you do.

1335
00:43:47,306 --> 00:43:49,436
And understand that by doing so

1336
00:43:49,436 --> 00:43:51,856
we can help unlock potential, in

1340
00:44:02,346 --> 00:44:04,556
&gt;&gt; So, together we can strive

1341
00:44:04,776 --> 00:44:06,486
for simplicity and

1342
00:44:06,486 --> 00:44:08,116
perceivability in our apps.

1343
00:44:08,296 --> 00:44:10,126
And do it all with integrity for

1344
00:44:10,126 --> 00:44:11,676
making good apps great.

1345
00:44:13,076 --> 00:44:14,896
I encourage you to start now.

1346
00:44:15,136 --> 00:44:17,026
Go home and audit your apps.

1347
00:44:17,216 --> 00:44:18,676
Start conversations with your

1348
00:44:18,676 --> 00:44:20,446
team and people who use your

1349
00:44:20,446 --> 00:44:20,906
apps.

1350
00:44:21,546 --> 00:44:22,986
And most importantly schedule

1351
00:44:22,986 --> 00:44:24,676
time to see it all the way into

1352
00:44:24,676 --> 00:44:25,596
customers' hands.

1353
00:44:26,666 --> 00:44:28,676
And lastly do it proudly.

1354
00:44:29,076 --> 00:44:31,346
We can give everyone the chance

1355
00:44:31,346 --> 00:44:33,406
to be surprised, delighted, feel

1356
00:44:33,406 --> 00:44:34,466
good, and empowered.

1357
00:44:35,366 --> 00:44:37,396
We especially as designers would

1358
00:44:37,396 --> 00:44:39,176
always like things to line up

1359
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:40,916
just right, but you can't

1360
00:44:40,916 --> 00:44:42,206
control every line break.

1361
00:44:42,836 --> 00:44:44,566
You can't control how someone

1362
00:44:44,566 --> 00:44:45,796
will need to personalize their

1363
00:44:45,796 --> 00:44:47,706
experience because everyone is

1364
00:44:47,706 --> 00:44:48,136
different.

1365
00:44:48,136 --> 00:44:50,186
And let's celebrate that.

1366
00:44:52,516 --> 00:44:53,716
&gt;&gt; We're really proud of what

1367
00:44:53,716 --> 00:44:54,736
we've achieved in Maps this

1368
00:44:54,736 --> 00:44:57,056
year, but there's more to do and

1369
00:44:57,056 --> 00:44:57,806
we're going to keep going,

1370
00:44:58,026 --> 00:44:59,886
because a map is never finished.

1371
00:45:00,996 --> 00:45:02,086
And everyone wants to find their

1372
00:45:02,086 --> 00:45:02,296
way.

1373
00:45:02,696 --> 00:45:03,916
So, we're designing for everyone

1374
00:45:04,006 --> 00:45:05,046
and we really hope you'll join

1375
