1
00:00:22,086 --> 00:00:22,466
&gt;&gt; Hi everyone.

2
00:00:22,726 --> 00:00:23,826
Today we're going to talk about

3
00:00:23,826 --> 00:00:25,336
something very colorful.

4
00:00:26,036 --> 00:00:29,846
Display P3 and Wide Gamut, what

5
00:00:29,846 --> 00:00:31,736
that is and how we use it.

6
00:00:32,316 --> 00:00:34,476
But first I want to mention

7
00:00:34,476 --> 00:00:35,746
color management real quick.

8
00:00:36,656 --> 00:00:37,956
With color management we make

9
00:00:37,956 --> 00:00:39,416
sure that the display colors as

10
00:00:39,506 --> 00:00:41,526
accurately as possible across

11
00:00:41,576 --> 00:00:44,206
devices, platforms, and color

12
00:00:44,206 --> 00:00:44,796
spaces.

13
00:00:45,576 --> 00:00:47,116
And color management is built

14
00:00:47,226 --> 00:00:50,176
into both Mac OS and iOS.

15
00:00:51,606 --> 00:00:53,606
And color management helps avoid

16
00:00:53,606 --> 00:00:55,286
a situation like this where

17
00:00:55,286 --> 00:00:56,706
colors are incorrectly

18
00:00:56,706 --> 00:00:59,966
represented going from source to

19
00:00:59,966 --> 00:01:00,526
device.

20
00:00:59,966 --> 00:01:00,526
device.

21
00:01:01,896 --> 00:01:03,736
So as a designer makes sure to

22
00:01:03,786 --> 00:01:05,906
tag your assets properly to

23
00:01:05,906 --> 00:01:07,686
allow for color management to

24
00:01:07,686 --> 00:01:09,496
accurately display your colors.

25
00:01:10,876 --> 00:01:13,596
So what is then Display P3?

26
00:01:14,256 --> 00:01:15,646
Very simply put it's a color

27
00:01:15,646 --> 00:01:17,846
space within the RGB color model

28
00:01:18,106 --> 00:01:19,336
that represents a larger

29
00:01:19,336 --> 00:01:20,966
spectrum of colors than the

30
00:01:20,966 --> 00:01:24,166
current industry standard sRGB.

31
00:01:24,166 --> 00:01:25,496
And most of us have been using

32
00:01:25,816 --> 00:01:27,496
sRGB for probably over a decade

33
00:01:27,496 --> 00:01:31,156
now, but with display P3 we get

34
00:01:31,546 --> 00:01:34,016
a 25 percent larger color space

35
00:01:34,346 --> 00:01:35,166
compared to sRGB.

36
00:01:35,166 --> 00:01:36,656
This means that they can

37
00:01:36,656 --> 00:01:38,656
represent more colors with

38
00:01:38,656 --> 00:01:40,076
better accuracy and stay more

39
00:01:40,076 --> 00:01:41,456
true to what those colors

40
00:01:41,786 --> 00:01:43,536
actually look like in real life.

41
00:01:44,306 --> 00:01:45,976
And in this image the black

42
00:01:45,976 --> 00:01:47,586
strobe represents the size of

43
00:01:47,786 --> 00:01:49,956
the sRGB color space and as you

44
00:01:49,956 --> 00:01:52,486
can see the Display P3 extends

45
00:01:52,656 --> 00:01:55,166
way beyond that.

46
00:01:55,526 --> 00:01:56,756
And when the color space is

47
00:01:56,936 --> 00:01:58,456
larger than sRGB it is

48
00:01:58,456 --> 00:02:00,696
informally referred to as a wide

49
00:01:58,456 --> 00:02:00,696
informally referred to as a wide

50
00:02:00,696 --> 00:02:03,546
gamut color space, also displays

51
00:02:03,766 --> 00:02:05,136
supporting a larger color space

52
00:02:05,516 --> 00:02:07,476
than sRGB referred to as wide

53
00:02:07,606 --> 00:02:08,425
gamut displays.

54
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:11,306
And the late 2015 iMac Retina

55
00:02:11,706 --> 00:02:13,116
was the first consumer-facing

56
00:02:13,116 --> 00:02:15,586
computer that supported Display

57
00:02:16,746 --> 00:02:16,813
P3.

58
00:02:18,046 --> 00:02:19,506
When working with the Display P3

59
00:02:19,506 --> 00:02:21,146
color profile you have the

60
00:02:21,146 --> 00:02:22,616
opportunity to also use a larger

61
00:02:22,616 --> 00:02:23,416
color depth.

62
00:02:23,796 --> 00:02:25,586
16 bit per channel instead of

63
00:02:25,586 --> 00:02:26,286
the usual 8.

64
00:02:27,216 --> 00:02:28,616
That allows you to represent

65
00:02:28,616 --> 00:02:29,926
more colors within the wide

66
00:02:29,986 --> 00:02:32,676
gamut, which is especially

67
00:02:32,676 --> 00:02:34,166
useful for gradients.

68
00:02:34,646 --> 00:02:35,596
So let's take a look at an

69
00:02:35,596 --> 00:02:37,886
example of that.

70
00:02:38,096 --> 00:02:39,026
Now this is a somewhat

71
00:02:39,026 --> 00:02:40,756
exaggerated example, but clearly

72
00:02:40,756 --> 00:02:42,386
we have banding happening in

73
00:02:42,906 --> 00:02:44,186
this sRGB gradient.

74
00:02:44,446 --> 00:02:46,016
Something i could try to get run

75
00:02:46,016 --> 00:02:47,006
by using dithering.

76
00:02:47,056 --> 00:02:49,076
And it will look something like

77
00:02:49,076 --> 00:02:49,426
this.

78
00:02:50,946 --> 00:02:52,686
Or if I instead use Display

79
00:02:52,686 --> 00:02:55,076
P3and set my color depth to 16

80
00:02:55,076 --> 00:02:56,786
bits per channel, then banding

81
00:02:56,786 --> 00:02:58,756
is then much less visible.

82
00:02:59,606 --> 00:03:01,266
We're simply closing the gap

83
00:02:59,606 --> 00:03:01,266
We're simply closing the gap

84
00:03:01,676 --> 00:03:03,346
between each defined color,

85
00:03:03,626 --> 00:03:05,646
giving us a much better result.

86
00:03:07,586 --> 00:03:09,696
And we chose to display P3 for

87
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:11,396
its similarities to our existing

88
00:03:11,396 --> 00:03:12,576
view and conditions that were

89
00:03:12,576 --> 00:03:14,956
already defined in sRGB.

90
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:17,346
Then by lining both the gamut

91
00:03:17,436 --> 00:03:19,016
and the wide points, we get a

92
00:03:19,016 --> 00:03:20,486
color space that behaves very

93
00:03:20,486 --> 00:03:22,986
similar, making the threshold to

94
00:03:22,986 --> 00:03:24,666
understand again working with

95
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:26,496
Display P3 much lower.

96
00:03:28,496 --> 00:03:30,006
But before we move on I want to

97
00:03:30,006 --> 00:03:31,186
mention that since we're looking

98
00:03:31,186 --> 00:03:33,126
at this presentation on sRGB

99
00:03:33,126 --> 00:03:35,246
based projection system, all of

100
00:03:35,246 --> 00:03:36,286
the examples in this

101
00:03:36,286 --> 00:03:37,996
presentation are renditions,

102
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:41,276
which then leads me to who can

103
00:03:41,276 --> 00:03:43,386
actually see Display P3 Images?

104
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:48,106
Well users needs a wide gamut

105
00:03:48,106 --> 00:03:49,666
display that supports the

106
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:51,736
Display P3 color space and color

107
00:03:51,776 --> 00:03:52,496
profile.

108
00:03:52,786 --> 00:03:54,056
And Apple has supported wide

109
00:03:54,056 --> 00:03:55,716
gamut displays since the late

110
00:03:55,716 --> 00:03:57,276
2015 iMac Retina.

111
00:03:57,826 --> 00:03:59,336
But now there's a wider range of

112
00:03:59,336 --> 00:04:01,746
devices that all support Display

113
00:03:59,336 --> 00:04:01,746
devices that all support Display

114
00:04:02,226 --> 00:04:03,676
P3 -- for example, the iPhone 7,

115
00:04:04,346 --> 00:04:05,946
the MacBook Pro with a Touch Bar

116
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:07,926
and also the iPad Pro.

117
00:04:08,776 --> 00:04:10,766
But what about you as a

118
00:04:10,766 --> 00:04:11,316
designer?

119
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,646
Because you do not want to be

120
00:04:13,646 --> 00:04:15,666
flying blind when creating

121
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:16,856
Display P3 assets.

122
00:04:17,156 --> 00:04:18,826
You want full control over your

123
00:04:18,826 --> 00:04:19,336
colors.

124
00:04:20,196 --> 00:04:22,246
So make sure to work on a wide

125
00:04:22,246 --> 00:04:24,316
gamut display that supports

126
00:04:24,316 --> 00:04:26,166
Display P3 like the MacBook Pro

127
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:27,426
of the Touch Bar, the iMac

128
00:04:27,426 --> 00:04:30,646
Retina, or the LG5K Display.

129
00:04:32,586 --> 00:04:34,596
So now we know what display P3

130
00:04:34,596 --> 00:04:36,116
is and how we can see it.

131
00:04:36,116 --> 00:04:37,486
Let's take a look at an example.

132
00:04:38,886 --> 00:04:40,216
In this beautiful image we have

133
00:04:40,216 --> 00:04:41,326
some really nice colors.

134
00:04:41,426 --> 00:04:43,136
Some with wide ranges of red,

135
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:44,356
green, and orange.

136
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:46,676
Now this is an sRGB image to

137
00:04:46,676 --> 00:04:47,386
current standard.

138
00:04:48,446 --> 00:04:50,306
But because of the limitations

139
00:04:50,306 --> 00:04:52,976
within sRGB, not all colors that

140
00:04:52,976 --> 00:04:54,726
were captured by the camera are

141
00:04:54,726 --> 00:04:55,626
in this photo.

142
00:04:56,276 --> 00:04:57,766
Represented here by these light

143
00:04:57,766 --> 00:04:58,246
blue fields.

144
00:04:59,266 --> 00:05:00,706
Simply because these colors were

145
00:04:59,266 --> 00:05:00,706
Simply because these colors were

146
00:05:00,706 --> 00:05:02,886
not available in the sRGB color

147
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:03,446
space.

148
00:05:04,586 --> 00:05:06,656
The display P3 version of the

149
00:05:06,656 --> 00:05:08,516
same image is a completely

150
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:09,236
different story.

151
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:12,236
Now we have rich, beautiful, and

152
00:05:12,236 --> 00:05:13,536
bold colors throughout the

153
00:05:13,536 --> 00:05:14,646
entire image.

154
00:05:16,236 --> 00:05:17,456
And if you compare the three

155
00:05:17,456 --> 00:05:18,956
images we have a pretty

156
00:05:18,956 --> 00:05:20,736
significant difference and I

157
00:05:20,786 --> 00:05:22,436
almost feel a little bit sad for

158
00:05:22,436 --> 00:05:23,466
out buddy here on the left.

159
00:05:23,466 --> 00:05:25,316
He looks really bad right now.

160
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:29,736
OK, so let's take a look at the

161
00:05:29,736 --> 00:05:31,246
Display P3 Workflow and we're

162
00:05:31,246 --> 00:05:32,356
going to be using Photoshop.

163
00:05:33,726 --> 00:05:35,266
And let's begin with a brand new

164
00:05:35,266 --> 00:05:37,306
document, and in order to take

165
00:05:37,306 --> 00:05:38,376
full advantage of all of the

166
00:05:38,376 --> 00:05:40,636
colors available in the Display

167
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:42,346
P3 Color Space, the first thing

168
00:05:42,346 --> 00:05:44,136
you need to do is to tag your

169
00:05:44,136 --> 00:05:45,666
asset with the correct color

170
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:46,386
profile.

171
00:05:47,116 --> 00:05:48,386
So I'm creating that new

172
00:05:48,386 --> 00:05:50,246
document in Photoshop, make sure

173
00:05:50,246 --> 00:05:51,496
to set your color profile to

174
00:05:51,576 --> 00:05:53,436
Display P3 like this.

175
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:57,096
And the next thing I want to do

176
00:05:57,096 --> 00:05:58,616
is to change the color depth

177
00:05:59,906 --> 00:06:02,306
from 8 to 16 bits per channel

178
00:05:59,906 --> 00:06:02,306
from 8 to 16 bits per channel

179
00:06:03,406 --> 00:06:05,916
like this.

180
00:06:06,456 --> 00:06:07,586
And once you're finished with

181
00:06:07,586 --> 00:06:09,266
you're absolutely fantastic

182
00:06:09,266 --> 00:06:11,296
design, it is now time to save

183
00:06:11,296 --> 00:06:12,186
out your artwork.

184
00:06:12,496 --> 00:06:13,796
And there are multiple ways of

185
00:06:13,796 --> 00:06:15,766
doing so on Photoshop like using

186
00:06:15,766 --> 00:06:18,396
Generator or Export As.

187
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:21,546
But in this case it is key then

188
00:06:21,546 --> 00:06:23,846
to use Save As and PNG as your

189
00:06:23,996 --> 00:06:26,366
format because this is the only

190
00:06:26,366 --> 00:06:28,066
way at the moment to both imbed

191
00:06:28,066 --> 00:06:30,116
a color profile and maintain the

192
00:06:30,116 --> 00:06:33,666
color depth without -- in the

193
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:34,386
exported asset.

194
00:06:35,296 --> 00:06:37,716
For example, Generator will not

195
00:06:37,716 --> 00:06:39,046
imbed a color profile and leave

196
00:06:39,046 --> 00:06:40,806
your asset entirely untagged.

197
00:06:41,246 --> 00:06:45,286
So only use Save As.

198
00:06:46,006 --> 00:06:47,106
When opening raw files in

199
00:06:47,106 --> 00:06:49,396
Photoshop, make sure to tag --

200
00:06:49,396 --> 00:06:51,126
to change the color profile to

201
00:06:51,256 --> 00:06:53,286
display P3 and the color depth

202
00:06:53,286 --> 00:06:55,096
to 16 bits per channel by

203
00:06:55,096 --> 00:06:57,396
clicking here.

204
00:06:58,416 --> 00:06:59,826
Also, if you're receiving assets

205
00:06:59,826 --> 00:07:01,196
from someone else, makes sure

206
00:06:59,826 --> 00:07:01,196
from someone else, makes sure

207
00:07:01,196 --> 00:07:02,606
that those assets are converted

208
00:07:02,606 --> 00:07:04,796
to display P3 directly from the

209
00:07:04,796 --> 00:07:07,576
raw file and not sRGB as the

210
00:07:07,576 --> 00:07:08,866
color information would then

211
00:07:08,926 --> 00:07:10,496
already be completely lost.

212
00:07:11,156 --> 00:07:12,926
So walk down your asset pipeline

213
00:07:12,996 --> 00:07:14,836
and make sure you get Display P3

214
00:07:14,836 --> 00:07:16,836
assets directly from your

215
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:17,366
source.

216
00:07:18,806 --> 00:07:20,476
If you're working from an

217
00:07:20,476 --> 00:07:22,396
existing asset like an app icon,

218
00:07:23,786 --> 00:07:25,946
make sure to use Convert to

219
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:26,686
Profile.

220
00:07:26,996 --> 00:07:28,046
This will actually perform a

221
00:07:28,046 --> 00:07:29,776
color match operation and not

222
00:07:29,826 --> 00:07:30,776
alter your design.

223
00:07:33,376 --> 00:07:33,946
Click like that.

224
00:07:34,726 --> 00:07:37,326
And do not use Assign to Profile

225
00:07:37,326 --> 00:07:38,776
as that will take your existing

226
00:07:38,776 --> 00:07:40,336
colors and stretch those out

227
00:07:40,336 --> 00:07:41,746
into the new color space

228
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:43,886
changing your design in some

229
00:07:43,886 --> 00:07:44,126
way.

230
00:07:44,586 --> 00:07:46,866
So always use Convert to

231
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:47,286
profile.

232
00:07:48,476 --> 00:07:50,196
As an example let's look what

233
00:07:50,196 --> 00:07:52,126
happens to the RGB of values

234
00:07:52,446 --> 00:07:54,206
before and after converting to

235
00:07:54,206 --> 00:07:55,926
display P3 from an sRGB

236
00:07:55,926 --> 00:07:56,436
Gradient.

237
00:07:56,636 --> 00:07:57,596
And we're going to look at the

238
00:07:57,726 --> 00:08:00,236
red color spefically here.

239
00:07:57,726 --> 00:08:00,236
red color spefically here.

240
00:08:00,986 --> 00:08:02,406
Now in this sRGB image you can

241
00:08:02,406 --> 00:08:03,676
see that I'll all the way up in

242
00:08:03,676 --> 00:08:06,286
the top right corner and our RGB

243
00:08:06,286 --> 00:08:09,386
values are then 255, 0, 0.

244
00:08:09,386 --> 00:08:10,826
That's pretty much as red as it

245
00:08:10,826 --> 00:08:11,136
gets.

246
00:08:13,196 --> 00:08:15,526
But after converting to display

247
00:08:15,706 --> 00:08:16,836
P3 I can now see that I have a

248
00:08:16,836 --> 00:08:19,286
lot more red to work with and I

249
00:08:19,286 --> 00:08:21,276
can also see that my RGB values

250
00:08:21,396 --> 00:08:23,636
has now changed.

251
00:08:24,676 --> 00:08:26,316
So you guys are now ready to go

252
00:08:26,316 --> 00:08:28,466
and create stunning Display P3

253
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:29,526
Assets for your app.

254
00:08:30,296 --> 00:08:32,336
But before you do take a second

255
00:08:32,336 --> 00:08:34,166
and ask the question, should I?

256
00:08:35,226 --> 00:08:37,076
Display P3 works great in some

257
00:08:37,076 --> 00:08:39,376
cases, in others it's just not

258
00:08:39,426 --> 00:08:40,206
the right choice.

259
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:42,336
For example, if your app is

260
00:08:42,366 --> 00:08:43,576
designed with a calm,

261
00:08:43,696 --> 00:08:45,596
de-saturated color scheme, it

262
00:08:45,596 --> 00:08:46,866
doesn't use a lot of imagery,

263
00:08:47,186 --> 00:08:48,696
display P3 might not be the

264
00:08:48,696 --> 00:08:50,156
right choice for you.

265
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:52,336
But it is great for calling

266
00:08:52,336 --> 00:08:54,466
attention to certain details

267
00:08:54,466 --> 00:08:56,516
within your UI, such like a VU

268
00:08:56,516 --> 00:08:58,486
meter or the red line in the rev

269
00:08:58,486 --> 00:08:58,836
counter.

270
00:08:59,296 --> 00:09:00,776
Or used to smooth out that app

271
00:08:59,296 --> 00:09:00,776
Or used to smooth out that app

272
00:09:00,976 --> 00:09:01,996
icon gradient.

273
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:05,116
Or if your app uses a lot of

274
00:09:05,116 --> 00:09:07,096
scenic imagery of nature,

275
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:08,306
landscapes, or travel

276
00:09:08,306 --> 00:09:09,886
destinations, this use of

277
00:09:09,996 --> 00:09:11,926
Display P3 makes a whole lot of

278
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:13,806
sense because these images will

279
00:09:13,806 --> 00:09:15,876
look more vibrant and richer and

280
00:09:15,906 --> 00:09:17,746
colors will stay more true to

281
00:09:17,746 --> 00:09:19,266
what they actually looked like

282
00:09:19,266 --> 00:09:20,406
when the camera captured that

283
00:09:20,626 --> 00:09:22,736
very specific and special image.

284
00:09:23,856 --> 00:09:24,946
Or for apps that feature

285
00:09:25,006 --> 00:09:26,886
textiles or garments were shown

286
00:09:26,886 --> 00:09:28,876
the true color of a dress or a

287
00:09:28,876 --> 00:09:30,356
pair of pants is immensely

288
00:09:30,356 --> 00:09:30,836
important.

289
00:09:33,246 --> 00:09:35,576
So in conclusion, we have the

290
00:09:35,576 --> 00:09:37,826
Display P3 color space and color

291
00:09:37,826 --> 00:09:38,516
profile.

292
00:09:39,086 --> 00:09:40,936
It is 25 percent larger than

293
00:09:40,936 --> 00:09:43,706
sRGB and lots of your users

294
00:09:43,816 --> 00:09:45,746
already have compatible devices

295
00:09:45,986 --> 00:09:47,036
in their hands today.

296
00:09:48,086 --> 00:09:49,666
Then keep in mind the special

297
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:51,226
workflow when creating these

298
00:09:51,226 --> 00:09:53,326
assets and make sure to use it

299
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:56,306
where it makes sense.

300
00:09:56,996 --> 00:09:57,626
Thank you.
