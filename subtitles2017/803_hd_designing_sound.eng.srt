some ideas of how to incorporate

sound in your design process and

30
00:01:19,226 --> 00:01:20,456
why it makes sense to do so.

31
00:01:20,846 --> 00:01:23,466
Now, as a developer, you have a

lot on your plate and adding

33
00:01:24,906 --> 00:01:26,486
sound to your app is probably

00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:28,446

00:07:31,646 --> 00:07:32,956
stuck with the default we just

194
00:07:32,956 --> 00:07:34,796
heard, and it doesn't really say

195
00:07:34,796 --> 00:07:37,346
much about where it's coming

196
00:07:37,346 --> 00:07:41,496
from and what it means, so it's

197
00:07:41,496 --> 00:07:42,696
a missed opportunity to

198
00:07:42,986 --> 00:07:45,066
distinguish your app, your app's

199
00:07:45,066 --> 00:07:46,116
unique identity.

200
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:48,106
Now, before, when we were in the

201
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:49,536
forest, we heard the Dark Sky

202
00:07:49,536 --> 00:07:51,026
notification, and Dark Sky is a

203
00:07:51,026 --> 00:07:53,226
weather app, and it sends this

204
00:07:53,226 --> 00:07:54,936
notification when rain is

205
00:07:54,936 --> 00:07:55,426
imminent.

206
00:07:56,636 --> 00:07:57,986
It does this pretty well.

207
00:07:57,986 --> 00:07:59,096
Let's listen to it again.

208
00:07:59,096 --> 00:08:01,976
And why does this work so well?

209
00:07:59,096 --> 00:08:01,976
And why does this work so well?

210
00:08:02,016 --> 00:08:03,330
[beeping].

211
00:08:04,046 --> 00:08:06,236
This sound is easily

212
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:07,066
recognizable.

213
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:08,756
When you hear this, you know

214
00:08:09,046 --> 00:08:10,246
it's coming from Dark Sky.

215
00:08:11,106 --> 00:08:12,806
It conveys a message.

216
00:08:12,806 --> 00:08:14,566
It's not a direct recording of

217
00:08:14,566 --> 00:08:16,056
raindrops, but it has this

218
00:08:16,056 --> 00:08:17,366
liquid quality to it.

219
00:08:17,366 --> 00:08:20,056
It helps you connect the sound

220
00:08:20,056 --> 00:08:21,186
to the message it's sending.

221
00:08:21,776 --> 00:08:24,366
It's a friendly sound.

222
00:08:24,736 --> 00:08:26,296
It's not jarring, but telling

223
00:08:26,296 --> 00:08:28,156
you in a friendly way it's time

224
00:08:28,156 --> 00:08:29,086
to find cover soon.

225
00:08:30,096 --> 00:08:31,966
And it's a simple and clean

226
00:08:32,025 --> 00:08:34,746
sound, quite pleasant to listen

227
00:08:34,746 --> 00:08:38,135
to as well.

228
00:08:38,285 --> 00:08:40,126
So let's try this ourselves.

229
00:08:40,126 --> 00:08:41,525
Let's create a sound for an app.

230
00:08:41,686 --> 00:08:44,285
Shall we? Well, first we need an

231
00:08:44,285 --> 00:08:44,876
app, of course.

232
00:08:44,876 --> 00:08:47,936
Well, luckily, some years ago,

233
00:08:47,936 --> 00:08:50,106
our prototyping team did a

234
00:08:50,106 --> 00:08:50,606
session.

235
00:08:50,686 --> 00:08:52,536
It was called "Fake It Till You

236
00:08:52,536 --> 00:08:52,906
Make It."

237
00:08:52,906 --> 00:08:54,586
It was about creating fake apps

238
00:08:54,586 --> 00:08:56,086
in order to learn from how

239
00:08:56,086 --> 00:08:57,246
people would interact with them.

240
00:08:58,326 --> 00:08:59,546
They create an app called Toast

241
00:08:59,546 --> 00:08:59,976
Modern.

242
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:04,156
Now, maybe some of you know that

243
00:09:04,156 --> 00:09:05,596
toast has become very popular in

244
00:09:05,596 --> 00:09:07,916
San Francisco, and people pay a

245
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:10,146
lot of money for a slice of what

246
00:09:10,146 --> 00:09:11,766
some call hipster toast.

247
00:09:14,786 --> 00:09:16,176
Toast Modern, the app they

248
00:09:16,176 --> 00:09:18,346
created, helps you find

249
00:09:19,576 --> 00:09:21,126
overpriced artisanal toast on

250
00:09:21,126 --> 00:09:22,256
the streets of San Francisco

251
00:09:24,356 --> 00:09:25,416
[laughter] and share this with

252
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:27,386
your friends and family.

253
00:09:27,946 --> 00:09:33,176
Now if someone sends you some

254
00:09:33,176 --> 00:09:34,626
newly discovered toast, you get

255
00:09:34,626 --> 00:09:35,396
a notification.

256
00:09:35,816 --> 00:09:36,966
So we can create a sound for

257
00:09:36,966 --> 00:09:37,786
this notification.

258
00:09:38,196 --> 00:09:38,986
Let's do that.

259
00:09:40,736 --> 00:09:41,926
We can start by asking ourselves

260
00:09:41,926 --> 00:09:43,836
some questions, like, "What is

261
00:09:43,836 --> 00:09:45,396
the essence of what this app is

262
00:09:45,396 --> 00:09:45,736
about?"

263
00:09:46,816 --> 00:09:48,546
Well, in this case, simple.

264
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:50,246
It's about finding toast and

265
00:09:50,246 --> 00:09:52,696
sharing it with your friends.

266
00:09:52,856 --> 00:09:54,636
What emotion do we want to evoke

267
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:55,896
here when people receive this

268
00:09:55,896 --> 00:09:56,686
notification?

269
00:09:56,726 --> 00:09:58,566
Well, we want them to be happy

270
00:09:58,566 --> 00:09:59,966
they found some new toast to try

271
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:01,496
and eager to try it out.

272
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:01,496
and eager to try it out.

273
00:10:02,846 --> 00:10:05,246
How do we match the app's

274
00:10:05,306 --> 00:10:05,986
aesthetics?

275
00:10:05,986 --> 00:10:09,626
We just saw the screen, and it

276
00:10:09,626 --> 00:10:11,016
looks pretty functional and

277
00:10:11,016 --> 00:10:12,776
simple, so let's keep the sound

278
00:10:12,776 --> 00:10:15,616
similar to that, keep it simple

279
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:16,276
and to the point.

280
00:10:16,906 --> 00:10:19,626
And if we notice, we can start

281
00:10:19,626 --> 00:10:21,796
with some sound sources.

282
00:10:21,796 --> 00:10:23,516
We can record some sounds to be

283
00:10:23,516 --> 00:10:24,326
inspired by.

284
00:10:24,326 --> 00:10:26,386
In this case, let's just get

285
00:10:26,386 --> 00:10:26,846
some bread.

286
00:10:26,846 --> 00:10:29,216
Let's get a toaster and record

287
00:10:29,216 --> 00:10:29,756
those sounds.

288
00:10:30,506 --> 00:10:32,976
So that's exactly what we did,

289
00:10:32,976 --> 00:10:33,976
and here are some of the sounds

290
00:10:33,976 --> 00:10:34,546
we recorded.

291
00:10:35,486 --> 00:10:37,486
[ Toaster popping ]

292
00:10:37,956 --> 00:10:39,126
Toaster ejecting toast.

293
00:10:42,306 --> 00:10:43,526
Spreading butter on a piece of

294
00:10:43,526 --> 00:10:43,936
toast.

295
00:10:44,516 --> 00:10:47,036
[ Bread Crumbling ]

296
00:10:47,536 --> 00:10:48,856
The sound of toast breaking.

297
00:10:51,056 --> 00:10:52,656
And taking a bite out of a piece

298
00:10:52,656 --> 00:10:53,016
of toast.

299
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:55,076
Now we can also create a little

300
00:10:55,076 --> 00:10:56,026
bit of a story from the

301
00:10:56,026 --> 00:10:57,606
beginning to the end, you know,

302
00:10:58,076 --> 00:10:59,566
making toast and eating toast,

303
00:10:59,676 --> 00:11:00,660
and record the whole process.

304
00:10:59,676 --> 00:11:00,660
and record the whole process.

305
00:11:01,016 --> 00:11:03,016
[toaster popping].

306
00:11:03,016 --> 00:11:04,676
[timer ticking].

307
00:11:05,176 --> 00:11:07,516
[chiming].

308
00:11:08,016 --> 00:11:10,016
[scraping toast].

309
00:11:10,016 --> 00:11:11,436
[toast crunching].

310
00:11:11,436 --> 00:11:12,856
[laughter].

311
00:11:12,856 --> 00:11:15,706
Okay, now we have a nice

312
00:11:15,706 --> 00:11:16,416
palette.

313
00:11:16,726 --> 00:11:18,226
You notice we added some sounds

314
00:11:18,226 --> 00:11:20,286
to this, because in the initial

315
00:11:20,286 --> 00:11:21,916
set, there was not that timer

316
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:23,236
sound and the chime sounds, so

317
00:11:23,236 --> 00:11:24,276
we recorded those two.

318
00:11:24,776 --> 00:11:26,346
And now we can start making

319
00:11:27,096 --> 00:11:29,576
notification sounds.

320
00:11:30,286 --> 00:11:31,366
There's one sound that I like

321
00:11:31,366 --> 00:11:32,596
quite a bit.

322
00:11:32,596 --> 00:11:33,786
[toast crunching].

323
00:11:33,786 --> 00:11:34,636
It's a great sound.

324
00:11:34,636 --> 00:11:35,936
It's very characteristic, but

325
00:11:36,956 --> 00:11:38,466
maybe it doesn't work so well as

326
00:11:38,466 --> 00:11:39,646
a notification coming from your

327
00:11:39,646 --> 00:11:40,676
phone every day, right?

328
00:11:40,676 --> 00:11:42,076
It's a little harsh.

329
00:11:42,716 --> 00:11:45,446
So how about this one?

330
00:11:45,446 --> 00:11:46,356
[timer ticking].

331
00:11:46,356 --> 00:11:47,266
[chiming].

332
00:11:47,266 --> 00:11:48,676
There's this little timer sound

333
00:11:48,676 --> 00:11:50,706
and then the chime, but the only

334
00:11:50,706 --> 00:11:51,846
thing I don't really like about

335
00:11:51,846 --> 00:11:53,756
it is the sound of the toaster

336
00:11:53,756 --> 00:11:54,716
ejecting the toast.

337
00:11:54,716 --> 00:11:55,500
It's a little harsh.

338
00:11:55,776 --> 00:11:58,616
So we can find a more expensive

339
00:11:58,696 --> 00:12:00,266
toaster maybe, that'll sound

340
00:11:58,696 --> 00:12:00,266
toaster maybe, that'll sound

341
00:12:00,266 --> 00:12:02,856
better, or we can construct our

342
00:12:02,856 --> 00:12:04,266
own toaster sound.

343
00:12:05,466 --> 00:12:06,846
But why don't we just take away

344
00:12:06,846 --> 00:12:07,806
the parts we don't like and see

345
00:12:07,806 --> 00:12:08,330
what we're left with?

346
00:12:09,506 --> 00:12:12,976
So let's take that sound out.

347
00:12:12,976 --> 00:12:13,043
[timer ticking].

348
00:12:13,043 --> 00:12:13,110
[chiming].

349
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:15,656
Actually, this might work pretty

350
00:12:15,656 --> 00:12:16,036
well.

351
00:12:16,036 --> 00:12:18,266
Let's see what it looks like

352
00:12:18,266 --> 00:12:19,000
when the notification comes in.

353
00:12:20,016 --> 00:12:21,016
[timer ticking].

354
00:12:21,516 --> 00:12:23,766
[chiming].

355
00:12:24,266 --> 00:12:25,896
I think this is pretty good for

356
00:12:25,896 --> 00:12:26,086
now.

357
00:12:26,576 --> 00:12:28,056
Now remember, we're just trying

358
00:12:28,056 --> 00:12:28,536
things out.

359
00:12:29,266 --> 00:12:30,386
We're just prototyping.

360
00:12:30,936 --> 00:12:31,886
Even the app is fake.

361
00:12:32,106 --> 00:12:34,786
So, you know, we're not all

362
00:12:34,786 --> 00:12:36,606
sound designers, but once we

363
00:12:36,606 --> 00:12:38,076
start working with a sound

364
00:12:38,076 --> 00:12:39,016
designer, they can take this

365
00:12:39,016 --> 00:12:40,846
inspiration and maybe create

366
00:12:40,846 --> 00:12:42,776
something that's more unique,

367
00:12:42,776 --> 00:12:44,746
more ownable, and maybe more

368
00:12:44,746 --> 00:12:46,226
abstract, like the Dark Sky

369
00:12:46,226 --> 00:12:47,000
notification.

370
00:12:50,476 --> 00:12:51,956
Now what did the creative

371
00:12:51,956 --> 00:12:53,346
process look like here?

372
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:55,566
We started out with all these

373
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:56,706
toast recordings.

374
00:12:56,706 --> 00:12:57,646
Those are the blue dots.

375
00:12:57,976 --> 00:12:59,336
And then we realized we needed

376
00:12:59,336 --> 00:13:00,706
some other sounds to complete

377
00:12:59,336 --> 00:13:00,706
some other sounds to complete

378
00:13:00,706 --> 00:13:02,236
the palette, so we added the

379
00:13:02,276 --> 00:13:03,816
timer sound and the chime sound.

380
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:04,826
Those are the yellow ones.

381
00:13:05,286 --> 00:13:07,136
And then we created some

382
00:13:07,246 --> 00:13:09,006
candidates and tried them out on

383
00:13:09,006 --> 00:13:09,816
our device.

384
00:13:10,626 --> 00:13:12,326
We found out that a lot of these

385
00:13:12,326 --> 00:13:13,566
sounds didn't really work so

386
00:13:13,566 --> 00:13:16,156
well, so we ended up with the

387
00:13:16,156 --> 00:13:18,416
timer and the chime sound.

388
00:13:19,316 --> 00:13:21,506
Now why am I showing you this?

389
00:13:22,656 --> 00:13:24,206
Because it illustrates how often

390
00:13:24,206 --> 00:13:25,076
we start out with this

391
00:13:25,076 --> 00:13:26,446
assumption that something might

392
00:13:26,486 --> 00:13:28,836
work, but then we find out that,

393
00:13:28,836 --> 00:13:30,876
going this exploration phase, we

394
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:32,586
find out that what we really

395
00:13:32,586 --> 00:13:33,936
need is something different.

396
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:35,806
We have to go through this to

397
00:13:35,806 --> 00:13:36,976
understand that.

398
00:13:37,436 --> 00:13:38,956
First we have to make mistakes

399
00:13:38,956 --> 00:13:40,276
to come up with something great.

400
00:13:40,526 --> 00:13:44,986
Now what kind of sound sources

401
00:13:45,356 --> 00:13:46,486
can you record when you do an

402
00:13:46,486 --> 00:13:49,006
exploration like this?

403
00:13:49,226 --> 00:13:50,666
You could record an acoustic

404
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:54,216
instrument or an electronic

405
00:13:54,216 --> 00:13:55,816
instrument, like a synthesizer

406
00:13:55,816 --> 00:13:57,026
software or hardware.

407
00:13:58,406 --> 00:13:59,736
But really, we found out you can

408
00:13:59,736 --> 00:14:00,536
record anything.

410
00:14:01,956 --> 00:14:04,696
Anything that makes a sound can

411
00:14:04,696 --> 00:14:06,276
be an inspiration.

412
00:14:06,926 --> 00:14:11,726
Now at Apple, we use any of

413
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:12,826
these sound sources.

414
00:14:13,396 --> 00:14:16,666
It really depends on the project

415
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:19,356
we're working on, and some of

416
00:14:19,356 --> 00:14:20,886
them are easily recognizable

We use this notification sound

446
00:15:45,216 --> 00:15:47,326
We have to think about, when

447
00:15:47,326 --> 00:15:49,196
will people hear this sound, and

448
00:15:49,196 --> 00:15:50,406
what will they be doing?

simple, but there's another

458
00:16:06,476 --> 00:16:08,886
thing that is important that we

00:16:08,886 --> 00:16:11,966

It's a little bit more of a

488
00:17:10,996 --> 00:17:11,766
it's not a very common

simple and clear as well.

491
00:17:15,626 --> 00:17:18,346
Now when we were designing for

492
00:17:18,346 --> 00:17:20,695

493
00:17:20,695 --> 00:17:22,165
question, how can we be inspired

494
00:17:22,165 --> 00:17:23,715
by this beautiful industrial

495
00:17:23,715 --> 00:17:24,846

00:17:25,866 --> 00:17:27,675
And how can we create the

497
00:17:27,675 --> 00:17:30,226
illusion that what you hear,

498
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:32,586
that the sounds are actually

00:17:32,656 --> 00:17:35,806

00:17:37,756 --> 00:17:38,176
itself?

502
00:17:39,196 --> 00:17:40,446

00:19:51,316 --> 00:19:53,716
This means that even if you use

575
00:19:53,716 --> 00:19:55,726
it multiple times per day that

576
00:19:55,726 --> 00:19:56,846
it doesn't become annoying.

577
00:19:58,136 --> 00:19:59,556
A great way to try this out is

578
00:19:59,556 --> 00:20:01,216

just to put it on your phone for

00:20:01,216 --> 00:20:02,216
a little while, for a week or

581
00:20:02,216 --> 00:20:03,886
so, and live with it for a

582
00:20:03,886 --> 00:20:03,976
while.

583
00:20:05,056 --> 00:20:06,506
If after a week you still like

584
00:20:06,506 --> 00:20:08,156
the sound, it's probably a

585
00:20:08,156 --> 00:20:08,906
pretty good one.

586
00:20:10,056 --> 00:20:11,256
And then it's clear.

587
00:20:11,706 --> 00:20:12,466
It's clean.

588
00:20:13,476 --> 00:20:15,366
It cuts through noise, but it's

589
00:20:15,366 --> 00:20:16,016
not abrasive.

590
00:20:19,476 --> 00:20:20,136
All right.

591
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:23,746
Next, let's look at designing

592
00:20:23,746 --> 00:20:26,500
sound for UI elements.

593
00:20:35,626 --> 00:20:37,346
Now every object you interact

594
00:20:37,346 --> 00:20:39,636
with in the real world makes a

595
00:20:39,636 --> 00:20:42,826
sound, so it's very natural to

596
00:20:42,826 --> 00:20:44,606
expect that an object you

597
00:20:44,606 --> 00:20:45,846
interact with on the screen

598
00:20:46,426 --> 00:20:48,146
makes a sound as well, but we

599
00:20:48,146 --> 00:20:49,816
definitely don't do this for

600
00:20:49,816 --> 00:20:50,566
every interaction.

601
00:20:51,316 --> 00:20:53,436
We really try to find the right

602
00:20:53,506 --> 00:20:55,716
balance between no sound and too

603
00:20:55,716 --> 00:20:56,116
much.

604
00:20:58,296 --> 00:20:59,886
So UI sounds are things like

605
00:21:00,616 --> 00:21:03,306
keyboard sounds, scrolling

606
00:21:03,306 --> 00:21:05,316
sounds, pressing a button,

607
00:21:06,256 --> 00:21:09,076
tapping, swiping, or any kind of

608
00:21:09,076 --> 00:21:09,996
transitions.

609
00:21:10,646 --> 00:21:11,826
Now I want to focus on three of

610
00:21:11,826 --> 00:21:14,506
these and see how we approach

611
00:21:14,506 --> 00:21:15,816
them in our own devices.

612
00:21:16,306 --> 00:21:18,406
Let's start with the keyboard

614
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:22,376
Now following our previous

615
00:21:22,836 --> 00:21:25,006
design strategy, we may want to

616
00:21:25,006 --> 00:21:26,406
start by recording some actual

617
00:21:26,406 --> 00:21:27,866

618
00:21:27,866 --> 00:21:28,366

[ Typewriter clicking ]

620
00:21:36,066 --> 00:21:37,606
Now, this rattles quite a bit,

621
00:21:37,606 --> 00:21:39,336
but there's something satisfying

622
00:21:39,336 --> 00:21:40,626
about the letters hitting the

623
00:21:40,626 --> 00:21:40,996
paper.

624
00:21:41,086 --> 00:21:42,736
So let's remember that.

625
00:21:43,596 --> 00:21:45,286
How about a computer keyboard?

[ Typing sounds ]

627
00:21:52,056 --> 00:21:53,276
There's something pleasant about

628
00:21:53,276 --> 00:21:54,346
this sound as well.

629
00:21:54,486 --> 00:21:55,526
It's not very static.

630
00:21:55,966 --> 00:21:56,896
It's very lively.

631
00:21:57,476 --> 00:21:58,746
So not every key sounds the

632
00:21:58,746 --> 00:21:59,206
same.

633
00:22:00,056 --> 00:22:01,366
So we can remember this when we

634
00:22:01,416 --> 00:22:03,816
create our own sound for our iOS

636
00:22:05,476 --> 00:22:07,006
We're designing for software, so

637
00:22:07,006 --> 00:22:08,806
we can make it sound any way we

638
00:22:08,806 --> 00:22:09,156
want.

639
00:22:09,866 --> 00:22:11,696
For instance, we can change the

640
00:22:11,696 --> 00:22:14,306
sound of the space bar, of the

641
00:22:14,306 --> 00:22:16,006

00:22:33,536 --> 00:22:36,086
a bit more playful and not so

00:22:37,596 --> 00:22:39,186
And we do another thing.

649
00:22:39,186 --> 00:22:41,226
When you type faster, we bring

650
00:22:41,226 --> 00:22:42,686
down the volume of the sound

00:22:45,086 --> 00:22:46,176
It's not something that you may

653
00:22:46,176 --> 00:22:48,256
hear in everyday use, but even

654
00:22:48,256 --> 00:22:50,066
these little things make a

a solid, safe Home button.

670
00:23:30,396 --> 00:23:31,506
It's durable, and it's

674
00:23:35,426 --> 00:23:38,296
So we used the Taptic Engine to

675
00:23:38,296 --> 00:23:40,426
create this button experience,

676
00:23:41,416 --> 00:23:42,816
and we learned while designing

677
00:23:42,816 --> 00:23:45,016
for the watch that combining

678
00:23:45,016 --> 00:23:47,196
sounds and haptics the right way

679
00:23:47,196 --> 00:23:48,716
and synchronizing them

680
00:23:48,716 --> 00:23:50,416
precisely, we can come up with

00:23:50,416 --> 00:23:52,746
this great multisensory

00:23:54,276 --> 00:23:55,386
for a similar experience for

684
00:23:55,386 --> 00:23:58,416

00:23:58,416 --> 00:24:00,656
add a very subtle, quiet "click"

766
00:26:25,076 --> 00:26:26,186
people have their phones in

767
00:26:26,186 --> 00:26:26,946
their hands.

777
00:26:51,456 --> 00:26:52,906
like to give you some tips and

778
00:26:52,906 --> 00:26:55,036
techniques to keep in mind when

779
00:26:55,036 --> 00:26:56,766
you're working on your own app.

780
00:26:58,736 --> 00:27:01,956
First of all, keep sound in mind

781
00:26:58,736 --> 00:27:01,956
First of all, keep sound in mind

782
00:27:01,956 --> 00:27:02,686
from the start.

783
00:27:03,516 --> 00:27:04,496
When you're beginning your

784
00:27:04,496 --> 00:27:06,236
project, you can ask yourself

785
00:27:06,236 --> 00:27:07,226
these questions.

786
00:27:07,846 --> 00:27:09,026
Will my app send frequent

787
00:27:09,026 --> 00:27:10,086
notifications?

788
00:27:10,086 --> 00:27:11,916
If this is the case, it makes a

789
00:27:11,916 --> 00:27:13,166
lot of sense to think about

790
00:27:13,166 --> 00:27:14,406
creating your own notification

791
00:27:14,406 --> 00:27:14,816
sound.

792
00:27:16,456 --> 00:27:18,506
Can sound play a role in my

793
00:27:18,506 --> 00:27:19,376
app's branding?

794
00:27:20,156 --> 00:27:22,486
Well, if the answer to the first

795
00:27:22,486 --> 00:27:25,366
question is yes, and you do

796
00:27:25,366 --> 00:27:27,026
create your own sound, then it's

797
00:27:27,056 --> 00:27:28,146
already playing a role.

798
00:27:28,866 --> 00:27:31,026
You're already creating a voice

799
00:27:31,026 --> 00:27:31,676
for your brand.

800
00:27:34,046 --> 00:27:36,596
Now how can the UI benefit from

801
00:27:36,596 --> 00:27:37,606
an audible component?

802
00:27:37,956 --> 00:27:39,796
Is there any way you can help

803
00:27:39,796 --> 00:27:40,926
people understand what's going

804
00:27:40,926 --> 00:27:42,296
on on the screen by adding some

805
00:27:42,626 --> 00:27:44,406
subtle sounds to it?

806
00:27:44,656 --> 00:27:47,296
And then how would I understand

807
00:27:47,296 --> 00:27:48,766

808
00:27:48,766 --> 00:27:49,426

809
00:27:50,076 --> 00:27:51,266
The question I started out with.

810
00:27:51,266 --> 00:27:53,706
Of course, you don't have to use

811
00:27:53,706 --> 00:27:55,036
your app without looking at it,

812
00:27:55,326 --> 00:27:57,206
but it's an interesting question

813
00:27:57,206 --> 00:27:58,216
to help yourself, and it may

814
00:27:58,216 --> 00:27:59,826

Now, of course, if you're

843
00:29:05,756 --> 00:29:08,066
But we don't want every app to

844
00:29:08,066 --> 00:29:08,956
sound like a game.

845
00:29:11,096 --> 00:29:13,226
Now if you do add UI sounds,

846
00:29:13,226 --> 00:29:14,636
also add the option for people

don't like the way it sounds.

853
00:29:23,736 --> 00:29:25,586
So be very careful when adding

these sounds.

855
00:29:26,216 --> 00:29:28,386

Here's some things to keep in

mind, especially when designing

If I'm listening to music, and

00:29:50,516 --> 00:29:53,446
in, the music ducks, which is

868
00:29:53,446 --> 00:29:54,886
fine because I choose to get

00:29:54,886 --> 00:29:55,916
these notifications.

00:30:05,596 --> 00:30:06,826
So ask yourself the question,

877
00:30:07,316 --> 00:30:08,356
does it get in the way of the

00:32:35,626 --> 00:32:37,316
So if you're inventive, you can

956
00:32:37,316 --> 00:32:38,566
come a long way with a simple

957
00:32:38,566 --> 00:32:42,306
tool like Garage Band as well.

958
00:32:42,726 --> 00:32:43,926
Also pay attention to the

959
00:32:43,926 --> 00:32:45,016
frequencies you're playing.

960
00:32:45,366 --> 00:32:47,866
The iPhone speaker is a

961
00:32:47,866 --> 00:32:49,896
wonderful speaker, but there are

962
00:32:49,896 --> 00:32:51,256
some physical limitations,

963
00:32:51,616 --> 00:32:53,146
especially low frequencies.

964
00:32:53,226 --> 00:32:55,076
It may not translate that well,

965
00:32:55,076 --> 00:32:57,746
so it makes sense to filter out

966
00:32:57,746 --> 00:32:59,046
those frequencies that you don't

967
00:32:59,046 --> 00:32:59,706
use.

968
00:33:00,096 --> 00:33:01,296
This will clean up the sound and

969
00:33:01,296 --> 00:33:02,386
makes it sound more clear.

970
00:33:03,636 --> 00:33:05,486
How do you find out what works

971
00:33:05,486 --> 00:33:06,236
and what doesn't work?

972
00:33:06,866 --> 00:33:09,596
Just test it out on the device

973
00:33:09,596 --> 00:33:10,456
that it's going to be played

974
00:33:10,456 --> 00:33:10,766
upon.

975
00:33:11,736 --> 00:33:14,266
So if you're creating a game

976
00:33:14,596 --> 00:33:16,676
that will run on iPhone as well

977
00:33:16,676 --> 00:33:18,486
as on iPad, then test out the

978
00:33:18,486 --> 00:33:20,746
sounds on the iPhone as well as

979
00:33:20,746 --> 00:33:23,086
on the iPad, and realize that

980
00:33:23,086 --> 00:33:23,906
people will be wearing

981
00:33:23,906 --> 00:33:26,206
headphones, so also test it out

982
00:33:26,206 --> 00:33:26,946
for headphones.

983
00:33:28,736 --> 00:33:31,816
Now when you're done exploring

984
00:33:32,246 --> 00:33:34,736
and done prototyping, maybe it's

985
00:33:34,736 --> 00:33:35,976
time to work with an expert.

986
00:33:36,546 --> 00:33:37,636
It's time to get serious.

987
00:33:38,566 --> 00:33:40,716
So a sound designer can help you

988
00:33:41,016 --> 00:33:42,206
come with an overall sound

989
00:33:42,206 --> 00:33:44,346
concept and help you design the

990
00:33:44,346 --> 00:33:46,856
sounds, and a sound engineer can

991
00:33:46,856 --> 00:33:48,296
help you clean these sounds up

992
00:33:48,466 --> 00:33:50,476
and make them ready for everyday

993
00:33:50,476 --> 00:33:50,956
use.

994
00:33:53,546 --> 00:33:56,606
Now we all know this guy, and

995
00:33:56,946 --> 00:33:58,966
even I have to admit I use it

996
00:33:58,966 --> 00:33:59,436
now and then.

997
00:34:01,056 --> 00:34:04,436
Our goal is not for everyone to

998
00:34:04,436 --> 00:34:05,916
leave their sound on all the

999
00:34:05,916 --> 00:34:07,066
time, everywhere they go.

1000
00:34:08,376 --> 00:34:11,016
But when we start hearing more

1001
00:34:11,016 --> 00:34:12,696
and more wonderful notifications

1002
00:34:13,315 --> 00:34:16,416
and UI sounds that help our

1003
00:34:16,416 --> 00:34:19,045
users and delight our users,

1004
00:34:19,636 --> 00:34:23,206
then maybe, just maybe, you'll

1005
00:34:23,206 --> 00:34:24,616
start seeing people reach for it

1006
00:34:25,926 --> 00:34:26,666
a little less.

1007
00:34:27,396 --> 00:34:28,856
That will be awesome.

1008
00:34:28,856 --> 00:34:30,775
Thanks for listening to me

1009
00:34:30,775 --> 00:34:30,976
today.
