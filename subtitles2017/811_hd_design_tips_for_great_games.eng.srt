1
00:00:22,046 --> 00:00:23,126
&gt;&gt; From first launch to your

2
00:00:23,126 --> 00:00:24,486
tutorial through your user

3
00:00:24,486 --> 00:00:26,356
interface, there's a lot that

4
00:00:26,356 --> 00:00:28,056
people experience in addition to

5
00:00:28,056 --> 00:00:29,216
your game's gameplay.

6
00:00:29,816 --> 00:00:31,076
So, in the next few minutes, I'm

7
00:00:31,076 --> 00:00:33,206
going to cover 10 design tips to

8
00:00:33,206 --> 00:00:36,156
create great experiences as soon

9
00:00:36,156 --> 00:00:37,826
as someone taps your app icon.

10
00:00:38,886 --> 00:00:40,246
And many of these tips can be

11
00:00:40,246 --> 00:00:41,826
applied to apps that are looking

12
00:00:41,826 --> 00:00:43,096
to be just as immersive,

13
00:00:43,366 --> 00:00:44,756
engaging, and fun.

14
00:00:45,406 --> 00:00:46,166
So, let's start.

15
00:00:46,576 --> 00:00:48,676
First up is first Launch.

16
00:00:49,606 --> 00:00:51,066
This is the first experience

17
00:00:51,106 --> 00:00:53,046
people have with your game and

18
00:00:53,046 --> 00:00:54,486
your first impression matters.

19
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:56,086
So, no matter what you need to

20
00:00:56,086 --> 00:00:57,716
say first, whether it is Accept

21
00:00:57,816 --> 00:01:00,196
Terms, or Headsets Recommended,

22
00:00:57,816 --> 00:01:00,196
Terms, or Headsets Recommended,

23
00:01:00,796 --> 00:01:02,276
design the first screen to fit

24
00:01:02,276 --> 00:01:03,796
within the style of your game.

25
00:01:04,666 --> 00:01:05,786
That way, they're immersed

26
00:01:05,786 --> 00:01:06,596
immediately.

27
00:01:07,216 --> 00:01:08,666
This edge to edge illustration

28
00:01:08,666 --> 00:01:10,426
from Pokemon Go does a great

29
00:01:10,426 --> 00:01:12,526
job, and it communicates just as

30
00:01:12,526 --> 00:01:14,156
much as the text on screen.

31
00:01:15,326 --> 00:01:17,266
So, take the time to design what

32
00:01:17,266 --> 00:01:18,746
people see first as soon as they

33
00:01:18,746 --> 00:01:19,556
launch your game.

34
00:01:20,156 --> 00:01:21,636
When this is done well, it'll

35
00:01:21,636 --> 00:01:23,026
make a lasting impression and

36
00:01:23,026 --> 00:01:24,256
set the tone for the rest of

37
00:01:24,256 --> 00:01:24,766
your game.

38
00:01:26,036 --> 00:01:28,086
Next, is Loading because

39
00:01:28,086 --> 00:01:29,526
sometimes it takes just a few

40
00:01:29,526 --> 00:01:30,946
seconds to pull data through

41
00:01:30,946 --> 00:01:31,546
space.

42
00:01:32,256 --> 00:01:33,706
So, why not take advantage of

43
00:01:33,706 --> 00:01:35,056
what we all know to be true,

44
00:01:35,906 --> 00:01:37,526
time flies when you're having

45
00:01:37,526 --> 00:01:37,936
fun.

46
00:01:38,596 --> 00:01:40,766
So, during Loading, make it fun

47
00:01:40,766 --> 00:01:42,706
by educating or entertaining;

48
00:01:43,086 --> 00:01:44,616
then, Loading won't see to take

49
00:01:44,616 --> 00:01:45,216
as long.

50
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:48,286
This is Don't Starve Pocket

51
00:01:48,286 --> 00:01:50,156
Edition, and in this game

52
00:01:50,396 --> 00:01:51,766
Loading is masked by this

53
00:01:51,766 --> 00:01:53,466
beautifully creepy animation,

54
00:01:53,976 --> 00:01:55,476
players are entertained, and

55
00:01:55,546 --> 00:01:56,986
time seems to fly by.

56
00:01:58,396 --> 00:02:00,546
Loading is also a great time to

57
00:01:58,396 --> 00:02:00,546
Loading is also a great time to

58
00:02:00,546 --> 00:02:01,006
educate.

59
00:02:01,566 --> 00:02:03,326
In Clash Royale, as you prepare

60
00:02:03,326 --> 00:02:05,466
for battle, a gameplay tip is

61
00:02:05,466 --> 00:02:06,486
shown on screen.

62
00:02:07,096 --> 00:02:08,455
Now, if you choose to do this,

63
00:02:08,846 --> 00:02:10,036
make sure that players have

64
00:02:10,036 --> 00:02:12,366
enough time to read the tip and

65
00:02:12,366 --> 00:02:13,926
also be intelligent about what

66
00:02:13,926 --> 00:02:14,676
you show people.

67
00:02:15,026 --> 00:02:16,396
If someone's already seen a tip,

68
00:02:16,536 --> 00:02:17,846
don't repeat it in the same

69
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:18,396
session.

70
00:02:19,196 --> 00:02:20,686
And finally, to show Loading

71
00:02:20,686 --> 00:02:22,826
progress, always favor progress

72
00:02:22,826 --> 00:02:24,656
bars over activity indicators

73
00:02:24,996 --> 00:02:26,126
because they do a much better

74
00:02:26,126 --> 00:02:27,336
job communicating what's

75
00:02:27,336 --> 00:02:28,946
happening and how long it will

76
00:02:28,946 --> 00:02:29,276
take.

77
00:02:30,076 --> 00:02:31,156
So, no matter when your game

78
00:02:31,156 --> 00:02:33,476
needs to load, entertain,

79
00:02:34,066 --> 00:02:35,946
educate, and show progress.

80
00:02:37,396 --> 00:02:39,636
All right, next is Quick Start.

81
00:02:40,246 --> 00:02:41,896
Being able to start quickly and

82
00:02:41,896 --> 00:02:43,846
jump into your game is key to a

83
00:02:43,846 --> 00:02:45,286
great game experience.

84
00:02:46,096 --> 00:02:47,976
This is INKS, and it's an Apple

85
00:02:47,976 --> 00:02:49,516
Design Award winner from last

86
00:02:49,516 --> 00:02:49,776
year.

87
00:02:50,356 --> 00:02:51,716
It's really fun that you're able

88
00:02:51,716 --> 00:02:53,146
to get a feeling for the game

89
00:02:53,146 --> 00:02:55,106
right from launch, but also they

90
00:02:55,106 --> 00:02:56,876
do a great job making it obvious

91
00:02:56,876 --> 00:02:58,216
on how to start the game with

92
00:02:58,216 --> 00:02:59,566
this large turquoise Play

93
00:02:59,566 --> 00:02:59,936
button.

94
00:03:00,566 --> 00:03:02,306
And as soon as you tap it, there

95
00:03:02,306 --> 00:03:03,926
are only two screens before

96
00:03:03,926 --> 00:03:05,456
you're in and playing the game,

97
00:03:05,876 --> 00:03:06,766
which is awesome.

98
00:03:07,386 --> 00:03:08,696
So, let people get into your

99
00:03:08,696 --> 00:03:10,686
game easily and quickly.

100
00:03:11,606 --> 00:03:13,016
Don't ask players to make too

101
00:03:13,016 --> 00:03:14,146
many choices before they

102
00:03:14,146 --> 00:03:15,706
understand what it means in your

103
00:03:15,706 --> 00:03:16,116
game.

104
00:03:17,156 --> 00:03:18,846
And for more complex games, I

105
00:03:18,846 --> 00:03:19,956
know there are important things

106
00:03:19,956 --> 00:03:20,756
that you want to show your

107
00:03:20,756 --> 00:03:21,196
players.

108
00:03:22,246 --> 00:03:23,756
And game Main Menus have become

109
00:03:23,756 --> 00:03:25,656
increasingly busy with news,

110
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:28,226
tournaments, stores, and more.

111
00:03:28,716 --> 00:03:29,896
And these can all be on your

112
00:03:29,896 --> 00:03:31,906
interface, but make sure that

113
00:03:31,906 --> 00:03:34,396
the main call to action to play,

114
00:03:35,026 --> 00:03:37,386
start, battle, or begin a new

115
00:03:37,386 --> 00:03:39,496
game is the most dominant in

116
00:03:39,496 --> 00:03:40,426
your Main Menu UI.

117
00:03:41,636 --> 00:03:44,716
All right, tip 4 is all about

118
00:03:44,716 --> 00:03:46,236
our game's interface, and before

119
00:03:46,236 --> 00:03:47,876
we jump into this tip, you

120
00:03:47,876 --> 00:03:49,456
should know something about me,

121
00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:52,336
and that's, I have a soft spot

122
00:03:52,336 --> 00:03:53,636
for classic arcade games.

123
00:03:54,206 --> 00:03:56,756
So, this fake alien monster game

124
00:03:56,756 --> 00:03:58,166
is going to help us with a few

125
00:03:58,166 --> 00:03:59,946
user interface best practices,

126
00:04:00,516 --> 00:04:02,486
starting with consistency.

127
00:04:04,076 --> 00:04:06,536
Consistency improves usability

128
00:04:06,936 --> 00:04:08,536
because it helps people mentally

129
00:04:08,536 --> 00:04:09,486
map your interface.

130
00:04:09,986 --> 00:04:12,056
It's much easier to play and

131
00:04:12,056 --> 00:04:13,406
navigate when controls are in

132
00:04:13,406 --> 00:04:14,536
predictable locations.

133
00:04:15,156 --> 00:04:16,766
So, be consistent in the layout

134
00:04:16,766 --> 00:04:17,856
of your game's menu.

135
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:19,726
That way, people can spend their

136
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:21,625
energy playing your game versus

137
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:23,516
trying to recall where was that

138
00:04:23,516 --> 00:04:24,246
Settings button.

139
00:04:25,006 --> 00:04:26,246
So, let's look at this exact

140
00:04:26,346 --> 00:04:28,256
same flow with an inconsistent

141
00:04:28,256 --> 00:04:28,436
UI.

142
00:04:30,116 --> 00:04:31,796
The Back button is all over the

143
00:04:31,796 --> 00:04:34,136
place, and Settings disappears

144
00:04:34,136 --> 00:04:35,686
on the Choose Character screen.

145
00:04:36,946 --> 00:04:38,936
This inconsistency disrupts a

146
00:04:38,936 --> 00:04:41,156
player's experience because it

147
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:42,686
takes more effort to mentally

148
00:04:42,686 --> 00:04:43,526
map the interface.

149
00:04:44,246 --> 00:04:45,636
So, when you're designing, to

150
00:04:45,636 --> 00:04:47,356
accommodate for consistency, lay

151
00:04:47,356 --> 00:04:49,116
out all of your screens and

152
00:04:49,116 --> 00:04:49,716
check them.

153
00:04:50,026 --> 00:04:51,426
That way, you'll be able to tell

154
00:04:51,426 --> 00:04:52,696
whether the controls are in the

155
00:04:52,696 --> 00:04:53,256
same place.

156
00:04:54,756 --> 00:04:57,106
Okay. The next UI best practice

157
00:04:57,106 --> 00:04:58,426
is all about clarity.

158
00:04:59,386 --> 00:05:00,736
It needs to be clear to players

159
00:04:59,386 --> 00:05:00,736
It needs to be clear to players

160
00:05:00,736 --> 00:05:02,056
what's interactive and what's

161
00:05:02,096 --> 00:05:02,456
not.

162
00:05:02,836 --> 00:05:04,206
If people have to think too much

163
00:05:04,206 --> 00:05:05,936
about what to tap, they're going

164
00:05:05,936 --> 00:05:06,996
to be taken out of your game's

165
00:05:06,996 --> 00:05:07,686
experience.

166
00:05:08,736 --> 00:05:10,596
So, items that are tappable need

167
00:05:10,596 --> 00:05:11,536
to look different from items

168
00:05:11,536 --> 00:05:12,466
that are not tappable.

169
00:05:13,226 --> 00:05:14,556
So, in the top center of this

170
00:05:14,556 --> 00:05:17,016
screen, my Lives is actually

171
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:18,796
just status, but with this

172
00:05:18,796 --> 00:05:20,096
visual appearance, it could be

173
00:05:20,096 --> 00:05:21,466
confused for something that's

174
00:05:21,466 --> 00:05:22,096
interactive.

175
00:05:22,726 --> 00:05:23,896
This is common in a lot of

176
00:05:23,896 --> 00:05:25,456
games, and there is an easy fix.

177
00:05:26,296 --> 00:05:27,776
Make non-interactive elements

178
00:05:27,776 --> 00:05:29,336
look different by using color

179
00:05:29,336 --> 00:05:32,026
and shape, like this or this.

180
00:05:32,676 --> 00:05:34,836
Or you can remove and put status

181
00:05:34,836 --> 00:05:36,506
items away from interactive

182
00:05:36,506 --> 00:05:37,056
elements.

183
00:05:38,286 --> 00:05:39,836
In your interface, for clarity,

184
00:05:39,836 --> 00:05:41,726
it's important always to include

185
00:05:41,726 --> 00:05:43,776
three visual states for buttons

186
00:05:43,826 --> 00:05:46,186
and controls because a lack of

187
00:05:46,186 --> 00:05:47,506
visual feedback can confuse

188
00:05:47,506 --> 00:05:48,016
players.

189
00:05:48,966 --> 00:05:50,746
Be sure to use a Normal state to

190
00:05:50,746 --> 00:05:51,736
show people that something's

191
00:05:51,736 --> 00:05:52,276
tappable.

192
00:05:52,966 --> 00:05:54,986
Use a Press state when something

193
00:05:54,986 --> 00:05:56,486
has been tapped.

194
00:05:56,486 --> 00:05:58,066
And finally, use a Disabled

195
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,416
state for control that's not

196
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:01,156
currently active or enabled.

197
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:01,156
currently active or enabled.

198
00:06:02,636 --> 00:06:04,246
Many developers struggle if they

199
00:06:04,246 --> 00:06:06,246
should remove or hide a control

200
00:06:06,246 --> 00:06:08,506
if it cannot be activated, but

201
00:06:08,506 --> 00:06:10,546
if you do that, when it does pop

202
00:06:10,876 --> 00:06:11,706
back it could be really

203
00:06:11,706 --> 00:06:13,976
confusing to players, especially

204
00:06:13,976 --> 00:06:15,366
if this happens during gameplay.

205
00:06:16,316 --> 00:06:17,916
So, for a much better user

206
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:19,536
experience, use a Disabled

207
00:06:19,536 --> 00:06:19,916
state.

208
00:06:20,586 --> 00:06:21,586
This lets people know the

209
00:06:21,586 --> 00:06:23,706
control's location and action

210
00:06:23,706 --> 00:06:25,146
that will be possible soon when

211
00:06:25,146 --> 00:06:26,356
that control is enabled.

212
00:06:27,296 --> 00:06:28,826
And finally, make sure that

213
00:06:28,826 --> 00:06:30,346
everything that's interactive on

214
00:06:30,346 --> 00:06:31,726
your game's interface meets the

215
00:06:31,726 --> 00:06:34,216
minimum tap targets on iOS which

216
00:06:34,216 --> 00:06:35,986
is 44 by 44 points.

217
00:06:37,186 --> 00:06:39,056
Your interface is a tool to make

218
00:06:39,056 --> 00:06:41,236
sense of your game's world, so

219
00:06:41,236 --> 00:06:42,946
make it consistent and clear.

220
00:06:43,386 --> 00:06:44,776
That way, people will be able to

221
00:06:44,776 --> 00:06:46,396
stay engaged in your game.

222
00:06:47,106 --> 00:06:48,816
All right, I hope you all enjoy

223
00:06:48,816 --> 00:06:50,196
that fake alien monster game.

224
00:06:50,196 --> 00:06:51,656
It'll come back in a bit to help

225
00:06:51,656 --> 00:06:54,696
us with a few other design tips.

226
00:06:54,866 --> 00:06:56,646
We're already halfway through at

227
00:06:56,646 --> 00:06:57,406
number 5.

228
00:06:58,066 --> 00:06:59,576
This tip and the next few are

229
00:06:59,576 --> 00:07:00,946
about game tutorials.

230
00:06:59,576 --> 00:07:00,946
about game tutorials.

231
00:07:01,716 --> 00:07:03,276
Successful tutorials teach

232
00:07:03,276 --> 00:07:04,996
gradually and in context through

233
00:07:04,996 --> 00:07:06,066
progressive disclosure.

234
00:07:07,056 --> 00:07:08,366
Your tutorial should be made up

235
00:07:08,366 --> 00:07:10,446
of three basic parts that align

236
00:07:10,446 --> 00:07:12,096
to the core loop of your game.

237
00:07:12,716 --> 00:07:14,846
For example, it might be that

238
00:07:14,846 --> 00:07:16,786
you have to fight monsters to

239
00:07:16,786 --> 00:07:18,706
get some gold, and then buy some

240
00:07:18,706 --> 00:07:20,786
stuff to fight more challenging

241
00:07:20,786 --> 00:07:21,316
monsters.

242
00:07:22,136 --> 00:07:24,686
But be sure, in your tutorial,

243
00:07:24,686 --> 00:07:26,526
it stays to those three basic

244
00:07:26,526 --> 00:07:27,046
parts.

245
00:07:27,806 --> 00:07:29,576
If you have to keep, if you have

246
00:07:29,576 --> 00:07:31,286
to teach about economy in your

247
00:07:31,286 --> 00:07:34,016
game, keep it simple because

248
00:07:34,016 --> 00:07:35,326
remember you're teaching

249
00:07:35,326 --> 00:07:36,856
somebody something brand new.

250
00:07:37,496 --> 00:07:39,956
So, avoid overwhelming people

251
00:07:39,956 --> 00:07:41,266
and including information in

252
00:07:41,266 --> 00:07:42,596
your tutorial that is not

253
00:07:42,596 --> 00:07:43,706
essential to gameplay.

254
00:07:44,676 --> 00:07:47,066
All of this, such as upgrades,

255
00:07:47,206 --> 00:07:48,826
tournaments, messages, and your

256
00:07:48,826 --> 00:07:51,056
store can all be discovered

257
00:07:51,276 --> 00:07:52,176
after your tutorial.

258
00:07:53,366 --> 00:07:55,006
And also, in your tutorial it's

259
00:07:55,006 --> 00:07:56,446
really important to provide

260
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:57,666
clear direction.

261
00:07:58,256 --> 00:07:59,926
If you have characters in your

262
00:07:59,926 --> 00:08:01,856
game, it's pretty common to have

263
00:07:59,926 --> 00:08:01,856
game, it's pretty common to have

264
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:03,346
a character walk you through the

265
00:08:03,346 --> 00:08:03,966
tutorial.

266
00:08:04,856 --> 00:08:06,216
So, let's say we have this

267
00:08:06,216 --> 00:08:09,256
adorable alien monster, keep

268
00:08:09,256 --> 00:08:11,406
directions short and simple to

269
00:08:11,406 --> 00:08:12,086
be effective.

270
00:08:13,156 --> 00:08:14,166
So, whether you teach with a

271
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:16,676
character or through in-game

272
00:08:16,676 --> 00:08:18,636
instructional text, a single

273
00:08:18,636 --> 00:08:19,816
clear direction is going to be

274
00:08:19,816 --> 00:08:20,776
the most effective.

275
00:08:21,696 --> 00:08:23,406
And please, don't repeat

276
00:08:23,406 --> 00:08:24,096
directions.

277
00:08:24,766 --> 00:08:26,776
Respect your players and treat,

278
00:08:26,776 --> 00:08:27,906
and don't treat them like

279
00:08:27,906 --> 00:08:28,456
children.

280
00:08:29,236 --> 00:08:30,566
Even if your players are

281
00:08:30,566 --> 00:08:31,876
children, kids are smart.

282
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:34,096
So, repeating directions

283
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:35,916
unnecessarily lengthens your

284
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:38,025
tutorial, and that makes it less

285
00:08:38,025 --> 00:08:39,466
effective and less fun.

286
00:08:40,466 --> 00:08:42,076
And learning is really fun,

287
00:08:42,116 --> 00:08:43,416
especially when the teacher is

288
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:45,956
engaging, creative, and

289
00:08:45,956 --> 00:08:46,596
inventive.

290
00:08:47,316 --> 00:08:48,726
So, be the cool teacher.

291
00:08:49,106 --> 00:08:50,566
Don't just do what you've seen

292
00:08:50,566 --> 00:08:51,216
others do.

293
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:53,226
If your game is unique, your

294
00:08:53,226 --> 00:08:54,406
tutorial should be too.

295
00:08:55,516 --> 00:08:57,166
For example, think about how you

296
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:58,736
can teach before your game

297
00:08:58,736 --> 00:08:59,266
begins.

298
00:09:00,506 --> 00:09:02,506
This is Splitter Critters, and

299
00:09:02,506 --> 00:09:04,556
in this game you split the world

300
00:09:04,556 --> 00:09:06,166
with a swipe of your finger and

301
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:07,326
then rearrange it to guide

302
00:09:07,326 --> 00:09:08,216
critters back to their

303
00:09:08,216 --> 00:09:08,786
spaceship.

304
00:09:09,326 --> 00:09:10,656
And from the Start screen,

305
00:09:10,866 --> 00:09:12,216
you're taught this key game

306
00:09:12,216 --> 00:09:12,776
mechanic.

307
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:15,436
And one of the least effective

308
00:09:15,436 --> 00:09:17,296
ways to teach is with a bouncing

309
00:09:17,296 --> 00:09:17,706
arrow.

310
00:09:18,406 --> 00:09:21,256
It's not effective because

311
00:09:21,306 --> 00:09:22,616
people just end up playing tap

312
00:09:22,786 --> 00:09:24,286
the pointing arrow game and not

313
00:09:24,286 --> 00:09:24,756
learning.

314
00:09:25,426 --> 00:09:26,946
And the same goes for the

315
00:09:26,946 --> 00:09:27,666
floating hand.

316
00:09:28,476 --> 00:09:30,166
Not only do you not learn, but

317
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:31,226
this method is really

318
00:09:31,226 --> 00:09:32,846
problematic because it hides you

319
00:09:32,846 --> 00:09:33,866
from the interface that you're

320
00:09:33,866 --> 00:09:35,366
trying to be learning about.

321
00:09:36,196 --> 00:09:37,706
So, there are much better

322
00:09:37,706 --> 00:09:39,136
attention-getting devices that

323
00:09:39,136 --> 00:09:40,456
are way more natural and

324
00:09:40,456 --> 00:09:42,716
immersive, such as animation.

325
00:09:44,076 --> 00:09:46,676
This is Reigns, and I was really

326
00:09:46,676 --> 00:09:47,736
excited to hear that the

327
00:09:47,736 --> 00:09:49,496
developer is soon updating to

328
00:09:49,496 --> 00:09:50,746
remove the floating hand.

329
00:09:51,926 --> 00:09:53,496
On the right, is the new

330
00:09:53,496 --> 00:09:55,296
experience and, as you can see,

331
00:09:55,296 --> 00:09:57,216
it's much more immersive; it's

332
00:09:57,216 --> 00:09:59,086
just as effective, and it does a

333
00:09:59,086 --> 00:10:00,816
great job getting you right into

334
00:09:59,086 --> 00:10:00,816
great job getting you right into

335
00:10:00,816 --> 00:10:01,886
the world of Reigns.

336
00:10:02,736 --> 00:10:04,306
And being in the world of your

337
00:10:04,306 --> 00:10:05,756
game is the best.

338
00:10:06,726 --> 00:10:08,456
So, if you can let people jump

339
00:10:08,536 --> 00:10:10,786
right in and learn through play,

340
00:10:10,846 --> 00:10:12,466
that is going to be the most

341
00:10:12,466 --> 00:10:14,306
effective way to teach them your

342
00:10:14,306 --> 00:10:14,716
game.

343
00:10:15,306 --> 00:10:18,336
So, this is Mars: Mars on Apple

344
00:10:18,336 --> 00:10:18,736
TV.

345
00:10:19,636 --> 00:10:20,966
And it is really fun to be able

346
00:10:20,966 --> 00:10:22,266
to jump right into the game.

347
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:24,866
So right now, I'm on Mars, and

348
00:10:24,866 --> 00:10:26,066
the controls are intuitive, so

349
00:10:26,066 --> 00:10:26,886
I'm going to start clicking

350
00:10:26,886 --> 00:10:27,366
around.

351
00:10:27,936 --> 00:10:31,496
And after one hilarious death, I

352
00:10:31,496 --> 00:10:32,656
quickly realize that the

353
00:10:32,656 --> 00:10:34,896
objective is to land safely on

354
00:10:34,896 --> 00:10:35,616
the stations.

355
00:10:36,586 --> 00:10:38,066
So, for the best experience,

356
00:10:38,536 --> 00:10:40,986
teach people through play.

357
00:10:41,676 --> 00:10:44,896
All right, we're already at

358
00:10:44,896 --> 00:10:47,326
number 9, which is all about

359
00:10:47,326 --> 00:10:48,916
letting people skip and get

360
00:10:48,986 --> 00:10:50,096
right into your game.

361
00:10:51,046 --> 00:10:52,866
Give the player control, and

362
00:10:52,866 --> 00:10:54,886
that way Skip can create a much

363
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:56,346
better user experience.

364
00:10:57,976 --> 00:10:59,316
Now, I love this opening

365
00:10:59,316 --> 00:11:00,956
sequence from Icycle: On Thin

366
00:10:59,316 --> 00:11:00,956
sequence from Icycle: On Thin

367
00:11:01,006 --> 00:11:01,486
Ice.

368
00:11:01,926 --> 00:11:03,666
It's clever, has a striking

369
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:05,076
style, and it provides you with

370
00:11:05,076 --> 00:11:06,296
the motivation of the main

371
00:11:06,296 --> 00:11:07,666
character, Dennis.

372
00:11:08,366 --> 00:11:09,906
But when you tap on the screen,

373
00:11:09,976 --> 00:11:11,516
a very subtle Skip button

374
00:11:11,516 --> 00:11:11,986
appears.

375
00:11:12,096 --> 00:11:14,846
And that is great because

376
00:11:14,846 --> 00:11:16,906
revealing Skip on tap is a

377
00:11:16,906 --> 00:11:17,856
wonderful technique.

378
00:11:18,566 --> 00:11:20,006
Players who are ready to jump

379
00:11:20,006 --> 00:11:22,086
right into your game can, and

380
00:11:22,086 --> 00:11:23,266
people who want to watch the

381
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:24,806
entire sequence can stay

382
00:11:24,806 --> 00:11:25,936
immersed with edge to edge

383
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:26,296
playback.

384
00:11:27,786 --> 00:11:29,936
Now, letting players Skip also

385
00:11:29,936 --> 00:11:31,636
applies to tutorials.

386
00:11:32,686 --> 00:11:34,936
This is Zombie Gunship, and

387
00:11:34,936 --> 00:11:36,076
check out the upper left-hand

388
00:11:36,076 --> 00:11:36,476
corner.

389
00:11:36,876 --> 00:11:37,786
It's awesome.

390
00:11:37,786 --> 00:11:39,366
There is a Skip Tutorial button,

391
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:41,036
and it feels great to be able to

392
00:11:41,036 --> 00:11:42,396
jump right into the game.

393
00:11:43,976 --> 00:11:45,556
Just be sure if you allow people

394
00:11:45,556 --> 00:11:47,366
to Skip your tutorial, they're

395
00:11:47,366 --> 00:11:49,286
able to relaunch or replay the

396
00:11:49,286 --> 00:11:50,736
tutorial in case they need a

397
00:11:50,736 --> 00:11:51,816
refresher on the rules.

398
00:11:52,376 --> 00:11:54,316
Now, I understand that this may

399
00:11:54,316 --> 00:11:55,786
not work for every game.

400
00:11:56,226 --> 00:11:57,506
So, if it's critical to your

401
00:11:57,506 --> 00:11:59,336
game's progression to include a

402
00:11:59,336 --> 00:12:01,186
tutorial level, teach the

403
00:11:59,336 --> 00:12:01,186
tutorial level, teach the

404
00:12:01,186 --> 00:12:03,786
basics, gradually adding context

405
00:12:03,786 --> 00:12:05,006
through progressive disclosure,

406
00:12:05,396 --> 00:12:06,636
and then get out of the way.

407
00:12:08,346 --> 00:12:10,296
Letting players Skip is about

408
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:11,906
putting the player's experience

409
00:12:12,116 --> 00:12:14,316
first because you don't know

410
00:12:14,616 --> 00:12:17,116
someone's skill level or how

411
00:12:17,116 --> 00:12:18,576
much time they have to play your

412
00:12:18,576 --> 00:12:18,996
game.

413
00:12:19,996 --> 00:12:22,416
And I'm sure we have all button

414
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:24,016
smashed and clicked as quickly

415
00:12:24,016 --> 00:12:25,216
as possible to get through a

416
00:12:25,216 --> 00:12:26,646
tutorial just to get into the

417
00:12:26,646 --> 00:12:27,066
game.

418
00:12:27,766 --> 00:12:29,166
So, for a much better user

419
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:31,786
experience, provide a Skip

420
00:12:31,786 --> 00:12:32,626
Tutorial button.

421
00:12:33,386 --> 00:12:36,776
So, respect the player and that

422
00:12:36,776 --> 00:12:38,556
way, they will be able to have a

423
00:12:38,556 --> 00:12:40,066
much better user experience.

424
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:43,916
The final design tip today is

425
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:45,426
about being inclusive.

426
00:12:46,356 --> 00:12:48,286
There's a lot that you can do to

427
00:12:48,286 --> 00:12:50,356
make your game more accessible,

428
00:12:50,826 --> 00:12:52,336
such as adding Closed Captions

429
00:12:52,546 --> 00:12:53,936
or supporting Dynamic Type.

430
00:12:54,746 --> 00:12:56,606
You can also, just like in

431
00:12:56,606 --> 00:12:59,606
Mushroom 11, support Left and

432
00:12:59,606 --> 00:13:02,206
Right-Hand Mode, or you can

433
00:12:59,606 --> 00:13:02,206
Right-Hand Mode, or you can

434
00:13:02,206 --> 00:13:03,816
support Color Blind Mode, like

435
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:04,726
in KAMI 2.

436
00:13:05,336 --> 00:13:06,586
And one of the coolest

437
00:13:06,586 --> 00:13:07,896
Accessibility updates that I

438
00:13:07,896 --> 00:13:09,706
have seen is from Blackbox,

439
00:13:10,326 --> 00:13:12,166
which is a visual puzzler that

440
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,016
now includes sonic interfaces to

441
00:13:14,016 --> 00:13:15,806
let players with low or no

442
00:13:15,806 --> 00:13:17,326
vision play through solving

443
00:13:17,326 --> 00:13:18,416
puzzles with sound.

444
00:13:19,386 --> 00:13:21,916
With 285 million blind or

445
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:23,236
low-vision people in the world,

446
00:13:23,686 --> 00:13:25,026
everybody should be able to play

447
00:13:25,026 --> 00:13:28,516
games and have fun.

448
00:13:28,736 --> 00:13:30,386
All right, with these 10 design

449
00:13:30,386 --> 00:13:31,716
tips, you'll be able to create

450
00:13:31,716 --> 00:13:33,246
great experiences from the

451
00:13:33,246 --> 00:13:35,406
moment someone taps your icon.

452
00:13:36,076 --> 00:13:38,126
But remember, of all things,

453
00:13:38,626 --> 00:13:40,606
respect your players, include

454
00:13:40,606 --> 00:13:42,156
everyone, and put their

455
00:13:42,156 --> 00:13:43,206
experience first.

456
00:13:43,696 --> 00:13:43,966
Thank you.

457
00:13:44,016 --> 00:13:46,000
