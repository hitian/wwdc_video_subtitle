00:00:28,166 --> 00:00:29,706
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

2
00:00:29,706 --> 00:00:31,386
I'm Chelsea Pugh and I'm an

3
00:00:31,386 --> 00:00:33,006
engineer on the Safari team.

4
00:00:33,646 --> 00:00:36,016
Welcome to session 225, What's

5
00:00:36,016 --> 00:00:37,666
New in Safari View Controller.

6
00:00:38,856 --> 00:00:40,166
Safari View Controller has a

7
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:42,326
bunch of improvements on iOS 11.

8
00:00:43,396 --> 00:00:45,676
It also has new APIs that were

9
00:00:45,676 --> 00:00:47,576
inspired by feedback that we got

10
00:00:47,576 --> 00:00:48,296
from developers.

11
00:00:49,476 --> 00:00:51,176
I'm really excited to share some

12
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:52,616
of Safari View Controller's new

13
00:00:52,616 --> 00:00:56,696
abilities with you today.

14
00:00:57,606 --> 00:00:59,656
One main use case of displaying

15
00:00:59,656 --> 00:01:02,066
web content on iOS is to allow

16
00:00:59,656 --> 00:01:02,066
web content on iOS is to allow

17
00:01:02,066 --> 00:01:04,436
users to browse the web in your

18
00:01:05,826 --> 00:01:05,906
app.

19
00:01:05,906 --> 00:01:07,716
You might be displaying a list

20
00:01:07,716 --> 00:01:08,976
of links that could lead the

21
00:01:08,976 --> 00:01:11,826
user to news articles or maybe

22
00:01:11,826 --> 00:01:13,906
your displaying a list of links

23
00:01:13,906 --> 00:01:15,536
that could lead to information

24
00:01:15,536 --> 00:01:17,276
of different topics on the web.

25
00:01:18,316 --> 00:01:20,546
It could, these links could your

26
00:01:20,546 --> 00:01:22,266
user anywhere on the web, and

27
00:01:22,486 --> 00:01:23,926
you don't expect to know where

28
00:01:23,926 --> 00:01:25,216
they'll end up ahead of time.

29
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:27,366
How many of you are doing

30
00:01:27,366 --> 00:01:30,366
something like this in your app?

31
00:01:30,476 --> 00:01:31,486
All right, there's a few of you

32
00:01:31,486 --> 00:01:32,026
out there.

33
00:01:32,446 --> 00:01:33,276
You're in the right place.

34
00:01:35,186 --> 00:01:37,166
Another main reason that you'd

35
00:01:37,166 --> 00:01:38,716
want to display web content on

36
00:01:38,886 --> 00:01:41,206
iOS is to allow your users to

37
00:01:41,206 --> 00:01:42,476
get authenticated with a

38
00:01:42,546 --> 00:01:44,256
third-party service so that it's

39
00:01:44,256 --> 00:01:45,866
data can be used in your app.

40
00:01:46,546 --> 00:01:47,636
How many of you do something

41
00:01:47,636 --> 00:01:48,456
like that in your app?

42
00:01:50,006 --> 00:01:51,196
You're also in the right place.

43
00:01:53,276 --> 00:01:54,916
And for those of you that are

44
00:01:54,966 --> 00:01:56,446
providing those experiences to

45
00:01:56,446 --> 00:01:57,926
your user, how many of you are

46
00:01:57,926 --> 00:01:59,436
already using Safari View

47
00:01:59,436 --> 00:02:00,026
Controller?

48
00:01:59,436 --> 00:02:00,026
Controller?

49
00:02:01,626 --> 00:02:03,366
Great. If you're already using

50
00:02:03,366 --> 00:02:05,126
Safari View Controller, we have

51
00:02:05,126 --> 00:02:06,436
some improvements to share with

52
00:02:06,436 --> 00:02:08,596
you today that will make Safari

53
00:02:08,596 --> 00:02:09,996
View Controller an even better

54
00:02:09,996 --> 00:02:11,486
experience for your users.

55
00:02:12,376 --> 00:02:13,806
If you aren't using Safari View

56
00:02:13,806 --> 00:02:15,156
Controller but you're providing

57
00:02:15,156 --> 00:02:17,106
one of those experiences, listen

58
00:02:17,836 --> 00:02:17,903
up.

59
00:02:17,903 --> 00:02:19,136
The new APIs that we're going to

60
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:21,086
talk about today were inspired

61
00:02:21,086 --> 00:02:23,016
by feedback from you, and we

62
00:02:23,016 --> 00:02:24,226
think you'll really like to hear

63
00:02:24,226 --> 00:02:24,656
about it.

64
00:02:26,946 --> 00:02:28,206
Today I'm going to cover

65
00:02:29,246 --> 00:02:31,146
displaying web content on iOS.

66
00:02:32,606 --> 00:02:33,806
Then I'll talk about how to

67
00:02:33,806 --> 00:02:35,176
really match your app's style

68
00:02:35,176 --> 00:02:36,726
using Safari View Controller.

69
00:02:37,356 --> 00:02:39,666
I'll then talk about some

70
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:40,946
improvements to Safari View

71
00:02:40,946 --> 00:02:42,526
Controller on iOS 11.

72
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:45,386
Then I'll discuss the new APIs

73
00:02:45,386 --> 00:02:47,446
that have been added to Safari

74
00:02:47,446 --> 00:02:49,376
View Controller to really tailor

75
00:02:49,376 --> 00:02:51,066
it to fit your app's use case.

76
00:02:53,486 --> 00:02:55,156
First, displaying web content.

77
00:02:55,946 --> 00:02:56,956
There are a couple of different

78
00:02:56,956 --> 00:02:58,366
ways, but today I'm going to

79
00:02:58,366 --> 00:03:00,236
talk about two of those, using

80
00:02:58,366 --> 00:03:00,236
talk about two of those, using

81
00:03:00,236 --> 00:03:02,036
SFSafariViewController and using

82
00:03:02,036 --> 00:03:02,966
WKWebView.

83
00:03:04,216 --> 00:03:05,736
To start off, let's talk about

84
00:03:05,736 --> 00:03:07,176
SFSafariViewController.

85
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:10,096
If you don't know where your

86
00:03:10,096 --> 00:03:12,446
user will be going on the web,

87
00:03:12,596 --> 00:03:14,196
Safari View Controller is really

88
00:03:14,196 --> 00:03:15,516
a good thing for you to use.

89
00:03:16,286 --> 00:03:17,706
It gives you standard browsing

90
00:03:17,706 --> 00:03:19,196
features so you don't need to

91
00:03:19,196 --> 00:03:20,586
worry about implementing an

92
00:03:20,616 --> 00:03:21,666
in-app web browser.

93
00:03:22,866 --> 00:03:24,086
With just a couple lines of

94
00:03:24,226 --> 00:03:25,876
code, you get an in-app web

95
00:03:25,876 --> 00:03:27,306
browser with all of the features

96
00:03:27,306 --> 00:03:28,646
that your users know and love

97
00:03:28,686 --> 00:03:30,636
from Safari in your app.

98
00:03:32,206 --> 00:03:33,816
Safari View Controller is also

99
00:03:33,816 --> 00:03:34,926
great for getting users

100
00:03:34,926 --> 00:03:36,516
authenticated to a third-party

101
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:36,856
service.

102
00:03:38,016 --> 00:03:39,676
It has the security that users

103
00:03:39,676 --> 00:03:41,636
need while logging in and it has

104
00:03:41,766 --> 00:03:43,126
features that can help them get

105
00:03:43,126 --> 00:03:44,046
logged in quickly.

106
00:03:44,736 --> 00:03:46,326
One main example is Password

107
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:47,016
AutoFill.

108
00:03:47,376 --> 00:03:48,496
They can quickly fill their

109
00:03:48,496 --> 00:03:50,446
saved passwords from Safari and

110
00:03:50,446 --> 00:03:51,986
log in with a tap of a button.

111
00:03:54,946 --> 00:03:57,136
Now let's talk about WKWebView.

112
00:03:57,916 --> 00:03:59,566
If you don't know the web, or if

113
00:03:59,566 --> 00:04:00,836
you know the content that you'll

114
00:03:59,566 --> 00:04:00,836
you know the content that you'll

115
00:04:00,836 --> 00:04:02,666
be displaying to users ahead of

116
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:04,296
time, or you even have control

117
00:04:04,296 --> 00:04:06,556
over the web content, WKWebView

118
00:04:06,556 --> 00:04:07,626
might be right for you.

119
00:04:08,386 --> 00:04:09,806
It allows you to manipulate the

120
00:04:09,806 --> 00:04:11,566
DOM using Javascript.

121
00:04:12,386 --> 00:04:13,676
You can also customize

122
00:04:13,676 --> 00:04:15,766
navigations by blocking or

123
00:04:15,766 --> 00:04:16,706
modifying them.

124
00:04:18,196 --> 00:04:19,846
It's a view of web content, so

125
00:04:19,846 --> 00:04:21,396
you can add your own native UI

126
00:04:21,676 --> 00:04:22,796
around the web content.

127
00:04:23,386 --> 00:04:25,126
This is great if part of your

128
00:04:25,126 --> 00:04:26,646
app's UI is implemented using

129
00:04:26,646 --> 00:04:27,676
web technologies.

130
00:04:28,816 --> 00:04:30,176
The web content can blend

131
00:04:30,296 --> 00:04:31,636
seamlessly in with your app's

132
00:04:31,636 --> 00:04:33,626
native UI, so users don't even

133
00:04:33,626 --> 00:04:35,076
need to know that they're

134
00:04:35,076 --> 00:04:36,386
interacting with web content.

135
00:04:38,466 --> 00:04:39,716
But let's get back to Safari

136
00:04:39,716 --> 00:04:40,836
View Controller since I think

137
00:04:40,836 --> 00:04:41,746
that's why you're all here.

138
00:04:44,136 --> 00:04:45,266
Safari View Controller makes

139
00:04:45,266 --> 00:04:46,616
in-app web browsing easy.

140
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:48,156
As I mentioned before, with just

141
00:04:48,156 --> 00:04:49,796
a couple lines of code, you've

142
00:04:49,796 --> 00:04:51,566
got a fully featured web browser

143
00:04:51,566 --> 00:04:54,866
within your app.

144
00:04:54,866 --> 00:04:56,496
It provides a secure and safe

145
00:04:56,566 --> 00:04:58,236
browsing experience for users.

146
00:04:59,236 --> 00:05:00,636
Let me tell you about a few of

147
00:04:59,236 --> 00:05:00,636
Let me tell you about a few of

148
00:05:00,636 --> 00:05:02,286
the security features you get

149
00:05:02,286 --> 00:05:03,516
with Safari View Controller.

150
00:05:04,936 --> 00:05:06,726
First, process separation.

151
00:05:07,426 --> 00:05:08,786
There's your app's content and

152
00:05:08,786 --> 00:05:09,776
then there's web content.

153
00:05:10,826 --> 00:05:12,296
Safari View Controller is in a

154
00:05:12,406 --> 00:05:14,376
separate process from your app.

155
00:05:14,896 --> 00:05:16,876
This means that anything that

156
00:05:16,876 --> 00:05:18,966
the user does on the web won't

157
00:05:18,966 --> 00:05:20,256
have an effect on your app's

158
00:05:20,346 --> 00:05:20,706
content.

159
00:05:21,436 --> 00:05:23,636
If they browse to malicious web

160
00:05:23,676 --> 00:05:25,566
page it won't be able to affect

161
00:05:25,626 --> 00:05:26,386
your app's data.

162
00:05:27,256 --> 00:05:28,416
You get out of the business of

163
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:30,226
taking care of user security on

164
00:05:30,226 --> 00:05:31,896
the web because Safari View

165
00:05:31,896 --> 00:05:33,296
Controller will take care of

166
00:05:33,296 --> 00:05:34,016
that for you.

167
00:05:34,886 --> 00:05:36,526
It provides critical security

168
00:05:36,556 --> 00:05:37,056
features.

169
00:05:37,266 --> 00:05:39,216
Let's talk about a couple of

170
00:05:39,296 --> 00:05:39,386
those.

171
00:05:41,576 --> 00:05:43,256
The lock icon here indicates to

172
00:05:43,256 --> 00:05:44,346
the user that they're browsing

173
00:05:44,346 --> 00:05:45,686
over a secure connection.

174
00:05:46,126 --> 00:05:47,336
This is a really important

175
00:05:47,386 --> 00:05:48,606
feature in a browser.

176
00:05:49,156 --> 00:05:50,096
And you don't need to worry

177
00:05:50,096 --> 00:05:51,446
about implementing it if you use

178
00:05:51,446 --> 00:05:52,826
Safari View Controller for your

179
00:05:52,826 --> 00:05:53,866
in-app web browser.

180
00:05:55,286 --> 00:05:57,136
Safari View Controller will also

181
00:05:57,136 --> 00:05:58,576
warn users if they might be

182
00:05:58,576 --> 00:06:00,156
trying to navigate to a page

183
00:05:58,576 --> 00:06:00,156
trying to navigate to a page

184
00:06:00,156 --> 00:06:01,376
that's going to try to steal

185
00:06:01,376 --> 00:06:02,316
their information.

186
00:06:02,986 --> 00:06:04,546
This page is trying to imitate

187
00:06:04,546 --> 00:06:06,346
example.com to get my

188
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:07,036
information.

189
00:06:07,036 --> 00:06:09,646
And you get features from

190
00:06:09,646 --> 00:06:10,236
Safari.

191
00:06:10,506 --> 00:06:11,996
Let me just highlight a few of

192
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:13,136
the features that you'll get

193
00:06:13,256 --> 00:06:14,526
with Safari View Controller.

194
00:06:15,546 --> 00:06:17,766
You get AutoFill of passwords,

195
00:06:17,766 --> 00:06:19,456
contact info, and credit cards.

196
00:06:20,096 --> 00:06:21,946
Users can quickly fill out forms

197
00:06:21,946 --> 00:06:22,536
on the web.

198
00:06:24,546 --> 00:06:26,506
Reader is an awesome feature for

199
00:06:26,506 --> 00:06:27,806
decluttering articles on the

200
00:06:27,806 --> 00:06:28,136
web.

201
00:06:28,626 --> 00:06:30,166
Our users of this feature love

202
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:31,536
it, and they'll love getting to

203
00:06:31,536 --> 00:06:32,616
use it in your app.

204
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:36,246
ApplePay on the web can help

205
00:06:36,246 --> 00:06:37,866
users quickly make payments

206
00:06:38,186 --> 00:06:39,876
while shopping on the web within

207
00:06:39,876 --> 00:06:43,156
your app.

208
00:06:43,156 --> 00:06:44,446
And users get access to the

209
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:46,106
Share Sheet that they get

210
00:06:46,106 --> 00:06:47,156
elsewhere on the system.

211
00:06:47,676 --> 00:06:49,406
They get access to some standard

212
00:06:49,466 --> 00:06:50,536
system activities that they

213
00:06:50,536 --> 00:06:52,106
might want to perform, as well

214
00:06:52,106 --> 00:06:53,836
as any third-party extensions

215
00:06:53,936 --> 00:06:55,286
that they have access to in

216
00:06:55,286 --> 00:06:55,816
Safari.

217
00:06:57,866 --> 00:06:59,196
And they get content blocker

218
00:06:59,196 --> 00:07:00,896
extensions that they'd have in

219
00:06:59,196 --> 00:07:00,896
extensions that they'd have in

220
00:07:00,946 --> 00:07:01,466
Safari.

221
00:07:01,986 --> 00:07:02,846
This means they won't be

222
00:07:02,846 --> 00:07:04,306
confused about why their

223
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:05,766
ad-blocker isn't working when

224
00:07:05,766 --> 00:07:09,326
browsing the web in your app.

225
00:07:09,326 --> 00:07:10,546
And there are so many other

226
00:07:10,546 --> 00:07:12,356
features that you get by

227
00:07:12,356 --> 00:07:13,476
implementing Safari View

228
00:07:13,476 --> 00:07:15,306
Controller as your in-app web

229
00:07:15,336 --> 00:07:15,816
browser.

230
00:07:17,946 --> 00:07:19,566
Now, I'd like to talk to you

231
00:07:19,746 --> 00:07:21,146
about how you can better match

232
00:07:21,146 --> 00:07:23,026
your app's style with Safari

233
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:24,676
View Controller on iOS 11.

234
00:07:25,156 --> 00:07:26,486
There are a couple of new ways.

235
00:07:27,846 --> 00:07:29,366
First, it has a new look.

236
00:07:30,236 --> 00:07:31,556
If you've seen Safari View

237
00:07:31,556 --> 00:07:33,786
Controller prior to iOS 11 you

238
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:34,656
might have noticed that it

239
00:07:34,656 --> 00:07:36,046
looked a lot like Safari.

240
00:07:36,776 --> 00:07:38,796
Let's take a look on iOS 11.

241
00:07:39,966 --> 00:07:41,526
It looks more like an in-app web

242
00:07:41,526 --> 00:07:43,176
browser so users don't feel like

243
00:07:43,176 --> 00:07:44,576
they've jumped out of your app.

244
00:07:45,066 --> 00:07:46,726
This is the design on iPhone.

245
00:07:47,796 --> 00:07:49,356
It looks great on iPad too.

246
00:07:51,746 --> 00:07:53,406
Now I want to talk to you about

247
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:55,246
customizing the color of Safari

248
00:07:55,246 --> 00:07:56,976
View Controller so that it fits

249
00:07:57,016 --> 00:07:58,456
with your app's color scheme.

250
00:07:59,196 --> 00:08:00,846
The ability to customize Safari

251
00:07:59,196 --> 00:08:00,846
The ability to customize Safari

252
00:08:00,846 --> 00:08:01,906
View Controller's color was

253
00:08:01,906 --> 00:08:04,356
available prior to iOS 11, but

254
00:08:04,606 --> 00:08:05,836
we've made an improvement that I

255
00:08:05,836 --> 00:08:07,086
really want you to know about.

256
00:08:08,516 --> 00:08:09,626
First, let's recap the

257
00:08:09,626 --> 00:08:10,666
customizations.

258
00:08:11,516 --> 00:08:12,916
This is a default Safari View

259
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:13,496
Controller.

260
00:08:13,536 --> 00:08:15,126
It has the same color scheme as

261
00:08:15,126 --> 00:08:16,606
Safari, blue and white.

262
00:08:17,156 --> 00:08:18,386
But let's say my app has a

263
00:08:18,386 --> 00:08:19,796
different color scheme, black

264
00:08:19,796 --> 00:08:20,286
and aqua.

265
00:08:22,046 --> 00:08:23,796
Here I started using my app's

266
00:08:23,906 --> 00:08:25,176
color scheme in Safari View

267
00:08:25,176 --> 00:08:25,756
Controller.

268
00:08:25,986 --> 00:08:27,396
So, when I present Safari View

269
00:08:27,396 --> 00:08:28,946
Controller to my users it

270
00:08:28,946 --> 00:08:30,116
doesn't feel like they've left

271
00:08:30,116 --> 00:08:31,366
my app.

272
00:08:31,366 --> 00:08:32,476
And it's a really seamless

273
00:08:32,476 --> 00:08:33,166
experience.

274
00:08:34,926 --> 00:08:36,246
You can set these colors by

275
00:08:36,246 --> 00:08:37,666
modifying properties on

276
00:08:37,706 --> 00:08:39,176
SFSafariViewController.

277
00:08:40,116 --> 00:08:41,785
To set the color of bars

278
00:08:41,836 --> 00:08:43,436
surrounding web content you can

279
00:08:43,436 --> 00:08:45,126
use preferredBarTintColor.

280
00:08:45,896 --> 00:08:47,066
And to set the color of the

281
00:08:47,066 --> 00:08:49,496
controls shown here, you can use

282
00:08:49,536 --> 00:08:51,136
preferredControlTintColor.

283
00:08:51,136 --> 00:08:54,296
Now let me tell you about an

284
00:08:54,296 --> 00:08:55,046
improvement to

285
00:08:55,046 --> 00:08:57,396
preferredBarTintColor on iOS 11.

286
00:08:58,186 --> 00:08:59,106
This is my app.

287
00:08:59,106 --> 00:09:00,406
I'm using my favorite shade of

288
00:08:59,106 --> 00:09:00,406
I'm using my favorite shade of

289
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:01,626
red for its bar color.

290
00:09:02,886 --> 00:09:04,126
Here's what it would look like

291
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:05,606
if I set that exact same shade

292
00:09:05,606 --> 00:09:06,786
of red to Safari View

293
00:09:06,786 --> 00:09:09,866
Controller's bar color on iOS

294
00:09:10,496 --> 00:09:10,606
10.

295
00:09:10,816 --> 00:09:12,206
As you can see, they don't quite

296
00:09:12,206 --> 00:09:13,406
match up.

297
00:09:13,616 --> 00:09:15,756
And it doesn't feel exactly like

298
00:09:15,756 --> 00:09:16,586
my app.

299
00:09:16,586 --> 00:09:18,466
It looks great, but it's not as

300
00:09:18,576 --> 00:09:19,496
close as it could be.

301
00:09:20,316 --> 00:09:22,156
Let's take a look on iOS 11.

302
00:09:23,356 --> 00:09:25,006
Now, the bar colors match up.

303
00:09:25,406 --> 00:09:26,676
It's just as if I was setting

304
00:09:26,676 --> 00:09:28,406
the bar color on a standard UI

305
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:30,436
navigation bar or UI toolbar.

306
00:09:31,056 --> 00:09:32,396
So, it looks really great and it

307
00:09:32,466 --> 00:09:35,826
fits well within my app.

308
00:09:36,616 --> 00:09:38,516
Now, I'm delighted to invite my

309
00:09:38,516 --> 00:09:40,156
colleague Louie Livon-Bemel to

310
00:09:40,156 --> 00:09:41,976
the stage to show you just how

311
00:09:41,976 --> 00:09:43,866
easy it is to get Safari View

312
00:09:43,866 --> 00:09:45,326
Controller matching your app's

313
00:09:45,326 --> 00:09:45,686
style.

314
00:09:46,456 --> 00:09:46,816
Thank you.

315
00:09:47,516 --> 00:09:52,836
[ Applause ]

316
00:09:53,336 --> 00:09:54,186
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Chelsea.

317
00:09:55,316 --> 00:09:57,356
Hi, I'm Louie, I'm an engineer

318
00:09:57,356 --> 00:09:58,986
on the Safari team, and I'm

319
00:09:58,986 --> 00:10:00,576
really excited to show you just

320
00:09:58,986 --> 00:10:00,576
really excited to show you just

321
00:10:00,576 --> 00:10:02,256
how easy it is to customize

322
00:10:02,256 --> 00:10:03,946
Safari View Controller to match

323
00:10:03,946 --> 00:10:07,606
your app style.

324
00:10:09,796 --> 00:10:10,756
I'm working on an all new

325
00:10:10,756 --> 00:10:12,806
version of my app, Pizza Finder.

326
00:10:13,596 --> 00:10:15,496
It's the best app for finding

327
00:10:15,496 --> 00:10:17,016
great pizza near you when you're

328
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:18,486
working on or even watching a

329
00:10:18,486 --> 00:10:18,866
demo.

330
00:10:20,526 --> 00:10:22,816
Like many of your apps, this app

331
00:10:22,816 --> 00:10:24,626
uses a standard UI Navigation

332
00:10:24,626 --> 00:10:25,196
Controller.

333
00:10:25,636 --> 00:10:27,176
I've got a list of pizza places

334
00:10:27,176 --> 00:10:29,396
here, and when I tap one, a new

335
00:10:29,396 --> 00:10:31,216
view comes in from right to left

336
00:10:31,216 --> 00:10:32,366
with more details.

337
00:10:33,446 --> 00:10:34,986
The default presentation of

338
00:10:34,986 --> 00:10:37,136
Safari View Controller is a lot

339
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:37,806
like this.

340
00:10:38,326 --> 00:10:39,476
When I tap on the website,

341
00:10:40,216 --> 00:10:41,826
Safari View Controller came in

342
00:10:41,926 --> 00:10:44,936
from right to left just like a

343
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:46,166
UI Navigation Controller.

344
00:10:46,936 --> 00:10:48,486
Users can even interactively

345
00:10:48,486 --> 00:10:49,566
edge swipe back when they're

346
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:50,206
done browsing.

347
00:10:51,866 --> 00:10:52,656
So, this is great.

348
00:10:52,746 --> 00:10:56,116
I have a very standard UI here

349
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:57,646
that my users are used to from

350
00:10:57,646 --> 00:10:59,706
Safari and any other app that's

351
00:10:59,706 --> 00:11:01,036
using Safari View Controller on

352
00:10:59,706 --> 00:11:01,036
using Safari View Controller on

353
00:11:01,036 --> 00:11:01,606
the system.

354
00:11:03,646 --> 00:11:05,326
Users even get really advanced

355
00:11:05,326 --> 00:11:07,436
features like in the Share Sheet

356
00:11:07,436 --> 00:11:08,536
all the activities they're used

357
00:11:08,536 --> 00:11:10,476
to from Safari and the powerful

358
00:11:10,476 --> 00:11:11,846
third-party extensions that

359
00:11:11,846 --> 00:11:12,696
they're used to using.

360
00:11:14,016 --> 00:11:15,276
However, this isn't perfect.

361
00:11:16,156 --> 00:11:17,246
It sort of feels like you're

362
00:11:17,246 --> 00:11:18,246
somewhere else.

363
00:11:18,566 --> 00:11:20,236
You might be in another app or

364
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:21,696
somewhere else on the system or

365
00:11:21,696 --> 00:11:23,486
somewhere else in my app, it

366
00:11:23,486 --> 00:11:25,156
doesn't, it's not clear that

367
00:11:25,156 --> 00:11:26,126
you're still within Pizza

368
00:11:26,126 --> 00:11:26,596
Finder.

369
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:28,256
So, I want to show you how to

370
00:11:28,256 --> 00:11:29,036
improve this.

371
00:11:29,536 --> 00:11:32,286
Here's where I'm presenting

372
00:11:32,286 --> 00:11:33,516
Safari View Controller in my

373
00:11:33,516 --> 00:11:33,776
app.

374
00:11:33,946 --> 00:11:34,956
It's really simple.

375
00:11:35,116 --> 00:11:36,356
All you need to do to adopt

376
00:11:36,356 --> 00:11:38,036
Safari View Controller is do two

377
00:11:38,036 --> 00:11:38,576
things.

378
00:11:39,096 --> 00:11:40,356
The first one, is create a

379
00:11:40,356 --> 00:11:42,596
Safari View Controller using the

380
00:11:42,596 --> 00:11:44,176
URL that you want to lead to.

381
00:11:46,006 --> 00:11:47,356
The second thing you need to do

382
00:11:47,466 --> 00:11:48,166
is present it.

383
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:49,616
And that's it, that's how you

384
00:11:49,616 --> 00:11:50,806
adapt Safari View Controller.

385
00:11:51,676 --> 00:11:53,356
But let's make a few changes.

386
00:11:53,986 --> 00:11:57,886
So, I've done two different

387
00:11:57,886 --> 00:11:58,316
things here.

388
00:11:58,906 --> 00:12:00,516
The first one is setting the

389
00:11:58,906 --> 00:12:00,516
The first one is setting the

390
00:12:00,516 --> 00:12:02,476
preferredBarTintColor to the

391
00:12:02,476 --> 00:12:03,606
same bar color I'm using

392
00:12:03,606 --> 00:12:04,406
elsewhere in my app.

393
00:12:04,946 --> 00:12:06,196
In this case it's that orangish

394
00:12:06,196 --> 00:12:06,766
red color.

395
00:12:08,096 --> 00:12:09,666
Second thing I'm doing is

396
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:09,986
setting the

397
00:12:09,986 --> 00:12:11,846
preferredControlTintColor to the

398
00:12:11,846 --> 00:12:13,376
same control color I'm using

399
00:12:13,376 --> 00:12:14,896
elsewhere in my app, in this

400
00:12:14,896 --> 00:12:15,676
case that's white.

401
00:12:17,026 --> 00:12:18,136
So, I'll rebuild and I'll show

402
00:12:18,136 --> 00:12:19,556
you how these changes affect

403
00:12:19,556 --> 00:12:20,216
Pizza Finder.

404
00:12:26,286 --> 00:12:27,196
Now when I look at a pizza

405
00:12:27,196 --> 00:12:29,136
place, and go to their website,

406
00:12:30,006 --> 00:12:31,446
Safari View Controller matches

407
00:12:31,446 --> 00:12:33,016
my app's branding and it's

408
00:12:33,016 --> 00:12:34,326
really obvious that I'm still

409
00:12:34,326 --> 00:12:35,456
within Pizza Finder.

410
00:12:35,576 --> 00:12:36,366
It doesn't feel like I'm

411
00:12:36,366 --> 00:12:37,166
somewhere else.

412
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:39,646
That's just how easy it is to

413
00:12:39,646 --> 00:12:41,256
customize Safari View Controller

414
00:12:41,506 --> 00:12:42,996
to match your app style and get

415
00:12:42,996 --> 00:12:44,086
your app's branding.

416
00:12:44,446 --> 00:12:45,716
Thank you so much, and I'll now

417
00:12:45,716 --> 00:12:46,746
hand it back over to Chelsea.

418
00:12:48,516 --> 00:12:53,056
[ Applause ]

419
00:12:53,556 --> 00:12:54,276
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Louie.

420
00:12:55,396 --> 00:12:57,186
Louie just showed you how easy

421
00:12:57,186 --> 00:12:59,346
it is to get his app's branding

422
00:12:59,346 --> 00:13:00,666
in Safari View Controller.

423
00:12:59,346 --> 00:13:00,666
in Safari View Controller.

424
00:13:01,236 --> 00:13:02,406
With just a couple lines of

425
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:03,716
code, he had Safari View

426
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:05,096
Controller up and running with

427
00:13:05,096 --> 00:13:06,446
his app's color scheme.

428
00:13:08,246 --> 00:13:09,896
We can't wait to see how good

429
00:13:09,976 --> 00:13:11,436
Safari View Controller's color

430
00:13:11,436 --> 00:13:14,866
schemes look on your app.

431
00:13:15,136 --> 00:13:17,126
Now, I'd like to talk to you

432
00:13:17,476 --> 00:13:18,646
about some improvements that

433
00:13:18,646 --> 00:13:19,746
we've made to Safari View

434
00:13:19,746 --> 00:13:21,476
Controller on iOS 11.

435
00:13:22,376 --> 00:13:24,166
There are five key improvements

436
00:13:24,216 --> 00:13:25,446
that I'm going to talk about.

437
00:13:27,566 --> 00:13:29,326
You may have heard about the new

438
00:13:29,396 --> 00:13:31,216
feature on iOS 11, Drag and

439
00:13:31,216 --> 00:13:31,486
Drop.

440
00:13:32,316 --> 00:13:34,006
I'm excited to let you know that

441
00:13:34,006 --> 00:13:36,096
on iOS 11, Safari View

442
00:13:36,096 --> 00:13:37,856
Controller has Drag and Drop out

443
00:13:37,856 --> 00:13:38,446
of the box.

444
00:13:38,856 --> 00:13:40,926
Users can easily drag URLs out

445
00:13:40,926 --> 00:13:42,606
of Safari View Controller into

446
00:13:43,646 --> 00:13:45,276
other apps.

447
00:13:45,516 --> 00:13:46,686
Now I'd like to talk to you

448
00:13:46,686 --> 00:13:48,586
about some improvements to how

449
00:13:48,586 --> 00:13:50,316
Status Bar styling works in

450
00:13:50,316 --> 00:13:51,486
Safari View Controller.

451
00:13:54,036 --> 00:13:55,346
When presenting Safari View

452
00:13:55,346 --> 00:13:56,796
Controller in some apps, the

453
00:13:56,796 --> 00:13:58,486
Status Bar can become difficult

454
00:13:58,486 --> 00:13:58,876
to read.

455
00:14:00,436 --> 00:14:01,976
It's hard to even notice here,

456
00:14:02,026 --> 00:14:03,966
but I have a dark purple bar,

457
00:14:03,966 --> 00:14:05,846
with a black Status Bar text on

458
00:14:05,846 --> 00:14:07,516
top, and it's illegible.

459
00:14:09,396 --> 00:14:11,296
Ideally, you'd want white Status

460
00:14:11,296 --> 00:14:13,386
Bar text so that the user can

461
00:14:13,386 --> 00:14:15,956
easily read the Status Bar, but

462
00:14:16,256 --> 00:14:17,946
if you just hard code a specific

463
00:14:18,006 --> 00:14:19,746
Status Bar style, you're not

464
00:14:19,996 --> 00:14:21,446
fully fixing the problem.

465
00:14:21,506 --> 00:14:25,176
Other views can be presented in

466
00:14:25,176 --> 00:14:27,156
Safari View Controller such as

467
00:14:27,156 --> 00:14:29,256
the Messages extension, or a

468
00:14:29,316 --> 00:14:30,276
full-screen video.

469
00:14:31,286 --> 00:14:32,806
Here the user is sharing to

470
00:14:32,806 --> 00:14:35,466
Messages so the white Status Bar

471
00:14:35,466 --> 00:14:37,546
style that's been hard coded is

472
00:14:37,546 --> 00:14:39,156
illegible over the white bar of

473
00:14:39,156 --> 00:14:40,196
the Messages view.

474
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:44,716
The bottom line is that other

475
00:14:44,716 --> 00:14:46,676
views can be presented in Safari

476
00:14:46,676 --> 00:14:47,396
View Controller.

477
00:14:48,946 --> 00:14:50,106
Safari View Controller has

478
00:14:50,106 --> 00:14:52,006
improvements to better adapt the

479
00:14:52,086 --> 00:14:53,866
Status Bar style when other

480
00:14:53,866 --> 00:14:56,036
views are presented on iOS 11.

481
00:14:57,066 --> 00:14:58,806
In order to allow this to work,

482
00:14:59,056 --> 00:14:59,846
you'll want to use

483
00:14:59,846 --> 00:15:01,436
UIViewController-based Status

484
00:14:59,846 --> 00:15:01,436
UIViewController-based Status

485
00:15:01,506 --> 00:15:02,156
Bar appearance.

486
00:15:02,996 --> 00:15:04,306
This has been the recommendation

487
00:15:04,306 --> 00:15:06,576
for all apps since iOS 7.

488
00:15:07,536 --> 00:15:08,796
To do this, you can set

489
00:15:08,796 --> 00:15:10,256
UIViewControllerBased

490
00:15:10,256 --> 00:15:12,106
StatusBarAppearance to yes in

491
00:15:12,106 --> 00:15:13,356
your app's Info.plist.

492
00:15:14,636 --> 00:15:16,086
This will ensure that the Status

493
00:15:16,116 --> 00:15:17,766
Bar remains legible even when

494
00:15:17,766 --> 00:15:19,286
other views are presented in

495
00:15:19,286 --> 00:15:20,326
Safari View Controller.

496
00:15:20,326 --> 00:15:24,156
Now I'd like to tell you about

497
00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:26,106
another improvement, but it

498
00:15:26,106 --> 00:15:27,616
requires a bit of background.

499
00:15:28,106 --> 00:15:30,046
So, I'd like to explain a

500
00:15:30,106 --> 00:15:31,736
scenario in Safari to start.

501
00:15:32,966 --> 00:15:34,626
A common experience on the web

502
00:15:34,876 --> 00:15:36,276
is checkout with a third-party

503
00:15:36,276 --> 00:15:36,726
service.

504
00:15:37,526 --> 00:15:39,186
Here I have a page that's asking

505
00:15:39,186 --> 00:15:40,836
me to checkout using Example

506
00:15:40,836 --> 00:15:41,336
Checkout.

507
00:15:41,846 --> 00:15:45,986
When I tap buy now in Safari, a

508
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:48,256
new tab is opened and I'm able

509
00:15:48,326 --> 00:15:49,516
to complete my payment.

510
00:15:51,246 --> 00:15:53,626
When I tap Buy Now on Example

511
00:15:53,626 --> 00:15:56,316
Checkout, I -- and complete my

512
00:15:56,396 --> 00:15:59,526
payment, the tab that was opened

513
00:15:59,526 --> 00:16:01,006
is closed and I'm back on the

514
00:15:59,526 --> 00:16:01,006
is closed and I'm back on the

515
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:02,466
store site that I was on.

516
00:16:02,976 --> 00:16:04,066
And the store knows that I've

517
00:16:04,066 --> 00:16:05,556
completed my payment.

518
00:16:06,536 --> 00:16:07,646
This is an example of what

519
00:16:07,646 --> 00:16:09,326
happens when a webpage calls

520
00:16:09,326 --> 00:16:11,466
window.open and subsequently

521
00:16:11,466 --> 00:16:12,736
calls window.close.

522
00:16:13,716 --> 00:16:15,246
It previously wasn't supported

523
00:16:15,246 --> 00:16:16,446
in Safari View Controller

524
00:16:16,446 --> 00:16:17,666
because Safari View Controller

525
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:18,656
doesn't have tabs.

526
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:21,476
But on iOS 11 Safari View

527
00:16:21,476 --> 00:16:23,346
Controller supports window.open.

528
00:16:23,776 --> 00:16:27,056
[applause] It's pretty great,

529
00:16:28,846 --> 00:16:29,266
yeah.

530
00:16:29,516 --> 00:16:31,706
The way that this now works is

531
00:16:32,156 --> 00:16:34,406
in Safari View Controller when I

532
00:16:34,476 --> 00:16:37,306
tap Buy Now a new, I've

533
00:16:37,306 --> 00:16:39,076
navigated forward instead of

534
00:16:39,076 --> 00:16:39,856
opening a new tab.

535
00:16:41,186 --> 00:16:42,966
Once I've completed my payment

536
00:16:43,096 --> 00:16:45,216
after tapping Buy Now, I'm

537
00:16:45,376 --> 00:16:47,666
navigated back to the page, the

538
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:50,236
domain I was on and the page

539
00:16:50,236 --> 00:16:51,626
knows that I've completed my

540
00:16:51,626 --> 00:16:52,166
payment.

541
00:16:53,046 --> 00:16:54,326
So, I get a confirmation in

542
00:16:54,326 --> 00:16:55,486
Safari View Controller.

543
00:16:56,586 --> 00:16:58,346
This is new to iOS 11.

544
00:17:00,576 --> 00:17:02,126
Now I'd like to talk about some

545
00:17:02,126 --> 00:17:05,026
privacy improvements on iOS 11

546
00:17:05,445 --> 00:17:06,606
in Safari View Controller.

547
00:17:09,386 --> 00:17:11,126
Browsing the web in your app is

548
00:17:11,126 --> 00:17:12,276
different than browsing the web

549
00:17:12,276 --> 00:17:13,066
in other apps.

550
00:17:13,935 --> 00:17:15,116
It's different than browsing the

551
00:17:15,116 --> 00:17:16,246
web in Safari.

552
00:17:17,026 --> 00:17:19,576
I sometimes want to use

553
00:17:19,646 --> 00:17:20,996
different accounts when browsing

554
00:17:20,996 --> 00:17:21,935
the web in different apps.

555
00:17:22,896 --> 00:17:24,465
For some apps, I'll use my work

556
00:17:24,465 --> 00:17:25,786
account and for other apps I'll

557
00:17:25,786 --> 00:17:27,026
use my personal account.

558
00:17:28,205 --> 00:17:30,456
On iOS 11, Safari View

559
00:17:30,456 --> 00:17:31,786
Controller will have a separate

560
00:17:31,786 --> 00:17:34,156
persistent data store in each

561
00:17:34,476 --> 00:17:35,596
app that it's used in.

562
00:17:36,326 --> 00:17:38,176
This means that cookies, local

563
00:17:38,246 --> 00:17:39,816
storage, and other browsing data

564
00:17:40,346 --> 00:17:41,726
will be contained within your

565
00:17:42,046 --> 00:17:43,486
app and scoped to your app.

566
00:17:44,816 --> 00:17:46,966
And this means that the user

567
00:17:46,966 --> 00:17:48,526
won't automatically be logged in

568
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:49,856
to whatever accounts they were

569
00:17:49,856 --> 00:17:51,326
logged into in Safari.

570
00:17:52,006 --> 00:17:54,476
What this does is it will

571
00:17:54,476 --> 00:17:56,456
prevent cross-app tracking of

572
00:17:56,456 --> 00:17:58,496
user's browsing activity that

573
00:17:58,496 --> 00:18:00,216
you and your users may not have

574
00:17:58,496 --> 00:18:00,216
you and your users may not have

575
00:18:00,216 --> 00:18:01,326
even been aware about.

576
00:18:02,006 --> 00:18:04,006
And ultimately, it helps keep

577
00:18:04,006 --> 00:18:06,036
users' browsing activity private

578
00:18:06,306 --> 00:18:08,626
and scoped within your app.

579
00:18:09,846 --> 00:18:11,456
Now I'd like to talk about a

580
00:18:11,456 --> 00:18:13,086
change to Private Browsing in

581
00:18:13,086 --> 00:18:14,266
Safari View Controller.

582
00:18:15,456 --> 00:18:16,826
Now that Safari View Controller

583
00:18:16,826 --> 00:18:19,126
has its own separate persistent

584
00:18:19,126 --> 00:18:21,426
data store for each app, it's

585
00:18:21,426 --> 00:18:23,026
browsing mode is no longer tied

586
00:18:23,026 --> 00:18:25,496
to Safari's this means that I

587
00:18:25,496 --> 00:18:27,206
now longer get the following

588
00:18:27,346 --> 00:18:28,606
frustrating experience.

589
00:18:29,816 --> 00:18:31,576
I'm browsing the web in Safari

590
00:18:31,656 --> 00:18:33,946
in Private Mode.

591
00:18:34,156 --> 00:18:37,236
Time passes and later that day

592
00:18:37,576 --> 00:18:38,866
after I've forgotten that I was

593
00:18:38,866 --> 00:18:41,116
even in Private Mode, I go to my

594
00:18:41,116 --> 00:18:42,886
favorite app that opens links

595
00:18:42,886 --> 00:18:44,296
using Safari View Controller.

596
00:18:45,686 --> 00:18:46,846
Safari View Controller is

597
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:49,176
presented in Private Mode once I

598
00:18:49,176 --> 00:18:51,306
open a link and that's confusing

599
00:18:51,306 --> 00:18:52,306
to me because I didn't

600
00:18:52,306 --> 00:18:54,116
intentionally tell it to open in

601
00:18:54,116 --> 00:18:55,116
Private Browsing Mode.

602
00:18:56,286 --> 00:18:58,136
So, on iOS 11 now that Safari

603
00:18:58,136 --> 00:18:59,796
View Controller has its own

604
00:19:00,546 --> 00:19:02,496
browsing mode, it's no longer

605
00:19:02,636 --> 00:19:03,726
tied to Safari's.

606
00:19:04,856 --> 00:19:06,556
That means that your apps' color

607
00:19:06,556 --> 00:19:08,446
scheme will be used more often.

608
00:19:08,446 --> 00:19:14,016
Now I'd like to tell you about

609
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:15,786
three new APIs that we've added

610
00:19:16,236 --> 00:19:17,916
so you can really tailor Safari

611
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:19,726
View Controller to fit your

612
00:19:20,036 --> 00:19:20,916
app's experience.

613
00:19:22,956 --> 00:19:24,556
First I'd like to talk to about

614
00:19:24,556 --> 00:19:25,926
how you can now customize the

615
00:19:25,926 --> 00:19:27,556
Dismiss button of Safari View

616
00:19:27,556 --> 00:19:28,146
Controller.

617
00:19:28,636 --> 00:19:31,826
Language is very important when

618
00:19:31,826 --> 00:19:33,436
conveying intent to the user.

619
00:19:34,806 --> 00:19:36,176
The standard Dismiss button

620
00:19:36,176 --> 00:19:38,176
style for Safari View Controller

621
00:19:38,246 --> 00:19:38,786
is Done.

622
00:19:39,656 --> 00:19:40,906
This works really well for a

623
00:19:41,006 --> 00:19:42,406
standard browsing case, because

624
00:19:42,406 --> 00:19:43,536
the user can browse through a

625
00:19:43,536 --> 00:19:45,006
bunch of different web pages and

626
00:19:45,236 --> 00:19:46,216
then when they're finished

627
00:19:46,216 --> 00:19:48,166
browsing tap Done to indicate

628
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:48,876
that they've ended their

629
00:19:48,876 --> 00:19:49,796
browsing session.

630
00:19:51,866 --> 00:19:53,896
On iOS 11 we've added two new

631
00:19:53,896 --> 00:19:55,606
options that this Dismiss button

632
00:19:55,606 --> 00:19:56,386
can take on.

633
00:19:57,286 --> 00:19:58,856
The first of those options is

634
00:19:58,856 --> 00:19:59,416
Cancel.

635
00:20:00,426 --> 00:20:01,926
I think Cancel makes a lot of

636
00:20:01,986 --> 00:20:03,316
sense when I'm getting my user's

637
00:20:03,316 --> 00:20:04,946
authenticated to a third-party

638
00:20:04,946 --> 00:20:05,396
service.

639
00:20:06,386 --> 00:20:07,866
The user will know that if they

640
00:20:07,866 --> 00:20:09,516
tap that button, they're not

641
00:20:09,516 --> 00:20:10,726
really authenticating with my

642
00:20:10,806 --> 00:20:12,336
service, they're cancelling the

643
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:13,126
transaction.

644
00:20:14,306 --> 00:20:16,336
The other new style is Close.

645
00:20:17,286 --> 00:20:18,356
This makes sense if I'm

646
00:20:18,356 --> 00:20:19,776
presenting some transient web

647
00:20:19,776 --> 00:20:21,646
content to the user, perhaps a

648
00:20:21,646 --> 00:20:23,096
Terms of Service page.

649
00:20:24,336 --> 00:20:25,436
I'm giving them a page where

650
00:20:25,436 --> 00:20:26,486
they're probably not likely to

651
00:20:26,486 --> 00:20:28,316
follow other links, so they'll

652
00:20:28,316 --> 00:20:30,326
just Close once they've finished

653
00:20:30,326 --> 00:20:34,936
reading what I've presented to

654
00:20:35,146 --> 00:20:35,386
them.

655
00:20:35,426 --> 00:20:36,306
Now I'd like, or the Dismiss

656
00:20:36,306 --> 00:20:39,026
button style is a property on

657
00:20:39,226 --> 00:20:40,466
SFSafariViewController.

658
00:20:40,466 --> 00:20:42,966
As I mentioned it has these two

659
00:20:42,966 --> 00:20:43,696
new options.

660
00:20:44,106 --> 00:20:45,586
The default style will be Done

661
00:20:45,896 --> 00:20:46,946
but you can choose which ever

662
00:20:46,946 --> 00:20:48,886
style best fits your use case of

663
00:20:48,886 --> 00:20:50,006
Safari View Controller.

664
00:20:51,546 --> 00:20:52,936
The value can even be changed

665
00:20:52,936 --> 00:20:54,266
while Safari View Controller is

666
00:20:54,266 --> 00:20:55,726
presented, which Louie will

667
00:20:55,726 --> 00:20:56,666
demonstrate later.

668
00:20:56,666 --> 00:21:00,666
Now I'd like to talk to you

669
00:20:56,666 --> 00:21:00,666
Now I'd like to talk to you

670
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:02,136
about a customization you can

671
00:21:02,136 --> 00:21:03,866
make to the Share Sheet in

672
00:21:03,866 --> 00:21:04,976
Safari View Controller.

673
00:21:07,596 --> 00:21:09,536
Let's say I'm presenting a login

674
00:21:09,566 --> 00:21:10,426
flow to the user.

675
00:21:11,566 --> 00:21:12,946
When the tap the share button

676
00:21:12,946 --> 00:21:13,886
they have all these different

677
00:21:14,006 --> 00:21:15,816
actions that they can take, but

678
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:16,836
some of them don't really make

679
00:21:16,836 --> 00:21:17,806
sense in this case.

680
00:21:18,646 --> 00:21:19,736
They're probably not going to

681
00:21:19,836 --> 00:21:21,196
send the page somewhere else

682
00:21:21,516 --> 00:21:22,626
because it might disrupt the

683
00:21:22,626 --> 00:21:24,646
login flow and the login might

684
00:21:24,646 --> 00:21:25,726
now even work outside of the

685
00:21:25,726 --> 00:21:26,566
context of my app.

686
00:21:29,006 --> 00:21:31,676
Here, I've filtered out, so this

687
00:21:31,676 --> 00:21:33,786
is what the actions that I don't

688
00:21:33,786 --> 00:21:34,276
want to show.

689
00:21:35,056 --> 00:21:36,796
On iOS 11 we're giving the

690
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:38,566
ability to filter out some of

691
00:21:38,566 --> 00:21:40,106
these UIActivityTypes.

692
00:21:41,266 --> 00:21:43,896
Here, I've filtered out AirDrop,

693
00:21:44,066 --> 00:21:46,456
Mail, and Messages because my

694
00:21:46,456 --> 00:21:47,926
users don't need them in this

695
00:21:47,926 --> 00:21:48,256
case.

696
00:21:50,346 --> 00:21:52,346
You make recognize this API on

697
00:21:52,346 --> 00:21:53,916
UIActivityViewController.

698
00:21:54,496 --> 00:21:56,816
It allows you to set an array of

699
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:58,636
UIActivityTypes that the user

700
00:21:58,636 --> 00:22:00,446
doesn't need on your

701
00:21:58,636 --> 00:22:00,446
doesn't need on your

702
00:22:00,446 --> 00:22:01,956
UIActivityViewController.

703
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:03,626
We realize that if you're

704
00:22:03,626 --> 00:22:05,026
implementing your own in-app web

705
00:22:05,026 --> 00:22:06,636
browsing experience, you'd have

706
00:22:06,636 --> 00:22:08,056
the ability to customize the

707
00:22:08,056 --> 00:22:09,266
Share Sheet in this way.

708
00:22:10,316 --> 00:22:12,076
So, in iOS 11 we're exposing

709
00:22:12,076 --> 00:22:13,546
this same ability on

710
00:22:13,726 --> 00:22:16,576
SFSafariViewControllerDelegate

711
00:22:17,046 --> 00:22:18,846
as a method where you can return

712
00:22:18,846 --> 00:22:21,426
an array of UIActivityTypes that

713
00:22:21,426 --> 00:22:22,846
you don't want to be presented

714
00:22:22,846 --> 00:22:24,806
to the user in the context of

715
00:22:24,806 --> 00:22:26,146
your Safari View Controller.

716
00:22:28,376 --> 00:22:29,806
Now, I'd like to talk about Bar

717
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:31,366
Collapsing in Safari View

718
00:22:31,366 --> 00:22:31,916
Controller.

719
00:22:33,496 --> 00:22:36,756
Safari View Controller's bars

720
00:22:36,816 --> 00:22:38,426
collapse away while in browsing,

721
00:22:38,886 --> 00:22:39,906
which lets me really get

722
00:22:39,906 --> 00:22:41,356
immersed in my browsing

723
00:22:41,356 --> 00:22:42,086
experience.

724
00:22:43,546 --> 00:22:45,686
However, in some cases this bar

725
00:22:45,686 --> 00:22:46,906
collapsing behavior can be

726
00:22:46,906 --> 00:22:47,586
frustrating.

727
00:22:48,276 --> 00:22:49,836
Let's say I have a login flow.

728
00:22:50,486 --> 00:22:52,316
If bars are collapsed, the

729
00:22:52,316 --> 00:22:54,066
Dismiss button gets hidden.

730
00:22:54,306 --> 00:22:55,676
So, it's a bit more difficult to

731
00:22:55,676 --> 00:22:57,276
Dismiss Safari View Controller.

732
00:22:58,656 --> 00:22:59,766
So, in something quick like a

733
00:22:59,766 --> 00:23:02,806
login flow, this standard bar

734
00:22:59,766 --> 00:23:02,806
login flow, this standard bar

735
00:23:02,806 --> 00:23:04,656
collapsing behavior might not

736
00:23:04,656 --> 00:23:06,636
necessarily make sense.

737
00:23:07,046 --> 00:23:10,276
On iOS 11, we're allowing you to

738
00:23:10,276 --> 00:23:11,476
disable this standard bar

739
00:23:11,476 --> 00:23:12,976
collapsing behavior if it best

740
00:23:13,066 --> 00:23:13,976
fits your use case.

741
00:23:15,436 --> 00:23:17,366
This will be a new property on

742
00:23:17,366 --> 00:23:18,746
SFSafariViewController

743
00:23:18,746 --> 00:23:20,666
.Configuration which will be

744
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:22,196
passed into Safari View

745
00:23:22,196 --> 00:23:23,656
Controller's initializer.

746
00:23:24,256 --> 00:23:27,246
It's best to leave this enabled

747
00:23:27,596 --> 00:23:29,466
if your use case is show user's

748
00:23:29,506 --> 00:23:31,986
browsing, or user's content that

749
00:23:31,986 --> 00:23:33,206
they should really get immersed

750
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:33,456
in.

751
00:23:34,236 --> 00:23:35,686
But, if it's important to always

752
00:23:35,686 --> 00:23:37,246
have the Dismiss button shown,

753
00:23:38,076 --> 00:23:39,486
you can disable this property.

754
00:23:39,486 --> 00:23:44,036
Now, I'd like to welcome Louie

755
00:23:44,036 --> 00:23:45,476
back to the stage to show you

756
00:23:45,476 --> 00:23:47,266
how easy it is to use these new

757
00:23:47,266 --> 00:23:49,456
APIs to tailor for his app's

758
00:23:49,456 --> 00:23:50,096
experience.

759
00:23:51,516 --> 00:23:56,546
[ Applause ]

760
00:23:57,046 --> 00:23:57,696
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Chelsea.

761
00:23:58,686 --> 00:24:00,286
I'm thrilled to show you how

762
00:23:58,686 --> 00:24:00,286
I'm thrilled to show you how

763
00:24:00,286 --> 00:24:01,746
easy it is to customize Safari

764
00:24:01,746 --> 00:24:03,286
View Controller using these new

765
00:24:03,286 --> 00:24:05,216
APIs and I'm going to give you a

766
00:24:05,216 --> 00:24:06,806
sneak peak at the next app I'm

767
00:24:06,806 --> 00:24:07,416
working on.

768
00:24:09,056 --> 00:24:11,076
It's another pizza related app,

769
00:24:11,266 --> 00:24:12,936
so I hope that's not too cheesy.

770
00:24:13,456 --> 00:24:16,826
[laughter] This is a social app

771
00:24:16,966 --> 00:24:18,226
called Pizza Stories.

772
00:24:18,846 --> 00:24:20,086
It allows you to share all the

773
00:24:20,086 --> 00:24:21,596
pizza related news in your life

774
00:24:21,596 --> 00:24:23,106
in a visual format with your

775
00:24:23,106 --> 00:24:24,246
friends and family.

776
00:24:26,396 --> 00:24:28,656
By default, it when you're not

777
00:24:28,656 --> 00:24:30,276
logged in, you get a list of

778
00:24:30,276 --> 00:24:31,626
pizza brands that are sharing

779
00:24:31,626 --> 00:24:32,486
some stories.

780
00:24:33,636 --> 00:24:34,956
However, to get the best

781
00:24:34,956 --> 00:24:36,016
experience out of this app,

782
00:24:36,336 --> 00:24:37,256
you'll want to log-in.

783
00:24:38,066 --> 00:24:40,756
I don't want users to have to

784
00:24:40,756 --> 00:24:42,876
create and maintain a list of

785
00:24:42,876 --> 00:24:44,766
their friends in my app, and I

786
00:24:44,766 --> 00:24:46,016
don't own a social network that

787
00:24:46,016 --> 00:24:48,336
already has this, so I want them

788
00:24:48,336 --> 00:24:49,736
to be able to use an existing

789
00:24:49,736 --> 00:24:51,146
list that they've already used

790
00:24:51,426 --> 00:24:53,366
and created all of their friends

791
00:24:54,046 --> 00:24:55,766
on an existing social network.

792
00:24:56,626 --> 00:24:58,196
I'm using Safari View Controller

793
00:24:58,336 --> 00:24:59,436
to let them log-in and

794
00:24:59,436 --> 00:25:00,786
authenticate against this social

795
00:24:59,436 --> 00:25:00,786
authenticate against this social

796
00:25:00,786 --> 00:25:01,176
network.

797
00:25:01,626 --> 00:25:04,646
I tap Log In, Safari View

798
00:25:04,646 --> 00:25:06,206
Controller is shown and let's my

799
00:25:06,206 --> 00:25:08,286
users log in with SampleChat a

800
00:25:08,286 --> 00:25:09,836
really popular demo social

801
00:25:09,836 --> 00:25:10,266
network.

802
00:25:12,176 --> 00:25:13,336
You may have noticed that Safari

803
00:25:13,336 --> 00:25:15,116
View Controller came in from

804
00:25:15,116 --> 00:25:16,226
right to left like a

805
00:25:16,226 --> 00:25:18,066
UINavigationController.

806
00:25:18,696 --> 00:25:19,896
My app doesn't use this

807
00:25:19,896 --> 00:25:21,736
paradigm, so that feels a little

808
00:25:21,736 --> 00:25:22,156
weird.

809
00:25:23,006 --> 00:25:25,706
I have already made it so that

810
00:25:25,706 --> 00:25:27,076
Safari View Controller takes on

811
00:25:27,076 --> 00:25:30,596
the colors of my app, but the

812
00:25:30,596 --> 00:25:32,156
transition didn't feel right for

813
00:25:32,156 --> 00:25:33,106
my app.

814
00:25:33,246 --> 00:25:35,946
Similarly, saying Done doesn't

815
00:25:35,946 --> 00:25:36,896
really make sense here.

816
00:25:37,316 --> 00:25:38,446
I want to communicate to my

817
00:25:38,446 --> 00:25:40,506
users that tapping this button

818
00:25:40,506 --> 00:25:42,246
will cancel this login session.

819
00:25:42,756 --> 00:25:44,596
So, it's clear what's going to

820
00:25:44,686 --> 00:25:45,616
happen when they tap it.

821
00:25:46,266 --> 00:25:48,056
And if my users are reading the

822
00:25:48,056 --> 00:25:49,486
Terms of Service and they scroll

823
00:25:49,486 --> 00:25:51,246
down a little bit, the bars

824
00:25:51,246 --> 00:25:51,856
collapse.

825
00:25:52,186 --> 00:25:53,856
This might nice in some other

826
00:25:53,856 --> 00:25:55,546
web pages, but here it could

827
00:25:55,546 --> 00:25:56,366
just get annoying.

828
00:25:56,786 --> 00:25:58,696
If they want to cancel, it's two

829
00:25:58,696 --> 00:25:59,996
taps away instead of one.

830
00:26:01,276 --> 00:26:02,626
So, I'll show you how to improve

831
00:26:02,626 --> 00:26:04,176
Safari View Controller to fit

832
00:26:04,176 --> 00:26:08,366
this log in a little bit better.

833
00:26:08,566 --> 00:26:09,376
Here's where I'm presenting

834
00:26:09,376 --> 00:26:10,466
Safari View Controller.

835
00:26:11,016 --> 00:26:12,336
Like before, it's pretty simple.

836
00:26:12,856 --> 00:26:15,126
I'm creating a URL and then

837
00:26:15,416 --> 00:26:16,546
passing that to Safari View

838
00:26:16,546 --> 00:26:17,636
Controller's initializer.

839
00:26:18,946 --> 00:26:20,326
Customizing the colors as I

840
00:26:20,326 --> 00:26:21,126
showed you before.

841
00:26:21,706 --> 00:26:23,916
And then presenting Safari View

842
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:24,366
Controller.

843
00:26:25,196 --> 00:26:27,146
But let's make some changes.

844
00:26:27,306 --> 00:26:28,526
First, let's make sure that the

845
00:26:28,526 --> 00:26:29,726
bars don't collapse when they

846
00:26:29,726 --> 00:26:30,306
scroll down.

847
00:26:34,956 --> 00:26:36,206
So, what I've done here is

848
00:26:36,206 --> 00:26:37,666
created a Safari View Controller

849
00:26:37,666 --> 00:26:39,826
configuration object and then

850
00:26:39,826 --> 00:26:41,416
set its barCollapsingEnabled

851
00:26:41,416 --> 00:26:42,536
property to false.

852
00:26:42,866 --> 00:26:44,136
This way when they scroll down

853
00:26:44,136 --> 00:26:45,266
the bars won't collapse, they'll

854
00:26:45,266 --> 00:26:46,556
still stay full height.

855
00:26:47,566 --> 00:26:49,116
I then pass this in to Safari

856
00:26:49,116 --> 00:26:50,306
View Controller's initializer.

857
00:26:51,796 --> 00:26:52,586
Let's make a couple other

858
00:26:52,586 --> 00:26:53,296
changes.

859
00:26:55,016 --> 00:26:57,056
I've done two different things

860
00:26:57,056 --> 00:26:57,306
here.

861
00:26:57,566 --> 00:26:58,786
The first, is setting

862
00:26:58,786 --> 00:27:01,206
dismissButtonStyle to Cancel so

863
00:26:58,786 --> 00:27:01,206
dismissButtonStyle to Cancel so

864
00:27:01,206 --> 00:27:02,626
that the button will say Cancel

865
00:27:02,626 --> 00:27:03,726
instead of Done, which is the

866
00:27:03,726 --> 00:27:04,216
default.

867
00:27:05,536 --> 00:27:06,646
Second change I've made is

868
00:27:06,646 --> 00:27:07,896
slightly more complicated.

869
00:27:08,346 --> 00:27:09,266
I'm overriding the

870
00:27:09,266 --> 00:27:10,666
transitioningDelegate of Safari

871
00:27:10,666 --> 00:27:12,196
View Controller to myself.

872
00:27:13,146 --> 00:27:14,486
Since I haven't implemented any

873
00:27:14,486 --> 00:27:15,266
of the methods of

874
00:27:15,266 --> 00:27:16,576
UITransitioningDelegate, I'm

875
00:27:16,576 --> 00:27:18,196
just going to get the standard

876
00:27:18,196 --> 00:27:20,346
system default behavior where a

877
00:27:20,346 --> 00:27:21,606
view comes in from bottom to

878
00:27:21,606 --> 00:27:22,036
top.

879
00:27:23,476 --> 00:27:24,456
I'll rebuild and show you how

880
00:27:24,456 --> 00:27:25,816
this works in Pizza Stories.

881
00:27:29,496 --> 00:27:32,286
Now when I tap Log In, Safari

882
00:27:32,286 --> 00:27:33,436
View Controller came in from

883
00:27:33,436 --> 00:27:34,256
bottom to top.

884
00:27:35,136 --> 00:27:36,426
Now you may notice here, the

885
00:27:36,426 --> 00:27:37,216
view is blank.

886
00:27:37,396 --> 00:27:38,726
This is a bug on Seed 1.

887
00:27:38,786 --> 00:27:40,136
If you do run into this, I'll

888
00:27:40,136 --> 00:27:41,026
show you how to fix it.

889
00:27:41,506 --> 00:27:42,296
You can either pull down

890
00:27:42,296 --> 00:27:44,206
Notification Center or press the

891
00:27:44,206 --> 00:27:46,506
Home button and then go back in

892
00:27:46,586 --> 00:27:49,636
and the page loads.

893
00:27:49,636 --> 00:27:51,746
So, in addition to the new

894
00:27:51,746 --> 00:27:54,116
presentation, the Dismiss button

895
00:27:54,116 --> 00:27:55,626
says Cancel to better indicate

896
00:27:55,626 --> 00:27:56,946
to my users what tapping this

897
00:27:56,946 --> 00:27:57,326
will do.

898
00:27:57,886 --> 00:28:00,506
And when I scroll down, the bars

899
00:27:57,886 --> 00:28:00,506
And when I scroll down, the bars

900
00:28:00,506 --> 00:28:01,186
don't squish.

901
00:28:02,366 --> 00:28:03,376
So, we're almost there.

902
00:28:03,856 --> 00:28:04,946
However, there's one more change

903
00:28:04,946 --> 00:28:05,416
I want to make.

904
00:28:07,116 --> 00:28:08,306
Right now, it makes sense for

905
00:28:08,306 --> 00:28:09,466
the button to say Cancel.

906
00:28:10,476 --> 00:28:11,816
But, when my users successfully

907
00:28:11,816 --> 00:28:13,386
logged in, it shouldn't say

908
00:28:13,386 --> 00:28:13,916
Cancel.

909
00:28:13,916 --> 00:28:15,106
I want to indicate to them that

910
00:28:15,106 --> 00:28:16,586
it's okay to dismiss after that.

911
00:28:18,296 --> 00:28:19,616
So, as Chelsea mentioned before,

912
00:28:19,616 --> 00:28:20,556
what's really cool about this

913
00:28:20,556 --> 00:28:21,976
property is it can be changed

914
00:28:21,976 --> 00:28:23,256
even after I've already

915
00:28:23,366 --> 00:28:24,296
presented Safari View

916
00:28:24,296 --> 00:28:24,816
Controller.

917
00:28:26,306 --> 00:28:27,846
When my user logs in with

918
00:28:27,846 --> 00:28:29,866
SampleChat, they redirect to a

919
00:28:29,866 --> 00:28:31,546
URL scheme that my app handles.

920
00:28:32,086 --> 00:28:34,646
That gets handled in my

921
00:28:34,646 --> 00:28:36,306
AppDelegate in this method.

922
00:28:37,016 --> 00:28:37,996
And what I'm doing here is I'm

923
00:28:37,996 --> 00:28:39,216
making sure that there's a log

924
00:28:39,216 --> 00:28:40,876
in token to indicate that the

925
00:28:40,876 --> 00:28:42,796
user's authenticated, then I'm

926
00:28:42,796 --> 00:28:44,106
sending a message to elsewhere

927
00:28:44,106 --> 00:28:47,246
in my app giving it that token.

928
00:28:48,286 --> 00:28:49,366
I'm handling that here.

929
00:28:50,286 --> 00:28:51,546
And I'm doing that because I

930
00:28:51,546 --> 00:28:52,556
like to keep this code

931
00:28:52,556 --> 00:28:53,226
organized.

932
00:28:53,226 --> 00:28:54,376
I want everything related to

933
00:28:54,376 --> 00:28:56,256
Login in one place rather than

934
00:28:56,256 --> 00:28:57,206
having it in a few different

935
00:28:57,206 --> 00:28:57,836
places.

936
00:28:59,196 --> 00:29:00,176
Now that I know that the user

937
00:28:59,196 --> 00:29:00,176
Now that I know that the user

938
00:29:00,176 --> 00:29:02,106
has successfully logged in, I

939
00:29:02,936 --> 00:29:04,126
can change the

940
00:29:04,126 --> 00:29:05,796
dismissButtonStyle of Safari

941
00:29:05,796 --> 00:29:07,906
View Controller to Done instead

942
00:29:07,906 --> 00:29:08,536
of Cancel.

943
00:29:10,356 --> 00:29:11,226
So, I'll rebuild and I'll show

944
00:29:11,226 --> 00:29:12,616
you how this all comes together

945
00:29:12,616 --> 00:29:13,526
in Pizza Stories.

946
00:29:24,076 --> 00:29:26,566
Now, when I tap Log In, Safari

947
00:29:26,566 --> 00:29:27,246
View Controller is still

948
00:29:27,246 --> 00:29:28,666
presented from bottom to top and

949
00:29:28,666 --> 00:29:29,746
the button initially does say

950
00:29:29,746 --> 00:29:30,216
Cancel.

951
00:29:31,506 --> 00:29:32,896
With just a couple taps I can

952
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:35,896
use AutoFill to log in.

953
00:29:36,116 --> 00:29:37,716
Now, SampleChat is asking the

954
00:29:37,716 --> 00:29:39,856
user if they want to allow this

955
00:29:39,856 --> 00:29:41,826
app, in this case Pizza Stories,

956
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:43,626
to use their account for their

957
00:29:43,626 --> 00:29:45,476
friends list and their email.

958
00:29:45,476 --> 00:29:46,956
I'll allow that.

959
00:29:47,996 --> 00:29:49,466
And now that I'm logged in, the

960
00:29:49,466 --> 00:29:51,606
Done button, the Dismiss button

961
00:29:51,606 --> 00:29:53,056
has changed to say Done to

962
00:29:53,056 --> 00:29:54,636
better indicate to my users it's

963
00:29:54,636 --> 00:29:56,426
okay to dismiss now.

966
00:30:01,186 --> 00:30:04,046
Thanks. So, when I dismiss, now

967
00:30:04,046 --> 00:30:05,346
I get all of my friends showing

968
00:30:05,346 --> 00:30:06,996
up in my, and I can see all

969
00:30:06,996 --> 00:30:07,836
their stories.

970
00:30:08,586 --> 00:30:09,596
This might make me crave some

971
00:30:09,596 --> 00:30:10,496
pizza later on though.

972
00:30:11,436 --> 00:30:14,766
Thanks, and this is how easy it

973
00:30:14,766 --> 00:30:16,106
is to customize Safari View

974
00:30:16,106 --> 00:30:17,946
Controller using the new APIs in

975
00:30:18,046 --> 00:30:20,346
iOS 11 to tailor it to your app

976
00:30:20,606 --> 00:30:21,546
and make a great log in

977
00:30:21,546 --> 00:30:22,266
experience.

978
00:30:22,766 --> 00:30:23,876
Thank you so much and I'll hand

979
00:30:23,876 --> 00:30:24,656
it back over to Chelsea.

[ Applause ]

981
00:30:30,766 --> 00:30:31,746
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Louie.

982
00:30:32,116 --> 00:30:33,566
I think Louie is going to making

983
00:30:33,566 --> 00:30:35,026
a lot of dough off that one.

984
00:30:37,556 --> 00:30:38,706
[laughter] Louie just showed you

985
00:30:38,816 --> 00:30:40,746
how with a few key improvements,

986
00:30:41,096 --> 00:30:42,726
he made, he took his log in flow

987
00:30:42,726 --> 00:30:43,946
with Safari View Controller to

988
00:30:43,946 --> 00:30:44,786
the next level.

989
00:30:45,636 --> 00:30:47,736
He did this by using a custom

990
00:30:47,736 --> 00:30:50,006
presentation style that it felt

991
00:30:50,006 --> 00:30:51,706
more like the presentation style

992
00:30:51,706 --> 00:30:52,156
in his app.

993
00:30:53,736 --> 00:30:55,286
He changed the Dismiss button to

994
00:30:55,286 --> 00:30:57,256
say Cancel so that users know

995
00:30:57,636 --> 00:30:59,096
that if they tap that button

996
00:30:59,096 --> 00:31:00,566
they'll be cancelling log in

997
00:30:59,096 --> 00:31:00,566
they'll be cancelling log in

998
00:31:00,566 --> 00:31:01,846
with the third-party service

999
00:31:01,846 --> 00:31:03,996
he's asking them to log in with.

1000
00:31:05,426 --> 00:31:07,066
He turned off bar collapsing.

1001
00:31:07,236 --> 00:31:08,646
This way if the user reads the

1002
00:31:08,646 --> 00:31:10,456
Terms of Service and decides

1003
00:31:10,456 --> 00:31:11,616
that they don't want to use that

1004
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:13,106
service, they can quickly tap

1005
00:31:13,106 --> 00:31:14,716
cancel to exit Safari View

1006
00:31:14,716 --> 00:31:15,316
Controller.

1007
00:31:15,886 --> 00:31:19,516
And he changed the button to say

1008
00:31:19,516 --> 00:31:21,376
Done once the user had allowed

1009
00:31:21,376 --> 00:31:22,716
access to that third-party

1010
00:31:22,716 --> 00:31:23,106
service.

1011
00:31:23,696 --> 00:31:25,176
This way they know that they've

1012
00:31:25,236 --> 00:31:26,356
finished logging in.

1013
00:31:26,866 --> 00:31:30,726
One of the main things that we

1014
00:31:30,726 --> 00:31:31,926
want you to get out of this

1015
00:31:31,986 --> 00:31:34,316
presentation is that we hear

1016
00:31:34,316 --> 00:31:34,616
you.

1017
00:31:35,766 --> 00:31:37,176
The new APIs that we've talked

1018
00:31:37,176 --> 00:31:39,356
about today were inspired by

1019
00:31:39,486 --> 00:31:40,496
feedback from you.

1020
00:31:41,476 --> 00:31:43,096
We really encourage you to keep

1021
00:31:43,096 --> 00:31:45,016
giving us feature requests and

1022
00:31:45,016 --> 00:31:46,226
filing bug reports.

1023
00:31:47,046 --> 00:31:48,506
And also letting us know if

1024
00:31:48,546 --> 00:31:49,266
there are any other

1025
00:31:49,266 --> 00:31:51,026
customizations you'd like to see

1026
00:31:51,136 --> 00:31:52,416
in Safari View Controller.

1027
00:31:53,496 --> 00:31:54,636
So, keep talking to us.

1028
00:31:57,026 --> 00:32:00,916
In summary, Safari View

1029
00:31:57,026 --> 00:32:00,916
In summary, Safari View

1030
00:32:00,916 --> 00:32:03,786
Controller gives you an easy

1031
00:32:03,786 --> 00:32:05,566
in-app web browsing experience.

1032
00:32:05,896 --> 00:32:07,026
With just a couple lines of

1033
00:32:07,026 --> 00:32:08,986
code, you can get Safari View

1034
00:32:08,986 --> 00:32:10,716
Controller up and running in

1035
00:32:10,716 --> 00:32:11,386
your app.

1036
00:32:12,876 --> 00:32:14,206
Safari View Controller is

1037
00:32:14,346 --> 00:32:15,816
perfect for authenticating with

1038
00:32:15,816 --> 00:32:17,966
third-party services because it

1039
00:32:17,966 --> 00:32:19,636
provides a security that users

1040
00:32:19,636 --> 00:32:21,396
need and the features that they

1041
00:32:21,396 --> 00:32:24,686
love while getting logged in.

1042
00:32:26,176 --> 00:32:27,876
There are many improvements to

1043
00:32:27,876 --> 00:32:29,476
Safari View Controller on iOS

1044
00:32:29,476 --> 00:32:30,056

1045
00:32:30,536 --> 00:32:31,806
Safari View Controller's new

1046
00:32:31,806 --> 00:32:33,686
look and the new APIs that we've

1047
00:32:33,686 --> 00:32:35,806
introduced can help Safari View

1048
00:32:35,806 --> 00:32:37,616
Controller feel at home in your

1049
00:32:37,986 --> 00:32:38,053
app.

1050
00:32:40,266 --> 00:32:41,926
If you've taken a look at Safari

1051
00:32:41,926 --> 00:32:43,806
View Controller in the past but

1052
00:32:43,806 --> 00:32:45,216
maybe it didn't quite fit your

1053
00:32:45,216 --> 00:32:46,936
use case, we encourage you to

1054
00:32:46,936 --> 00:32:47,806
take another look.

1055
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:50,666
These improvements on iOS 11 and

1056
00:32:50,906 --> 00:32:52,546
the APIs that have been added

1057
00:32:52,756 --> 00:32:53,786
were inspired by you.

1058
00:32:54,656 --> 00:32:55,666
So, we really hope there's

1059
00:32:55,666 --> 00:32:57,756
something in there for you.
