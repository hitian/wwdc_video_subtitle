00:00:21,366 --> 00:00:21,976
&gt;&gt; Hello!

2
00:00:22,516 --> 00:00:27,686
[ Applause ]

3
00:00:28,186 --> 00:00:28,916
Thanks for being here.

4
00:00:31,056 --> 00:00:32,366
Thanks for spending part of your

5
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:34,206
WWDC with us, talking about

6
00:00:34,476 --> 00:00:36,116
teaching with Swift Playgrounds.

7
00:00:36,566 --> 00:00:37,886
My name's Bill Dudney, I'll be

8
00:00:37,886 --> 00:00:39,466
joined shortly by my colleague,

9
00:00:39,466 --> 00:00:41,316
Elizabeth, to talk about

10
00:00:41,766 --> 00:00:43,076
teaching with Swift Playgrounds.

11
00:00:43,386 --> 00:00:44,906
So, you might have noticed, over

12
00:00:44,906 --> 00:00:46,546
the last few years we started

13
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:48,116
with Hour of Code, and even some

14
00:00:48,116 --> 00:00:49,656
initiatives before that, that

15
00:00:49,656 --> 00:00:51,526
the whole world is now talking

16
00:00:51,526 --> 00:00:53,606
about people learning about

17
00:00:53,606 --> 00:00:55,416
computational thinking, about

18
00:00:55,416 --> 00:00:56,376
how to program.

19
00:00:56,766 --> 00:00:59,276
In India, in Asia, and Africa,

20
00:00:59,276 --> 00:01:00,746
and the United States.

21
00:00:59,276 --> 00:01:00,746
and the United States.

22
00:01:00,896 --> 00:01:02,276
There's big school systems like

23
00:01:02,276 --> 00:01:03,876
New York and Chicago talking

24
00:01:03,876 --> 00:01:05,346
about teaching all of their kids

25
00:01:05,346 --> 00:01:05,946
how to code.

26
00:01:06,776 --> 00:01:08,356
Even heffalumps are learning how

27
00:01:08,356 --> 00:01:08,796
to code.

28
00:01:09,146 --> 00:01:10,856
Everywhere, everybody is

29
00:01:10,856 --> 00:01:11,856
learning how to code.

30
00:01:12,626 --> 00:01:14,536
And, we are really excited about

31
00:01:14,536 --> 00:01:14,836
that.

32
00:01:14,836 --> 00:01:17,146
It's such a fantastic time to be

33
00:01:17,146 --> 00:01:19,426
in a place where, to be in a

34
00:01:19,426 --> 00:01:20,746
time, where everyone is starting

35
00:01:20,746 --> 00:01:21,746
to talk about coding.

36
00:01:21,746 --> 00:01:24,956
So, our talk today is divided

37
00:01:24,956 --> 00:01:26,416
into two major sections.

38
00:01:26,476 --> 00:01:27,286
The first one, I'm going to

39
00:01:27,286 --> 00:01:28,686
cover, talking about teaching,

40
00:01:28,816 --> 00:01:29,996
and then Elizabeth is going to

41
00:01:29,996 --> 00:01:31,166
talk about designing and

42
00:01:31,166 --> 00:01:32,416
implementing playgrounds.

43
00:01:33,096 --> 00:01:34,406
But, those two sections have

44
00:01:34,446 --> 00:01:35,946
three main pillars in them.

45
00:01:35,946 --> 00:01:38,876
Goal, passion, and audience.

46
00:01:39,686 --> 00:01:41,606
So, let's get started with

47
00:01:41,606 --> 00:01:43,586
teaching, and specifically about

48
00:01:43,586 --> 00:01:44,236
the goal.

49
00:01:44,606 --> 00:01:46,636
Now, as a teacher, you of course

50
00:01:46,636 --> 00:01:47,586
have to have a goal.

51
00:01:47,586 --> 00:01:48,996
What information is it that you

52
00:01:48,996 --> 00:01:50,616
want to impart to your learners.

53
00:01:51,266 --> 00:01:52,916
But, equally important, is your

54
00:01:52,916 --> 00:01:53,836
learner's goal.

55
00:01:54,206 --> 00:01:55,496
What is it that your learner is

56
00:01:55,496 --> 00:01:56,446
trying to get out of that

57
00:01:56,446 --> 00:01:56,946
content?

58
00:01:57,276 --> 00:02:00,116
They need their goal to be front

59
00:01:57,276 --> 00:02:00,116
They need their goal to be front

60
00:02:00,116 --> 00:02:01,766
and center of the content so

61
00:02:01,766 --> 00:02:02,996
that they stay motivated,

62
00:02:03,366 --> 00:02:04,276
because while learning to

63
00:02:04,276 --> 00:02:06,476
program is not hard, it does

64
00:02:06,476 --> 00:02:07,506
take hard work.

65
00:02:08,145 --> 00:02:11,986
So, a place where I'm sure many

66
00:02:11,986 --> 00:02:14,566
of us have been with mathematics

67
00:02:14,566 --> 00:02:17,226
is to either love it, or not,

68
00:02:17,226 --> 00:02:19,296
and I'm sure we all have friends

69
00:02:19,586 --> 00:02:20,116
who don't.

70
00:02:20,516 --> 00:02:22,116
As programmers, probably most of

71
00:02:22,116 --> 00:02:24,446
us are into mathematics.

72
00:02:24,446 --> 00:02:25,706
We've at least played with it,

73
00:02:25,706 --> 00:02:26,846
and done some stuff with it.

74
00:02:27,376 --> 00:02:28,626
The people who don't get it

75
00:02:28,626 --> 00:02:31,296
though, are often, or who aren't

76
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:33,316
excited by mathematics are often

77
00:02:33,796 --> 00:02:35,316
turned off by it, by some

78
00:02:35,316 --> 00:02:36,556
experience where they end up

79
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:38,126
with this long list of

80
00:02:38,126 --> 00:02:38,616
functions.

81
00:02:39,056 --> 00:02:42,166
Polynomials, trig, exponentials,

82
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:43,846
logarithms, their inverses.

83
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:45,506
Solving for "x."

84
00:02:46,016 --> 00:02:48,176
I remember, when I was younger,

85
00:02:48,336 --> 00:02:50,206
and sitting in my geometry class

86
00:02:50,206 --> 00:02:52,256
with my teacher, Mr. Carlin, I

87
00:02:52,256 --> 00:02:54,246
would ask him, probably once a

88
00:02:54,246 --> 00:02:57,266
week, I was a real pest, "When

89
00:02:57,266 --> 00:02:59,976
am I ever going to use this?"

90
00:03:00,466 --> 00:03:01,566
And, he would look at me and

91
00:03:01,566 --> 00:03:03,606
say, "Please stop asking me that

92
00:03:03,606 --> 00:03:03,996
question."

93
00:03:04,496 --> 00:03:06,286
And, eventually, after I've

94
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:07,716
pestered him enough, he said,

95
00:03:07,806 --> 00:03:09,506
"Look, you're probably never

96
00:03:09,506 --> 00:03:11,226
going to use this, but it's

97
00:03:11,226 --> 00:03:13,796
really cool anyway," and that

98
00:03:13,796 --> 00:03:15,396
sort of flipped a bit in my head

99
00:03:15,396 --> 00:03:17,276
to go from looking at math as

100
00:03:17,276 --> 00:03:19,476
utilitarian, to looking at math

101
00:03:19,476 --> 00:03:20,926
as something that's beautiful

102
00:03:20,926 --> 00:03:22,546
and fun to mess with, like a

103
00:03:22,546 --> 00:03:24,076
puzzle to solve.

104
00:03:24,406 --> 00:03:26,106
And so, that really struck me,

105
00:03:26,106 --> 00:03:28,346
and it turned my direction away

106
00:03:28,346 --> 00:03:29,766
from being frustrated with not

107
00:03:29,766 --> 00:03:30,796
having some practical

108
00:03:30,796 --> 00:03:32,966
application for it, to enjoying

109
00:03:32,966 --> 00:03:34,496
it just to solve puzzles.

110
00:03:34,496 --> 00:03:36,376
Now, of course, little did Mr.

111
00:03:36,376 --> 00:03:37,326
Carlin know, that I would

112
00:03:37,326 --> 00:03:39,436
eventually become a nerd, and

113
00:03:39,626 --> 00:03:41,106
deal with geometry all the time,

114
00:03:41,106 --> 00:03:42,526
so thank you, Mr. Carlin, for

115
00:03:42,526 --> 00:03:44,156
teaching me geometry despite my

116
00:03:44,156 --> 00:03:44,716
resistance.

117
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:50,106
[ Applause ]

118
00:03:50,606 --> 00:03:51,776
So I have a couple of examples

119
00:03:51,776 --> 00:03:53,396
that I use to try to explain

120
00:03:53,396 --> 00:03:54,746
this concept to people, because

121
00:03:54,746 --> 00:03:56,376
I think it's so important that

122
00:03:56,376 --> 00:03:57,596
we think through this, when

123
00:03:57,596 --> 00:03:58,946
we're thinking about teaching.

124
00:03:59,346 --> 00:04:00,576
Now, imagine you're trying to

125
00:03:59,346 --> 00:04:00,576
Now, imagine you're trying to

126
00:04:00,576 --> 00:04:02,696
learn how to do art.

127
00:04:03,406 --> 00:04:05,786
But instead of being artistic,

128
00:04:05,786 --> 00:04:07,156
and spreading paint around a

129
00:04:07,156 --> 00:04:09,196
canvas, instead, you're

130
00:04:09,696 --> 00:04:12,026
encouraged, or forced, to study

131
00:04:12,406 --> 00:04:14,136
the texture of colors, or the

132
00:04:14,136 --> 00:04:15,976
look of the color, or the shape

133
00:04:15,976 --> 00:04:18,005
of the brush, but never able to

134
00:04:18,005 --> 00:04:18,946
apply that paint.

135
00:04:19,216 --> 00:04:20,726
It would be really hard to stay

136
00:04:20,726 --> 00:04:22,386
focused on learning to become an

137
00:04:22,386 --> 00:04:24,286
artist when you can't do art.

138
00:04:24,616 --> 00:04:26,726
People want to create, they want

139
00:04:26,726 --> 00:04:28,056
to build things, or they want to

140
00:04:28,056 --> 00:04:28,786
make things.

141
00:04:29,286 --> 00:04:30,986
And, if you had to study that,

142
00:04:30,986 --> 00:04:32,226
it would be very difficult to

143
00:04:32,226 --> 00:04:33,416
get through it.

144
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:34,896
So much better to let people,

145
00:04:34,896 --> 00:04:36,126
when they're learning to paint

146
00:04:36,396 --> 00:04:38,336
to make a mess, smear the paint

147
00:04:38,336 --> 00:04:39,456
all over the place without

148
00:04:39,456 --> 00:04:41,276
concern, really, for what it

149
00:04:41,276 --> 00:04:41,796
looks like.

150
00:04:42,016 --> 00:04:43,396
You can worry about that later.

151
00:04:44,056 --> 00:04:45,186
Same thing with music.

152
00:04:45,186 --> 00:04:46,646
Imagine if you had to know what

153
00:04:46,646 --> 00:04:49,066
every dot, every line, every arc

154
00:04:49,066 --> 00:04:51,206
on this diagram meant before you

155
00:04:51,206 --> 00:04:52,906
could pick up a guitar, or start

156
00:04:52,906 --> 00:04:55,896
playing with your piano.

157
00:04:55,896 --> 00:04:57,166
It would be very difficult to

158
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:58,026
get through all that.

159
00:04:58,736 --> 00:05:00,606
So, I encourage people who are

160
00:04:58,736 --> 00:05:00,606
So, I encourage people who are

161
00:05:00,606 --> 00:05:02,136
thinking about teaching to start

162
00:05:02,136 --> 00:05:02,946
with a question.

163
00:05:03,446 --> 00:05:05,106
That question is what drives the

164
00:05:05,106 --> 00:05:06,066
learner's goal.

165
00:05:06,396 --> 00:05:08,986
From that question, the learner

166
00:05:08,986 --> 00:05:10,986
drives internal motivation to

167
00:05:10,986 --> 00:05:12,986
achieve the hard work of

168
00:05:12,986 --> 00:05:13,916
learning the material you're

169
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:15,006
trying to get across.

170
00:05:15,866 --> 00:05:17,356
Which brings us next, to the

171
00:05:17,356 --> 00:05:18,006
audience.

172
00:05:18,646 --> 00:05:20,476
It is so important that we as

173
00:05:20,566 --> 00:05:21,756
teachers think through the

174
00:05:21,756 --> 00:05:23,536
audience that we're aiming to

175
00:05:23,536 --> 00:05:24,006
reach.

176
00:05:24,386 --> 00:05:25,716
Are they brand new coders?

177
00:05:25,716 --> 00:05:27,386
Do they understand anything with

178
00:05:27,386 --> 00:05:27,776
coding?

179
00:05:28,066 --> 00:05:29,406
Or, are they moderately

180
00:05:29,406 --> 00:05:30,526
experienced and they're trying

181
00:05:30,526 --> 00:05:32,096
to gain more insight into some

182
00:05:32,096 --> 00:05:33,376
particular piece of material?

183
00:05:33,816 --> 00:05:34,916
You need to know who your

184
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:36,676
audience is and then make your

185
00:05:36,676 --> 00:05:38,676
content communicate to them.

186
00:05:40,536 --> 00:05:41,996
What I often see happening is

187
00:05:42,026 --> 00:05:44,796
people taking syntax and other

188
00:05:44,796 --> 00:05:47,056
things from a computer science

189
00:05:47,056 --> 00:05:49,166
degree in college and then sort

190
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:50,866
of moving it down to a level so

191
00:05:50,866 --> 00:05:52,796
younger people can understand

192
00:05:52,796 --> 00:05:52,926
it.

193
00:05:52,926 --> 00:05:54,516
So, you end up with this huge

194
00:05:54,576 --> 00:05:56,246
cloud of concepts that you have

195
00:05:56,246 --> 00:05:57,976
to get down, all these syntax

196
00:05:57,976 --> 00:05:58,396
items.

197
00:05:58,756 --> 00:06:00,166
Now, of course, it's very

198
00:05:58,756 --> 00:06:00,166
Now, of course, it's very

199
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:02,006
important that you understand

200
00:06:02,006 --> 00:06:04,516
syntax, you can't code without

201
00:06:04,516 --> 00:06:06,526
knowing what syntax is, so in

202
00:06:06,526 --> 00:06:07,686
Learn to Code, the way we

203
00:06:07,686 --> 00:06:09,416
approach that, is that we build

204
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:11,016
this engaging world with these

205
00:06:11,016 --> 00:06:12,706
great characters and these silly

206
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:14,766
animations, and beautiful audio

207
00:06:15,306 --> 00:06:17,766
to engage the learner so that

208
00:06:17,766 --> 00:06:19,046
they'll go through the hard work

209
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:20,676
of learning what a for loop is.

210
00:06:20,926 --> 00:06:22,276
Here's an example of one puzzle

211
00:06:22,276 --> 00:06:23,646
that we have that takes Byte

212
00:06:23,646 --> 00:06:24,866
around the four sides of this

213
00:06:24,866 --> 00:06:26,246
world, picking up gems.

214
00:06:27,726 --> 00:06:29,036
In order to do that, you of

215
00:06:29,036 --> 00:06:30,336
course use a for loop, and we

216
00:06:30,336 --> 00:06:31,896
have that stated at the top of

217
00:06:31,896 --> 00:06:33,646
the page, but that's not the

218
00:06:33,646 --> 00:06:34,216
goal.

219
00:06:34,216 --> 00:06:35,676
The learner's goal is to pick up

220
00:06:35,726 --> 00:06:37,216
these items and to solve the

221
00:06:37,216 --> 00:06:37,786
puzzle.

222
00:06:37,786 --> 00:06:39,546
And so, we use that goal to

223
00:06:39,546 --> 00:06:41,376
drive an internal motivation to

224
00:06:41,376 --> 00:06:43,266
go and learn what a for loop is.

225
00:06:44,266 --> 00:06:45,626
The next step is often to dive

226
00:06:45,626 --> 00:06:47,596
into something like algorithms

227
00:06:47,596 --> 00:06:48,536
and data structures.

228
00:06:48,886 --> 00:06:52,216
I love all these algorithms.

229
00:06:53,556 --> 00:06:54,716
Half of these names, I looked

230
00:06:54,716 --> 00:06:56,196
and thought, Hmm, I wonder what

231
00:06:56,196 --> 00:06:57,366
that is, and I almost got

232
00:06:57,366 --> 00:06:58,566
distracted from prepping my

233
00:06:58,566 --> 00:06:59,996

00:07:08,786 --> 00:07:09,876
have interacted with younger

00:07:09,876 --> 00:07:12,626
people, but I doubt very

241
00:07:12,626 --> 00:07:14,196
seriously-- well, many of you

242

are much younger than me, I

you with a bucket of integers

247

wish you would help me sort

That's never happened.

251
00:07:29,056 --> 00:07:30,916
No one wants to learn about

252
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:32,626
sorting, they have a goal and

253
00:07:32,626 --> 00:07:33,966
sorting will help them achieve

254
00:07:33,966 --> 00:07:35,226
that goal, so you want to focus

255
00:07:35,226 --> 00:07:38,246
on the audience's goals and then

256
00:07:38,246 --> 00:07:39,766
help them achieve those goals.

we're thinking about using those

concepts to teach people, we

263
00:07:50,516 --> 00:07:52,026
build this content like this

264
00:07:52,026 --> 00:07:53,466
same simple puzzle that we saw

265
00:07:53,466 --> 00:07:54,846
earlier, that's drawing the

266
00:07:54,846 --> 00:07:56,536
learner in to thinking about

267
00:07:56,536 --> 00:07:58,286
what an algorithm is, without

268
00:07:58,286 --> 00:07:59,386
even using the word.

00:08:00,116 --> 00:08:01,856
Then, later when we get close to

00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:04,116
the end of Learn to Code 1, we

271
00:08:04,116 --> 00:08:05,276
approach this puzzle.

272
00:08:06,446 --> 00:08:08,476
This puzzle is a challenge page

273
00:08:08,736 --> 00:08:10,606
and says to the learner, Hey, go

274
00:08:10,606 --> 00:08:11,096
nuts.

275
00:08:11,196 --> 00:08:12,626
Solve this in any way that you

276
00:08:12,626 --> 00:08:14,516
want to in the most efficient

277
00:08:14,516 --> 00:08:16,036
way that you see possible.

278
00:08:16,586 --> 00:08:18,476
But, this is after a long time

279
00:08:18,476 --> 00:08:19,636
of solving these puzzles where

280
00:08:19,636 --> 00:08:21,306
they start to understand and

281
00:08:21,406 --> 00:08:23,046
think algorithmically, so they

282
00:08:23,046 --> 00:08:24,346
look at this and think, Oh,

283
00:08:24,346 --> 00:08:25,686
there's two diamonds, or there's

284
00:08:25,686 --> 00:08:27,716
two gems, and there's two things

285
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:28,346
I need to flip.

286
00:08:28,346 --> 00:08:31,056
And, that's just programming the

287
00:08:31,056 --> 00:08:31,796
easy parts.

288
00:08:32,586 --> 00:08:33,895
In the beginning, when I started

289
00:08:33,895 --> 00:08:35,596
programming, I would not have

290
00:08:35,596 --> 00:08:37,775
built the WWDC app, properly.

291
00:08:37,905 --> 00:08:39,116
I wouldn't have made a table

292
00:08:39,116 --> 00:08:41,135
view controller and a cell and a

293
00:08:41,135 --> 00:08:41,645
model.

294
00:08:41,645 --> 00:08:42,966
I would just dump all the code

295
00:08:42,966 --> 00:08:43,926
into the view controller,

296
00:08:44,496 --> 00:08:46,906
because I read MVC when I first

297
00:08:46,906 --> 00:08:48,336
got started, and I had no idea

298
00:08:48,336 --> 00:08:49,006
what that meant.

299
00:08:49,426 --> 00:08:50,736
Modeling is difficult, the

300
00:08:50,736 --> 00:08:52,796
syntax and the algorithms, and

301
00:08:52,796 --> 00:08:54,526
so forth are the straightforward

302
00:08:54,526 --> 00:08:54,786
part.

303
00:08:56,006 --> 00:08:57,246
So, another thing that I notice

304
00:08:57,246 --> 00:08:58,926
that people get bogged down in

305
00:08:58,926 --> 00:08:59,866

on details.

Now, of course, the details,

310
00:09:04,206 --> 00:09:05,376
they're really important.

315
00:09:11,316 --> 00:09:13,766
cool, I love how fast it is, and

316
00:09:13,766 --> 00:09:14,826
the parallel nature of it.

317
00:09:15,426 --> 00:09:16,836

00:09:16,836 --> 00:09:17,286

319
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:19,726
Bought a couple of books, and

320
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:21,276
without question, every one of

I would start with fun stuff,

00:10:10,486 --> 00:10:13,786
like Byte doing his silly dance,

forth-- all of that is really

00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:16,336
Playgrounds.

383
00:11:16,376 --> 00:11:19,196
Focus on goal, audience, and

384
00:11:19,196 --> 00:11:19,686
passion.

385
00:11:20,256 --> 00:11:23,336
And, that's teaching.

386
00:11:24,096 --> 00:11:25,426
I'd like to invite Elizabeth

387
00:11:25,426 --> 00:11:26,646
onstage to talk through

388
00:11:26,646 --> 00:11:27,786
designing Swift Playgrounds.

389
00:11:27,786 --> 00:11:27,966
Thank you.

390
00:11:28,516 --> 00:11:38,546
[ Applause ]

391
00:11:39,046 --> 00:11:39,636
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Bill.

392
00:11:39,636 --> 00:11:42,206
For that awesome introduction.

393
00:11:42,266 --> 00:11:43,476
I don't even know how to follow

394
00:11:43,476 --> 00:11:44,196
his jokes.

395
00:11:45,106 --> 00:11:47,786
My name is Elizabeth, and I'm a

396
00:11:47,786 --> 00:11:50,006
content engineer, writer, and

397
00:11:50,096 --> 00:11:51,396
storyteller on the Swift

398
00:11:51,396 --> 00:11:52,376
Playgrounds team.

399
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:55,266
I'm really excited to be here

400
00:11:55,266 --> 00:11:57,496
today, the last session of WWDC

401
00:11:57,496 --> 00:12:00,346
2017 to teach you how to bring

402
00:11:57,496 --> 00:12:00,346
2017 to teach you how to bring

403
00:12:00,346 --> 00:12:03,026
those ideals: goal, audience,

404
00:12:03,226 --> 00:12:05,226
and passion into your Swift

405
00:12:05,286 --> 00:12:05,846
Playgrounds.

406
00:12:06,866 --> 00:12:07,866
So, let's start at the

407
00:12:07,866 --> 00:12:08,386
beginning.

408
00:12:09,276 --> 00:12:10,706
What is a Swift Playground?

409
00:12:11,906 --> 00:12:13,776
Some of you, all our scholarship

410
00:12:13,776 --> 00:12:16,146
students, know intimately what a

411
00:12:16,146 --> 00:12:17,556
Swift Playground is, because you

412
00:12:17,556 --> 00:12:18,886
had to make your own to get

413
00:12:18,886 --> 00:12:19,176
here.

414
00:12:20,036 --> 00:12:21,126
Others of you might have played

415
00:12:21,126 --> 00:12:22,606
with these, might have learned

416
00:12:22,606 --> 00:12:23,966
from one yourself, how the

417
00:12:23,966 --> 00:12:25,016
beginnings of coding.

418
00:12:25,626 --> 00:12:27,906
A Swift Playground is

419
00:12:27,906 --> 00:12:29,736
essentially a collection of

420
00:12:29,896 --> 00:12:31,596
pages, like this one.

421
00:12:32,156 --> 00:12:35,036
You can see on the left hand

422
00:12:35,036 --> 00:12:36,656
side, the prose section.

423
00:12:36,656 --> 00:12:39,996
At the top are the instructions,

424
00:12:40,236 --> 00:12:42,496
the story, whatever concept

425
00:12:42,496 --> 00:12:43,646
you're trying to get across to

426
00:12:43,646 --> 00:12:44,296
your learners.

427
00:12:45,016 --> 00:12:45,966
This is where you're going to

428
00:12:46,046 --> 00:12:47,176
teach them what they're about to

429
00:12:47,176 --> 00:12:47,586
do.

430
00:12:48,096 --> 00:12:50,656
On the bottom, on the right hand

431
00:12:50,656 --> 00:12:53,056
side is the user code section.

432
00:12:53,566 --> 00:12:54,646
This is the fun part where

433
00:12:54,646 --> 00:12:55,336
they're really going to be

434
00:12:55,336 --> 00:12:57,736
creating, manipulating, trying

435
00:12:57,846 --> 00:12:58,976
out what you've taught them.

436
00:12:59,426 --> 00:13:02,696
And then on the right hand side,

437
00:12:59,426 --> 00:13:02,696
And then on the right hand side,

438
00:13:03,146 --> 00:13:03,996
the live view.

439
00:13:05,066 --> 00:13:05,866
This is where you're going to

440
00:13:05,866 --> 00:13:07,696
bring your passion to this.

441
00:13:08,326 --> 00:13:09,996
Look how fun this world looks.

442
00:13:10,046 --> 00:13:11,276
I want to dive right in there

443
00:13:11,476 --> 00:13:12,916
and learn how to code in Byte's

444
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:13,316
world.

445
00:13:13,656 --> 00:13:15,366
It's colorful, it's exciting.

446
00:13:15,746 --> 00:13:17,076
This is where the learner's code

447
00:13:17,076 --> 00:13:18,456
is going to execute, where

448
00:13:18,456 --> 00:13:19,386
they're going to see what

449
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:20,376
they've created.

450
00:13:20,616 --> 00:13:22,166
This is your point, to get them

451
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:23,636
interested in whatever it is

452
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:26,896
you're trying to teach them.

453
00:13:27,116 --> 00:13:28,506
In addition to these collection

454
00:13:28,506 --> 00:13:30,016
of pages that make up a Swift

455
00:13:30,016 --> 00:13:31,616
Playground, there are a few

456
00:13:31,616 --> 00:13:33,176
other features that you can add

457
00:13:33,606 --> 00:13:35,296
to make your experiences really

458
00:13:35,296 --> 00:13:35,766
gripping.

459
00:13:40,226 --> 00:13:42,276
There we go.

460
00:13:42,506 --> 00:13:43,746
One of the first ones is

461
00:13:43,816 --> 00:13:44,486
Cutscenes.

462
00:13:44,896 --> 00:13:45,776
If you're familiar with the

463
00:13:45,776 --> 00:13:47,176
Learn to Codes, then you'll

464
00:13:47,176 --> 00:13:48,206
probably have seen some of

465
00:13:48,206 --> 00:13:48,506
these.

466
00:13:49,246 --> 00:13:50,576
We typically add them at the

467
00:13:50,576 --> 00:13:53,056
beginning of new chapters, or

468
00:13:53,056 --> 00:13:54,936
new sections, to introduce a

469
00:13:54,936 --> 00:13:57,666
concept in a fun, animated way.

470
00:13:58,296 --> 00:14:00,956
These are written in HTML, and

471
00:13:58,296 --> 00:14:00,956
These are written in HTML, and

472
00:14:00,956 --> 00:14:02,406
they're a good way to introduce

473
00:14:02,406 --> 00:14:04,196
a new topic before you dive

474
00:14:04,256 --> 00:14:05,286
straight into the code.

475
00:14:05,446 --> 00:14:06,286
Give the learner a sense of

476
00:14:06,286 --> 00:14:06,956
where it is they're going.

477
00:14:10,386 --> 00:14:12,496
You can also add hints to your

478
00:14:12,496 --> 00:14:13,116
playground books.

479
00:14:14,236 --> 00:14:16,266
These are so important for

480
00:14:16,266 --> 00:14:18,486
giving the learner a contextual

481
00:14:18,766 --> 00:14:20,316
sense of where they're going

482
00:14:20,316 --> 00:14:20,866
wrong.

483
00:14:21,616 --> 00:14:22,256
You can do a bit of

484
00:14:22,256 --> 00:14:23,576
introspecting on the learner's

485
00:14:23,576 --> 00:14:25,096
code in order to figure out

486
00:14:25,326 --> 00:14:27,036
exactly what mistake they might

487
00:14:27,036 --> 00:14:28,176
have made, and offer them

488
00:14:28,346 --> 00:14:29,126
tailored help.

489
00:14:29,626 --> 00:14:31,216
It's incredibly engaging to have

490
00:14:31,216 --> 00:14:32,916
software understand what you

491
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:34,656
need specifically instead of a

492
00:14:34,656 --> 00:14:36,396
one size fits all sort of

493
00:14:36,396 --> 00:14:37,086
experience.

494
00:14:38,016 --> 00:14:39,016
So, use hints.

495
00:14:39,806 --> 00:14:41,016
One thing to keep in mind with

496
00:14:41,016 --> 00:14:42,196
hints is that some learners

497
00:14:42,196 --> 00:14:44,476
really don't like the extra

498
00:14:44,626 --> 00:14:45,686
help, they want to do it

499
00:14:45,686 --> 00:14:46,286
themselves.

500
00:14:46,566 --> 00:14:47,876
So don't put essential

501
00:14:47,876 --> 00:14:49,246
information to solving the

502
00:14:49,246 --> 00:14:50,116
problem in here.

503
00:14:50,396 --> 00:14:51,956
Make these real hints for those

504
00:14:51,956 --> 00:14:54,396
who need them.

505
00:14:54,606 --> 00:14:56,586
If hints aren't enough, you can

506
00:14:56,586 --> 00:14:58,276
also add solutions to your

507
00:14:58,276 --> 00:14:59,246
playground pages.

508
00:14:59,996 --> 00:15:01,146
These are essential.

509
00:14:59,996 --> 00:15:01,146
These are essential.

510
00:15:01,556 --> 00:15:02,756
Think about the first time you

511
00:15:02,756 --> 00:15:03,636
were trying to learn a new

512
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:04,386
technology.

513
00:15:05,036 --> 00:15:06,246
Could you do it just with

514
00:15:06,246 --> 00:15:07,936
someone explaining conceptually?

515
00:15:08,196 --> 00:15:09,176
Or, did you need to look at a

516
00:15:09,176 --> 00:15:10,256
reference example?

517
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:12,776
These are so helpful for your

518
00:15:12,776 --> 00:15:14,076
learners that get stuck and

519
00:15:14,076 --> 00:15:15,336
aren't sure of the syntax,

520
00:15:15,406 --> 00:15:16,696
aren't sure how to go on.

521
00:15:17,036 --> 00:15:18,656
The solution gives them that

522
00:15:18,656 --> 00:15:19,576
help they need.

523
00:15:19,826 --> 00:15:20,676
Otherwise they might get

524
00:15:20,676 --> 00:15:21,916
frustrated and leave your

525
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:23,116
playground book entirely.

526
00:15:23,676 --> 00:15:28,616
You can also add assessments at

527
00:15:28,706 --> 00:15:28,886
the end.

528
00:15:29,816 --> 00:15:31,686
These typically pop up once the

529
00:15:31,686 --> 00:15:33,546
learner has completed the task

530
00:15:33,826 --> 00:15:34,626
that you've set them.

531
00:15:35,546 --> 00:15:37,106
You can also customize these

532
00:15:37,366 --> 00:15:38,926
depending on how your learner

533
00:15:38,926 --> 00:15:39,856
has solved the puzzle.

534
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:41,986
Maybe you wanted them to use for

535
00:15:41,986 --> 00:15:43,436
loops, but they used repeated

536
00:15:43,436 --> 00:15:44,476
code instead.

537
00:15:44,956 --> 00:15:46,346
Now's your chance to suggest to

538
00:15:46,346 --> 00:15:48,246
them, great job, you completed

539
00:15:48,246 --> 00:15:50,426
the puzzle, but maybe next time,

540
00:15:50,426 --> 00:15:51,406
use a for loop instead.

541
00:15:51,996 --> 00:15:53,256
It's a little bit better of a

542
00:15:53,306 --> 00:15:53,796
paradigm.

543
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:58,236
Alright. So we're all set,

544
00:15:58,286 --> 00:15:58,656
right?

545
00:15:59,056 --> 00:16:00,886
We know about pages, we know

546
00:15:59,056 --> 00:16:00,886
We know about pages, we know

547
00:16:00,886 --> 00:16:03,176
about assessments and hints,

548
00:16:03,816 --> 00:16:04,786
it's coding time.

549
00:16:06,206 --> 00:16:08,316
Not so. We went ahead to the

550
00:16:08,316 --> 00:16:09,046
drawing board.

551
00:16:10,066 --> 00:16:10,596
Literally.

552
00:16:11,436 --> 00:16:12,666
These are some of my actual

553
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:14,366
notes in the actual notebook

554
00:16:14,396 --> 00:16:16,086
that I keep when I'm designing

555
00:16:16,086 --> 00:16:17,026
for Swift Playgrounds.

556
00:16:17,596 --> 00:16:19,676
Quick sketches, just getting

557
00:16:19,676 --> 00:16:21,406
thoughts out of my brain onto

558
00:16:21,406 --> 00:16:21,976
the paper.

559
00:16:22,376 --> 00:16:23,646
I might have a thought while I'm

560
00:16:23,976 --> 00:16:25,646
riding the shuttle, or in the

561
00:16:25,646 --> 00:16:27,046
shower, and I just want to get

562
00:16:27,046 --> 00:16:28,276
that down somewhere so that I

563
00:16:28,276 --> 00:16:29,566
can iterate on it later.

564
00:16:30,446 --> 00:16:32,356
Starting out writing code, is a

565
00:16:32,356 --> 00:16:33,836
really expensive way to

566
00:16:33,836 --> 00:16:34,456
prototype.

567
00:16:34,876 --> 00:16:36,206
You might spend weeks getting a

568
00:16:36,206 --> 00:16:38,176
cool working demo ready, and

569
00:16:38,176 --> 00:16:39,476
then show it to a potential

570
00:16:39,476 --> 00:16:41,266
learner, and they are totally

571
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:43,136
lost, or they think it's boring.

572
00:16:43,526 --> 00:16:44,786
Well, now you're stuck and you

573
00:16:44,786 --> 00:16:46,686
have to redo all of those weeks

574
00:16:46,686 --> 00:16:47,426
of coding work.

575
00:16:48,096 --> 00:16:50,586
Instead, start with cheap

576
00:16:50,806 --> 00:16:51,566
prototyping.

577
00:16:52,046 --> 00:16:53,796
It's just as easy to show a set

578
00:16:53,796 --> 00:16:55,836
of storyboards on a whiteboard,

579
00:16:55,836 --> 00:16:58,266
or in a KeyNote even, to some

580
00:16:58,266 --> 00:16:59,576
potential learners, to some of

581
00:16:59,576 --> 00:17:01,296
your colleagues to get feedback

582
00:16:59,576 --> 00:17:01,296
your colleagues to get feedback

583
00:17:01,296 --> 00:17:02,576
in that initial stage.

584
00:17:06,415 --> 00:17:07,915
So we're all set now.

585
00:17:08,106 --> 00:17:10,116
We've got the main parts of the

586
00:17:10,116 --> 00:17:11,996
playground book in mind, we

587
00:17:11,996 --> 00:17:13,106
understand we want to start out

588
00:17:13,106 --> 00:17:15,596
with cheap, fast prototyping, so

589
00:17:15,596 --> 00:17:17,336
now let's take those ideals that

590
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:19,236
Bill taught us about, and put

591
00:17:19,406 --> 00:17:21,266
them into practice.

592
00:17:21,266 --> 00:17:23,036
What is the learner's goal?

593
00:17:23,116 --> 00:17:25,126
I want to take a minute here to

594
00:17:25,126 --> 00:17:27,016
help you separate in your minds

595
00:17:27,326 --> 00:17:28,506
the actual different goals that

596
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:29,236
are going on.

597
00:17:29,946 --> 00:17:31,746
There's your goal as the author.

598
00:17:32,016 --> 00:17:33,146
What do you want your learner to

599
00:17:33,146 --> 00:17:35,496
get out of the whole playground,

600
00:17:35,936 --> 00:17:38,026
and of each individual page?

601
00:17:38,676 --> 00:17:39,736
Those are separate goals.

602
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:42,346
Your learner, as well, has a

603
00:17:42,346 --> 00:17:44,966
goal on a per-page basis, and

604
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:46,496
throughout the whole playground

605
00:17:46,496 --> 00:17:46,786
book.

606
00:17:47,526 --> 00:17:49,046
For example, in Cipher, a

607
00:17:49,046 --> 00:17:50,536
cryptography-focused playground,

608
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:52,046
we released recently, the

609
00:17:52,046 --> 00:17:53,776
learner's goal is to solve the

610
00:17:53,776 --> 00:17:55,326
mystery over the course of the

611
00:17:55,326 --> 00:17:55,916
pages.

612
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:57,256
They find this encrypted note

613
00:17:57,496 --> 00:17:58,506
and want to figure out what it

614
00:17:58,506 --> 00:17:58,906
means.

615
00:17:59,736 --> 00:18:01,746
My goal as the author is to get

616
00:17:59,736 --> 00:18:01,746
My goal as the author is to get

617
00:18:01,746 --> 00:18:03,476
them interested in cryptography

618
00:18:03,476 --> 00:18:05,046
and give them a few new words,

619
00:18:05,156 --> 00:18:07,086
plain text, ciphertext, just to

620
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,526
spark that interest in a

621
00:18:08,526 --> 00:18:09,526
potential discipline.

622
00:18:10,496 --> 00:18:12,686
So, keep those goals in mind and

623
00:18:12,686 --> 00:18:14,036
figure out how you can make them

624
00:18:14,256 --> 00:18:16,156
intermarry in the best way, to

625
00:18:16,156 --> 00:18:17,496
fully support your learner in

626
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:18,226
their experience.

627
00:18:18,746 --> 00:18:22,386
So now, let's walk through some

628
00:18:22,386 --> 00:18:23,856
potential goals that you might

629
00:18:23,856 --> 00:18:25,516
have, and that we often use in

630
00:18:25,516 --> 00:18:29,316
Swift Playgrounds on each page.

631
00:18:29,546 --> 00:18:30,196
Completing a task.

632
00:18:31,126 --> 00:18:32,316
This one's probably the most

633
00:18:32,316 --> 00:18:33,846
familiar to a lot of you.

634
00:18:34,086 --> 00:18:35,336
We use this a lot in the Learn

635
00:18:35,336 --> 00:18:35,836
to Codes.

636
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:38,416
Collect all the gems, flip two

637
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:40,626
switches, and collect one gem,

638
00:18:40,856 --> 00:18:42,086
place the expert in the right

639
00:18:42,086 --> 00:18:42,416
area.

640
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:44,506
These are easy for the learner

641
00:18:44,506 --> 00:18:45,876
to understand what you want them

642
00:18:45,876 --> 00:18:46,496
to do.

643
00:18:46,726 --> 00:18:47,776
They have a clear starting

644
00:18:47,776 --> 00:18:49,826
point, a clear ending point, and

645
00:18:49,986 --> 00:18:51,036
these are easy for you to

646
00:18:51,036 --> 00:18:52,526
assess, and offer that

647
00:18:52,566 --> 00:18:53,506
personalized-- those

648
00:18:53,506 --> 00:18:55,046
personalized hints and

649
00:18:55,196 --> 00:18:58,096
assessments at the end.

650
00:18:58,096 --> 00:18:58,706
Experiment.

651
00:18:59,506 --> 00:19:00,936
I love these kind of pages,

652
00:18:59,506 --> 00:19:00,936
I love these kind of pages,

653
00:19:00,936 --> 00:19:02,486
because I like to play around

654
00:19:02,486 --> 00:19:03,496
with the code I'm given.

655
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:05,596
These are a really good way to

656
00:19:05,596 --> 00:19:07,316
introduce learners to something

657
00:19:07,316 --> 00:19:09,506
complex, to give them a sense of

658
00:19:09,506 --> 00:19:11,416
where they're going before they

659
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:12,696
dive in to the code.

660
00:19:13,776 --> 00:19:15,566
We often use this by showing a

661
00:19:15,566 --> 00:19:17,886
whole big block of code, maybe

662
00:19:17,886 --> 00:19:19,406
new functions the learner hasn't

663
00:19:19,406 --> 00:19:21,566
seen yet, maybe new variables,

664
00:19:21,566 --> 00:19:23,446
even new concepts, and then we

665
00:19:23,446 --> 00:19:24,796
minimize the amount of code

666
00:19:24,796 --> 00:19:26,216
that's actually editable to

667
00:19:26,216 --> 00:19:27,866
them, so they're not overwhelmed

668
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:29,596
by seeing, whoa, this is a lot

669
00:19:29,596 --> 00:19:30,376
of new stuff.

670
00:19:30,766 --> 00:19:32,566
Instead, they can pick out the

671
00:19:32,566 --> 00:19:33,186
parts.

672
00:19:33,186 --> 00:19:34,696
"I know how to change a color, I

673
00:19:34,696 --> 00:19:36,366
know how to change a radius to

674
00:19:36,366 --> 00:19:36,646
negative."

675
00:19:36,646 --> 00:19:38,746
And, they can experiment, and

676
00:19:38,926 --> 00:19:40,306
have fun with this thing that

677
00:19:40,306 --> 00:19:41,556
they're about to dive more

678
00:19:41,556 --> 00:19:42,436
deeply into.

679
00:19:44,376 --> 00:19:45,926
Practicing a new skill.

680
00:19:46,036 --> 00:19:48,816
I'm hoping you all practice a

681
00:19:48,816 --> 00:19:49,846
new skill right now.

682
00:19:50,506 --> 00:19:52,586
Bill taught us about goal,

683
00:19:52,586 --> 00:19:54,996
audience, and passion, and I'm

684
00:19:54,996 --> 00:19:56,236
reiterating that to you now.

685
00:19:56,426 --> 00:19:57,386
So, that hopefully when you

686
00:19:57,386 --> 00:19:59,186
leave this room, you have those

687
00:19:59,226 --> 00:20:00,716
three concepts in your mind.

688
00:19:59,226 --> 00:20:00,716
three concepts in your mind.

689
00:20:02,396 --> 00:20:04,656
Learners won't grok a concept

690
00:20:04,756 --> 00:20:06,286
immediately, the first time.

691
00:20:06,636 --> 00:20:07,986
You might wish they would, but

692
00:20:07,986 --> 00:20:09,256
I'm sure through experience;

693
00:20:09,316 --> 00:20:10,496
think back to when you first

694
00:20:10,496 --> 00:20:11,566
learned a new, complicated

695
00:20:11,566 --> 00:20:11,936
thing.

696
00:20:12,346 --> 00:20:13,286
Could you have written a

697
00:20:13,286 --> 00:20:14,886
definition, explained it to one

698
00:20:14,886 --> 00:20:16,266
of your colleagues immediately?

699
00:20:16,726 --> 00:20:18,466
No, you needed to practice that

700
00:20:18,466 --> 00:20:20,066
skill, to use it in different

701
00:20:20,066 --> 00:20:22,146
contexts so that you can then go

702
00:20:22,376 --> 00:20:23,896
and apply that to some new

703
00:20:23,896 --> 00:20:24,336
place.

704
00:20:25,456 --> 00:20:26,736
So, really important to include

705
00:20:26,736 --> 00:20:28,226
these types of pages in your

706
00:20:28,226 --> 00:20:29,446
playground book.

707
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:32,606
Think about a concept.

708
00:20:33,896 --> 00:20:35,236
This one is sort of different.

709
00:20:35,956 --> 00:20:37,636
We talk a lot about code and the

710
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:39,566
learner code on each page, but

711
00:20:39,566 --> 00:20:41,176
often in the Learn to Codes and

712
00:20:41,176 --> 00:20:42,486
the challenges in all of your

713
00:20:42,536 --> 00:20:43,646
playground books, you're

714
00:20:43,646 --> 00:20:45,386
introducing something totally

715
00:20:45,616 --> 00:20:46,106
new.

716
00:20:46,516 --> 00:20:48,016
In the cryptography playground,

717
00:20:48,016 --> 00:20:49,526
I'm introducing all of

718
00:20:49,526 --> 00:20:50,646
cryptography, and there's

719
00:20:50,696 --> 00:20:52,036
complicated words like

720
00:20:52,086 --> 00:20:54,216
ciphertext and key and message.

721
00:20:54,616 --> 00:20:56,276
That's a lot of new information

722
00:20:56,276 --> 00:20:57,636
for a learner to take in.

723
00:20:58,266 --> 00:20:59,256
And, you want to make sure you

724
00:20:59,256 --> 00:21:00,406
give them that space.

725
00:20:59,256 --> 00:21:00,406
give them that space.

726
00:21:00,886 --> 00:21:04,956
To read, understand, and reflect

727
00:21:05,436 --> 00:21:06,526
on what you're telling them.

728
00:21:07,356 --> 00:21:08,866
We have several pages that don't

729
00:21:08,866 --> 00:21:10,606
have any user coding on a page,

730
00:21:11,026 --> 00:21:12,276
because those pages are

731
00:21:12,406 --> 00:21:13,316
concept-heavy.

732
00:21:13,696 --> 00:21:14,896
And, we want to give the learner

733
00:21:15,976 --> 00:21:18,256
that space.

734
00:21:18,456 --> 00:21:19,806
Finally, create.

735
00:21:20,336 --> 00:21:21,686
These pages are awesome.

736
00:21:22,206 --> 00:21:23,226
This is where you really get to

737
00:21:23,226 --> 00:21:24,826
show your skills, show what

738
00:21:24,826 --> 00:21:25,516
you've learned.

739
00:21:26,296 --> 00:21:28,126
We've given you, the author, all

740
00:21:28,126 --> 00:21:30,426
the tools you need, and now the

741
00:21:30,426 --> 00:21:32,456
learner is able to go nuts.

742
00:21:33,246 --> 00:21:34,526
They know how to change colors,

743
00:21:34,526 --> 00:21:36,296
they know how to add functions,

744
00:21:36,296 --> 00:21:37,846
they can make the robot dance,

745
00:21:37,846 --> 00:21:38,876
but they couldn't before.

746
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:40,566
This is their chance to really

747
00:21:40,566 --> 00:21:42,656
explore, and to feel empowered.

748
00:21:42,656 --> 00:21:44,126
This is why they came to coding.

749
00:21:44,596 --> 00:21:45,926
Why did you all come to coding?

750
00:21:46,306 --> 00:21:47,366
Probably to do something.

751
00:21:47,366 --> 00:21:48,176
To learn something.

752
00:21:48,176 --> 00:21:49,326
To create something.

753
00:21:49,806 --> 00:21:51,176
Keep that in mind, that that's

754
00:21:51,176 --> 00:21:52,396
likely what's in your learners'

755
00:21:52,396 --> 00:21:53,166
minds too.

756
00:21:53,306 --> 00:21:54,146
That they want to create

757
00:21:54,216 --> 00:21:54,696
something.

758
00:21:55,106 --> 00:21:56,006
And so, give them that

759
00:21:56,006 --> 00:21:56,716
opportunity.

760
00:21:57,446 --> 00:21:59,346
Include a wide variety of these

761
00:21:59,456 --> 00:22:00,676
types of pages in your

762
00:21:59,456 --> 00:22:00,676
types of pages in your

763
00:22:00,676 --> 00:22:02,126
playgrounds, and you'll keep

764
00:22:02,126 --> 00:22:03,356
your learners engaged,

765
00:22:03,536 --> 00:22:04,936
interested, and excited for

766
00:22:04,936 --> 00:22:06,346
what's coming next.

767
00:22:08,116 --> 00:22:09,746
So, how do we do all of this?

768
00:22:09,936 --> 00:22:12,226
How do we get the learner to

769
00:22:12,226 --> 00:22:12,936
these places?

770
00:22:12,936 --> 00:22:14,276
How to create these pages?

771
00:22:15,156 --> 00:22:17,296
Well, in Swift Playgrounds

772
00:22:17,296 --> 00:22:19,086
itself, you have several prose

773
00:22:19,116 --> 00:22:22,386
tools available to you.

774
00:22:22,596 --> 00:22:24,706
Number one is glossary entries.

775
00:22:25,956 --> 00:22:27,446
These are incredibly important

776
00:22:27,566 --> 00:22:29,006
especially when thinking about

777
00:22:29,006 --> 00:22:30,196
your audience.

778
00:22:30,466 --> 00:22:31,456
Another one of those big,

779
00:22:31,456 --> 00:22:32,146
important points.

780
00:22:33,206 --> 00:22:35,426
Algorithm might be a simple word

781
00:22:35,516 --> 00:22:37,266
for all of you, many of you.

782
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:38,706
You're coders, you're

783
00:22:38,706 --> 00:22:40,416
programmers, you've been around

784
00:22:40,416 --> 00:22:42,586
the block, and you know what an

785
00:22:42,586 --> 00:22:43,306
algorithm is.

786
00:22:44,076 --> 00:22:45,706
But, a beginner, who's brand new

787
00:22:45,706 --> 00:22:47,256
to coding, that's a difficult

788
00:22:47,256 --> 00:22:47,626
word.

789
00:22:48,076 --> 00:22:49,626
Something they can't just intuit

790
00:22:49,626 --> 00:22:50,646
from reading the rest of your

791
00:22:50,646 --> 00:22:51,156
prose.

792
00:22:51,576 --> 00:22:53,016
And so, offering this glossary

793
00:22:53,016 --> 00:22:54,686
entry, which is triggered in

794
00:22:54,686 --> 00:22:55,866
Swift Playgrounds just by

795
00:22:55,866 --> 00:22:57,026
tapping on that differently

796
00:22:57,026 --> 00:22:58,756
colored word, gives them the

797
00:22:58,756 --> 00:23:00,806
support they need to keep on

798
00:22:58,756 --> 00:23:00,806
support they need to keep on

799
00:23:00,806 --> 00:23:01,996
with your playground book.

800
00:23:02,836 --> 00:23:04,486
Keep in mind, you, as the

801
00:23:04,486 --> 00:23:05,966
author, are not going to be

802
00:23:05,966 --> 00:23:07,386
there to pop out of the page,

803
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:08,956
and tell your learner something

804
00:23:08,956 --> 00:23:09,886
when they're having trouble.

805
00:23:10,306 --> 00:23:11,996
You need to communicate solely

806
00:23:11,996 --> 00:23:13,156
via the medium of text.

807
00:23:13,916 --> 00:23:15,136
And so, you want to use all the

808
00:23:15,136 --> 00:23:16,806
tools at your disposal to give

809
00:23:16,806 --> 00:23:18,206
extra help where it's needed,

810
00:23:18,686 --> 00:23:20,536
and support your learner in

811
00:23:20,536 --> 00:23:21,046
their process.

812
00:23:21,986 --> 00:23:23,816
A great way to figure out what

813
00:23:23,816 --> 00:23:25,436
kinds of glossary entries you're

814
00:23:25,436 --> 00:23:27,196
going to need is by user

815
00:23:27,196 --> 00:23:27,786
testing.

816
00:23:28,306 --> 00:23:29,776
Put this in the prototyping

817
00:23:29,776 --> 00:23:31,186
stage when you get some prose

818
00:23:31,186 --> 00:23:32,406
written down in front of

819
00:23:32,406 --> 00:23:34,526
learners, and listen to them.

820
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:35,566
What words don't they

821
00:23:35,566 --> 00:23:36,236
understand?

822
00:23:36,546 --> 00:23:37,846
What concept did they clearly

823
00:23:37,846 --> 00:23:39,136
not get because they skipped

824
00:23:39,136 --> 00:23:40,366
over a vocab word?

825
00:23:40,576 --> 00:23:41,706
And, include these in your

826
00:23:41,706 --> 00:23:42,556
glossary entries.

827
00:23:43,956 --> 00:23:46,436
It's also worth noting, that, if

828
00:23:46,436 --> 00:23:47,296
you're localizing your

829
00:23:47,296 --> 00:23:48,756
playground, you can add

830
00:23:48,756 --> 00:23:50,346
additional glossary entries in

831
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:51,916
different localized languages.

832
00:23:52,336 --> 00:23:53,466
So, that if there's something

833
00:23:53,686 --> 00:23:55,226
jargon-y that maybe an English

834
00:23:55,226 --> 00:23:56,676
speaker would understand, you

835
00:23:56,676 --> 00:23:58,336
can offer a glossary entry to

836
00:23:58,396 --> 00:24:00,066
that in another language.

837
00:23:58,396 --> 00:24:00,066
that in another language.

838
00:24:00,586 --> 00:24:02,356
So, keep that in mind.

839
00:24:03,946 --> 00:24:07,276
Take a minute to read this

840
00:24:07,316 --> 00:24:07,976
definition.

841
00:24:14,546 --> 00:24:15,946
You all feel confident about

842
00:24:15,946 --> 00:24:17,016
substitution ciphers?

843
00:24:17,406 --> 00:24:18,416
You could send me a message

844
00:24:18,416 --> 00:24:20,126
right now in substitution cipher

845
00:24:20,126 --> 00:24:21,076
with a shift of 3?

846
00:24:21,616 --> 00:24:24,326
What about if I also gave you

847
00:24:24,326 --> 00:24:25,246
this diagram?

848
00:24:26,496 --> 00:24:28,026
This is much more valuable.

849
00:24:28,866 --> 00:24:30,116
It's helpful to have both,

850
00:24:30,226 --> 00:24:30,916
definitely.

851
00:24:31,106 --> 00:24:32,416
The diagram on its own wouldn't

852
00:24:32,416 --> 00:24:34,306
do it, but just the prose

853
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:36,406
without this visual, impactful

854
00:24:36,616 --> 00:24:37,116
picture?

855
00:24:37,756 --> 00:24:38,986
Is not going to cut it either.

856
00:24:40,196 --> 00:24:42,506
It's so helpful to have visual

857
00:24:42,536 --> 00:24:44,146
aids in explaining difficult

858
00:24:44,146 --> 00:24:44,856
concepts.

859
00:24:45,446 --> 00:24:48,176
Do keep in mind, that if you add

860
00:24:48,176 --> 00:24:49,776
visual aids, which you can add

861
00:24:49,776 --> 00:24:51,656
in that prose section, right in

862
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:53,056
the prose, that you want to make

863
00:24:53,056 --> 00:24:54,446
sure they have accessibility

864
00:24:54,446 --> 00:24:56,526
labels, so that your users using

865
00:24:56,526 --> 00:24:58,216
VoiceOver have just as rich of

866
00:24:58,216 --> 00:25:00,046
an experience as those who are

867
00:24:58,216 --> 00:25:00,046
an experience as those who are

868
00:25:00,046 --> 00:25:00,976
not using VoiceOver.

869
00:25:05,196 --> 00:25:06,576
Here's a wall of text.

870
00:25:07,516 --> 00:25:08,736
Lots of stuff going on here.

871
00:25:09,796 --> 00:25:11,516
Luckily, there's a callout.

872
00:25:12,386 --> 00:25:13,726
I know which part of this I need

873
00:25:13,726 --> 00:25:14,596
to pay attention to.

874
00:25:14,906 --> 00:25:16,286
Right here, new awesome

875
00:25:16,286 --> 00:25:16,846
function.

876
00:25:17,176 --> 00:25:17,946
I'm ready to go.

877
00:25:18,916 --> 00:25:20,316
In a lot of our user testing,

878
00:25:21,236 --> 00:25:23,196
users, no matter what age group,

879
00:25:23,426 --> 00:25:25,336
what experience level, often

880
00:25:25,336 --> 00:25:26,436
skim the prose.

881
00:25:26,786 --> 00:25:27,866
They want to get right into

882
00:25:27,866 --> 00:25:29,766
coding, they don't care about

883
00:25:29,766 --> 00:25:31,206
all the awesome instructions

884
00:25:31,206 --> 00:25:32,646
you've given, you've slaved over

885
00:25:32,646 --> 00:25:33,146
for weeks.

886
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:34,986
They just want to get in there

887
00:25:34,986 --> 00:25:36,086
and write some code.

888
00:25:36,086 --> 00:25:37,216
And so, support that.

889
00:25:37,656 --> 00:25:39,986
Give people their tl;dr, too

890
00:25:39,986 --> 00:25:41,396
long; didn't read it version, in

891
00:25:41,396 --> 00:25:43,006
the middle so they can get right

892
00:25:43,006 --> 00:25:43,386
in there.

893
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:46,416
Still, offer them that prose

894
00:25:46,466 --> 00:25:47,636
support, around it.

895
00:25:48,096 --> 00:25:49,466
If your learner does dive right

896
00:25:49,546 --> 00:25:50,646
in, tries out new awesome

897
00:25:50,646 --> 00:25:52,096
function, and it doesn't do what

898
00:25:52,096 --> 00:25:54,036
they expected, they need to be

899
00:25:54,036 --> 00:25:56,076
able to come back and read about

900
00:25:56,076 --> 00:25:57,696
it, and find out what it does.

901
00:25:58,836 --> 00:26:00,016
It's all about supporting your

902
00:25:58,836 --> 00:26:00,016
It's all about supporting your

903
00:26:00,016 --> 00:26:01,616
learner in every aspect you

904
00:26:01,616 --> 00:26:02,926
think they might need support.

905
00:26:06,656 --> 00:26:09,066
Finally, the shortcut bar.

906
00:26:10,276 --> 00:26:11,996
This might not seem like a prose

907
00:26:11,996 --> 00:26:14,246
tool, but it's incredibly

908
00:26:14,246 --> 00:26:14,866
important.

909
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:16,716
And you, as the authors, have

910
00:26:16,716 --> 00:26:18,456
control over what appears in

911
00:26:18,456 --> 00:26:19,396
this shortcut bar.

912
00:26:20,146 --> 00:26:21,336
This is how your learner is

913
00:26:21,336 --> 00:26:22,486
going to start coding.

914
00:26:22,746 --> 00:26:23,796
This is how they're doing it on

915
00:26:23,796 --> 00:26:24,476
an iPad.

916
00:26:24,736 --> 00:26:26,696
Tapping functions, tapping

917
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:27,706
keywords.

918
00:26:28,096 --> 00:26:30,096
This is their main toolbox.

919
00:26:30,836 --> 00:26:34,216
So, make it easy to use.

920
00:26:34,366 --> 00:26:36,866
Only include relevant choices.

921
00:26:37,546 --> 00:26:39,166
If your learner's on page tw0 of

922
00:26:39,166 --> 00:26:40,616
your playground book, and you

923
00:26:40,616 --> 00:26:42,686
have functions from page six and

924
00:26:42,686 --> 00:26:44,166
seven in that shortcut bar,

925
00:26:44,816 --> 00:26:46,116
that's going to be exhausting

926
00:26:46,116 --> 00:26:46,696
and distracting.

927
00:26:46,696 --> 00:26:47,956
They're going to have to scroll

928
00:26:47,956 --> 00:26:49,826
through, finally get to the

929
00:26:49,826 --> 00:26:50,936
functions they wanted for this

930
00:26:50,936 --> 00:26:52,476
page, and wonder why they had

931
00:26:52,476 --> 00:26:53,606
all these extra functions in the

932
00:26:53,606 --> 00:26:53,936
middle.

933
00:26:54,686 --> 00:26:55,946
It might even be confusing.

934
00:26:56,526 --> 00:26:57,596
Maybe they thought they needed

935
00:26:57,596 --> 00:26:58,806
to use those other functions.

936
00:26:59,156 --> 00:27:00,186
But, they don't, and now they're

937
00:26:59,156 --> 00:27:00,186
But, they don't, and now they're

938
00:27:00,186 --> 00:27:00,866
not sure.

939
00:27:00,916 --> 00:27:01,726
And, you haven't gotten your

940
00:27:01,726 --> 00:27:03,176
point across as well as you

941
00:27:04,066 --> 00:27:06,566
might have.

942
00:27:06,766 --> 00:27:08,676
Use concise method names.

943
00:27:09,756 --> 00:27:11,166
This one can be a little tough,

944
00:27:11,456 --> 00:27:13,136
because sometimes the method's

945
00:27:13,136 --> 00:27:14,386
got to say what it's got to say,

946
00:27:14,936 --> 00:27:15,686
but do your best.

947
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:18,786
The one I have here, "shift word

948
00:27:18,786 --> 00:27:21,306
by," easy, fits on the screen,

949
00:27:21,866 --> 00:27:22,886
and it's easy for the learner to

950
00:27:22,886 --> 00:27:23,636
understand.

951
00:27:24,366 --> 00:27:25,706
Important to keep your audience

952
00:27:25,706 --> 00:27:27,006
in mind here too, in terms of

953
00:27:27,226 --> 00:27:28,806
what kind of vocabulary you're

954
00:27:28,806 --> 00:27:30,296
using in these method names.

955
00:27:30,636 --> 00:27:31,926
Your word choice is just as

956
00:27:31,926 --> 00:27:33,446
important as the concepts you're

957
00:27:33,446 --> 00:27:36,576
leading them through.

958
00:27:36,796 --> 00:27:39,256
And, finally, please provide

959
00:27:39,256 --> 00:27:40,446
common keywords.

960
00:27:41,226 --> 00:27:42,836
We all love autocomplete.

961
00:27:43,566 --> 00:27:44,706
Your learner will love it if

962
00:27:44,706 --> 00:27:46,486
they can just tap "func", tap

963
00:27:46,736 --> 00:27:48,286
"var", tap "if" to put it in

964
00:27:48,316 --> 00:27:48,456
there.

965
00:27:49,136 --> 00:27:50,716
Don't make them type those over

966
00:27:50,716 --> 00:27:51,226
and over.

967
00:27:51,616 --> 00:27:52,496
You want to focus on the

968
00:27:52,496 --> 00:27:53,666
learning, and one of the most

969
00:27:53,666 --> 00:27:55,346
important things about focusing

970
00:27:55,346 --> 00:27:57,326
on the learning is not having

971
00:27:57,356 --> 00:27:59,876
ancillary busyness going on in

972
00:27:59,876 --> 00:28:01,586
your mind of remembering, was it

973
00:27:59,876 --> 00:28:01,586
your mind of remembering, was it

974
00:28:01,586 --> 00:28:03,366
"func" with a capital F, does

975
00:28:03,366 --> 00:28:04,816
the "var"-- do I need a space

976
00:28:04,816 --> 00:28:06,336
before and after the equals?

977
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:07,516
Things like that.

978
00:28:07,606 --> 00:28:08,766
You don't want to have to deal

979
00:28:08,766 --> 00:28:09,616
with that, and your learner

980
00:28:09,616 --> 00:28:10,156
doesn't either.

981
00:28:10,796 --> 00:28:12,766
So, just provide these helpful

982
00:28:12,836 --> 00:28:14,766
things in the shortcut bar, and

983
00:28:14,766 --> 00:28:15,746
your learner will be able to

984
00:28:15,746 --> 00:28:17,246
focus on what you really want to

985
00:28:17,246 --> 00:28:18,386
teach them, and that's what

986
00:28:18,386 --> 00:28:18,766
matters.

987
00:28:19,296 --> 00:28:21,476
So, we've talked about the

988
00:28:21,476 --> 00:28:22,426
learner, a lot.

989
00:28:22,506 --> 00:28:25,156
And, that brings us to the

990
00:28:25,156 --> 00:28:26,806
second overarching point.

991
00:28:27,256 --> 00:28:28,456
Who is your learner?

992
00:28:29,146 --> 00:28:30,106
Are they a beginner?

993
00:28:30,686 --> 00:28:31,616
Are they advanced?

994
00:28:32,396 --> 00:28:33,756
Are you writing a computational

995
00:28:33,756 --> 00:28:35,566
biology playground, and showing

996
00:28:35,566 --> 00:28:36,436
it to biologists?

997
00:28:36,926 --> 00:28:37,896
Or, showing it to computer

998
00:28:37,896 --> 00:28:38,556
scientists?

999
00:28:39,286 --> 00:28:40,566
Those people are going to bring

1000
00:28:40,616 --> 00:28:42,146
totally different backgrounds

1001
00:28:42,146 --> 00:28:43,276
and experience levels.

1002
00:28:43,576 --> 00:28:44,666
And, you really need to get to

1003
00:28:44,666 --> 00:28:46,496
know your learner and understand

1004
00:28:46,496 --> 00:28:47,856
where they're coming from to

1005
00:28:47,856 --> 00:28:49,746
provide them the best, richest,

1006
00:28:50,016 --> 00:28:51,056
most supportive learning

1007
00:28:51,056 --> 00:28:51,666
experience.

1008
00:28:52,356 --> 00:28:54,386
I'm going to walk you through

1009
00:28:54,386 --> 00:28:56,596
some examples now, of pages from

1010
00:28:56,596 --> 00:28:58,376
our playground books where we

1011
00:28:58,376 --> 00:29:00,296
had goals in mind, but we also

1012
00:28:58,376 --> 00:29:00,296
had goals in mind, but we also

1013
00:29:00,296 --> 00:29:01,506
had to keep our audience

1014
00:29:01,576 --> 00:29:02,966
strongly in the forefront.

1015
00:29:05,876 --> 00:29:07,626
This is a page from Learn to

1016
00:29:07,626 --> 00:29:09,716
Code 3, where we're asking the

1017
00:29:09,716 --> 00:29:11,236
learner to add a background

1018
00:29:11,236 --> 00:29:12,356
image to the screen.

1019
00:29:12,916 --> 00:29:14,996
We say it right there.

1020
00:29:15,726 --> 00:29:17,006
Set a background image.

1021
00:29:17,006 --> 00:29:17,876
Add it to the screen.

1022
00:29:17,876 --> 00:29:19,946
And, that's because this is

1023
00:29:19,946 --> 00:29:21,146
targeted at a beginner.

1024
00:29:21,806 --> 00:29:23,846
Complete a task-style goal, like

1025
00:29:23,846 --> 00:29:25,396
we talked about from before, and

1026
00:29:25,396 --> 00:29:26,386
beginner audience.

1027
00:29:27,406 --> 00:29:29,336
Set a background image, alright,

1028
00:29:30,296 --> 00:29:31,156
I'm primed.

1029
00:29:31,266 --> 00:29:33,346
And now, right here, this is how

1030
00:29:33,346 --> 00:29:33,816
you do it.

1031
00:29:34,086 --> 00:29:36,346
scene.backgroundImage equals

1032
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:37,216
"image literal."

1033
00:29:37,606 --> 00:29:39,216
I give the learner the syntax,

1034
00:29:39,686 --> 00:29:40,946
because, again, this is targeted

1035
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:42,606
at a beginner who's not going to

1036
00:29:42,606 --> 00:29:44,196
have all that far-reaching

1037
00:29:44,196 --> 00:29:45,966
computer science knowledge, not

1038
00:29:45,966 --> 00:29:47,106
even that far-reaching.

1039
00:29:47,106 --> 00:29:48,326
To us, this seems simple.

1040
00:29:48,366 --> 00:29:49,236
Everyone knows that

1041
00:29:49,236 --> 00:29:50,696
"backgroundImage" is the name of

1042
00:29:50,696 --> 00:29:51,366
that property.

1043
00:29:51,826 --> 00:29:52,726
But a beginner doesn't.

1044
00:29:53,326 --> 00:29:54,526
And since we're all content

1045
00:29:54,526 --> 00:29:56,526
matter experts, it's really hard

1046
00:29:56,526 --> 00:29:58,296
to put ourselves in the shoes of

1047
00:29:58,296 --> 00:29:59,946
a beginner who isn't familiar

1048
00:29:59,946 --> 00:30:00,606
with the syntax.

1049
00:29:59,946 --> 00:30:00,606
with the syntax.

1050
00:30:01,476 --> 00:30:02,996
That's why user testing is so

1051
00:30:02,996 --> 00:30:03,616
important.

1052
00:30:03,756 --> 00:30:04,796
To figure out what kind of

1053
00:30:04,796 --> 00:30:06,486
logical leaps you're making,

1054
00:30:06,816 --> 00:30:08,036
that your learner needs to be

1055
00:30:08,036 --> 00:30:09,416
walked through a little more

1056
00:30:09,416 --> 00:30:09,946
slowly.

1057
00:30:10,516 --> 00:30:13,276
We then give them extremely

1058
00:30:13,276 --> 00:30:14,526
explicit instructions.

1059
00:30:15,106 --> 00:30:17,186
Write the syntax we just gave

1060
00:30:17,186 --> 00:30:19,206
you, and then choose "image

1061
00:30:19,206 --> 00:30:20,526
literal" from the shortcut bar.

1062
00:30:20,836 --> 00:30:21,966
Again, we're offering them the

1063
00:30:21,966 --> 00:30:23,176
appropriate shortcuts in the

1064
00:30:23,176 --> 00:30:24,666
bar, and then choose a

1065
00:30:24,666 --> 00:30:25,416
background image.

1066
00:30:26,046 --> 00:30:27,536
By now, you are probably all,

1067
00:30:27,536 --> 00:30:29,316
like, I know, background image,

1068
00:30:29,506 --> 00:30:30,566
I'm good, move on.

1069
00:30:30,936 --> 00:30:32,166
But, a beginner needs this

1070
00:30:32,216 --> 00:30:32,626
support.

1071
00:30:34,046 --> 00:30:35,096
Finally, we even offer a

1072
00:30:35,096 --> 00:30:35,466
comment.

1073
00:30:35,766 --> 00:30:37,126
This is where you do it, this is

1074
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:38,216
where you write the code.

1075
00:30:38,506 --> 00:30:39,716
Set background image.

1076
00:30:42,496 --> 00:30:44,656
Let's take a look at a page with

1077
00:30:44,656 --> 00:30:46,376
a similar goal, completing a

1078
00:30:46,376 --> 00:30:48,296
task, but with a totally

1079
00:30:48,296 --> 00:30:49,636
different audience in mind.

1080
00:30:51,026 --> 00:30:52,676
These are your advanced

1081
00:30:52,786 --> 00:30:53,266
learners.

1082
00:30:54,696 --> 00:30:56,286
We still have a goal statement,

1083
00:30:56,786 --> 00:30:58,116
but it's far more broad.

1084
00:30:58,906 --> 00:31:00,036
Use a breadth-first search

1085
00:30:58,906 --> 00:31:00,036
Use a breadth-first search

1086
00:31:00,036 --> 00:31:02,056
algorithm to complete the maze.

1087
00:31:02,626 --> 00:31:04,076
There are any number of ways

1088
00:31:04,076 --> 00:31:05,146
that I could complete this.

1089
00:31:05,376 --> 00:31:06,466
And, I have to have a lot of

1090
00:31:06,466 --> 00:31:07,876
knowledge in my brain already to

1091
00:31:07,906 --> 00:31:09,316
even understand what that goal

1092
00:31:09,316 --> 00:31:10,726
statement means.

1093
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:14,916
We still offer instructions, but

1094
00:31:14,916 --> 00:31:17,396
again, they're more broad, more

1095
00:31:17,396 --> 00:31:18,086
open-ended.

1096
00:31:19,326 --> 00:31:20,846
Start by adding all the tiles to

1097
00:31:20,846 --> 00:31:21,506
the queue.

1098
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:24,626
Pop those tiles.

1099
00:31:25,106 --> 00:31:27,946
And there you go.

1100
00:31:28,686 --> 00:31:32,226
And then, in the user code

1101
00:31:32,226 --> 00:31:34,296
section, we just offer an empty

1102
00:31:34,296 --> 00:31:37,166
function and ask the user to use

1103
00:31:37,166 --> 00:31:38,616
their knowledge that they

1104
00:31:38,616 --> 00:31:40,076
already have, that we've taught

1105
00:31:40,106 --> 00:31:41,776
them a little bit of, to do

1106
00:31:41,776 --> 00:31:42,036
this.

1107
00:31:42,496 --> 00:31:44,636
Totally open-ended, overwhelming

1108
00:31:44,636 --> 00:31:46,126
for a beginner, but for an

1109
00:31:46,126 --> 00:31:48,006
advanced learner, they know what

1110
00:31:48,006 --> 00:31:48,476
to do.

1111
00:31:48,476 --> 00:31:49,736
They know how to complete this

1112
00:31:49,736 --> 00:31:51,666
task, and move on with the page.

1113
00:31:56,046 --> 00:31:57,136
What about a different style of

1114
00:31:57,196 --> 00:31:57,686
page?

1115
00:31:59,336 --> 00:32:00,506
Thinking about a concept.

1116
00:31:59,336 --> 00:32:00,506
Thinking about a concept.

1117
00:32:02,316 --> 00:32:04,276
In this one, we introduce Blink,

1118
00:32:04,966 --> 00:32:06,226
related to Conway's Game of

1119
00:32:06,226 --> 00:32:07,876
Life, which is essentially a

1120
00:32:07,876 --> 00:32:09,696
cell simulator, where cells live

1121
00:32:09,696 --> 00:32:11,126
and die depending on how many

1122
00:32:11,126 --> 00:32:12,756
neighbors they have around them.

1123
00:32:13,346 --> 00:32:14,736
It's a pretty complicated idea,

1124
00:32:15,336 --> 00:32:16,576
that can be broken down into

1125
00:32:16,576 --> 00:32:17,296
simple rules.

1126
00:32:18,296 --> 00:32:19,816
We give the learner a fair

1127
00:32:19,816 --> 00:32:20,946
amount of text here, because

1128
00:32:20,946 --> 00:32:22,086
we're introducing something

1129
00:32:22,086 --> 00:32:22,626
totally new.

1130
00:32:22,626 --> 00:32:24,666
And, that's part of our job, is

1131
00:32:24,666 --> 00:32:26,696
to explain that in detail, for

1132
00:32:26,696 --> 00:32:27,636
those who are interested.

1133
00:32:29,026 --> 00:32:31,126
We do have a goal statement, but

1134
00:32:31,126 --> 00:32:33,556
it's embedded, and the goal is

1135
00:32:33,556 --> 00:32:35,186
just to really understand these

1136
00:32:35,186 --> 00:32:36,376
algorithms, to think.

1137
00:32:36,766 --> 00:32:38,416
There's no clear end point, no

1138
00:32:38,416 --> 00:32:40,886
time where the page tells you

1139
00:32:40,886 --> 00:32:41,876
you're ready to move on.

1140
00:32:42,296 --> 00:32:44,156
It's up to you, to understand

1141
00:32:44,156 --> 00:32:45,776
this, play around with the live

1142
00:32:45,776 --> 00:32:47,616
view, which you'll see in a

1143
00:32:48,516 --> 00:32:48,676
minute.

1144
00:32:48,826 --> 00:32:49,956
And, understand when you're

1145
00:32:49,956 --> 00:32:50,936
ready, as the learner.

1146
00:32:51,416 --> 00:32:54,796
We still offer this sort of

1147
00:32:55,116 --> 00:32:56,866
tl;dr version in the middle.

1148
00:32:57,026 --> 00:32:58,206
If you didn't want to read all

1149
00:32:58,206 --> 00:33:00,016
that prose at the top, here are

1150
00:32:58,206 --> 00:33:00,016
that prose at the top, here are

1151
00:33:00,016 --> 00:33:01,336
the rules of the simulation.

1152
00:33:01,566 --> 00:33:02,546
You can kind of get where you're

1153
00:33:02,546 --> 00:33:03,416
going with these.

1154
00:33:04,016 --> 00:33:05,026
So, it's somewhat similar

1155
00:33:05,026 --> 00:33:06,596
structure to completing a task,

1156
00:33:06,906 --> 00:33:08,426
but a totally different learner

1157
00:33:08,426 --> 00:33:10,066
goal, and author goal.

1158
00:33:10,616 --> 00:33:15,886
And then, finally, we have, kind

1159
00:33:15,886 --> 00:33:17,516
of instructions, at the bottom.

1160
00:33:17,926 --> 00:33:19,026
They're embedded, again.

1161
00:33:19,506 --> 00:33:21,346
Experiment with stepping through

1162
00:33:21,346 --> 00:33:22,706
the simulation, which we've

1163
00:33:22,746 --> 00:33:24,166
provided on the live view side.

1164
00:33:24,766 --> 00:33:26,706
Try it out, and then when you're

1165
00:33:26,706 --> 00:33:28,656
ready, go on to the next page to

1166
00:33:28,656 --> 00:33:29,796
explore what you'll be doing

1167
00:33:29,796 --> 00:33:31,716
with it.

1168
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:32,986
What's the audience of this

1169
00:33:32,986 --> 00:33:33,556
page?

1170
00:33:34,716 --> 00:33:35,656
Is it advanced?

1171
00:33:36,116 --> 00:33:39,266
Beginner? Are they science

1172
00:33:39,326 --> 00:33:39,796
students?

1173
00:33:40,206 --> 00:33:40,966
Are they artists?

1174
00:33:42,086 --> 00:33:42,866
The way you're going to figure

1175
00:33:42,866 --> 00:33:44,326
that out is, you have your

1176
00:33:44,326 --> 00:33:46,046
target audience in mind, and

1177
00:33:46,046 --> 00:33:47,536
then you need to do user

1178
00:33:47,536 --> 00:33:48,206
testing.

1179
00:33:48,646 --> 00:33:49,986
Find out if this is too

1180
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:51,116
complicated for them.

1181
00:33:51,576 --> 00:33:52,946
Figure out what words need to be

1182
00:33:52,946 --> 00:33:54,896
defined, what concepts need to

1183
00:33:54,896 --> 00:33:56,766
be explained more, or perhaps

1184
00:33:56,766 --> 00:33:56,916
less.

1185
00:33:57,666 --> 00:33:58,706
Don't underestimate your

1186
00:33:58,706 --> 00:33:58,976
audience either.

1187
00:34:05,796 --> 00:34:07,376
Is it coding time yet?

1188
00:34:08,456 --> 00:34:10,366
We've got all these ideas, we

1189
00:34:10,366 --> 00:34:12,376
understand the goal, the

1190
00:34:12,376 --> 00:34:13,106
audience.

1191
00:34:13,606 --> 00:34:14,476
We know all the parts of the

1192
00:34:14,476 --> 00:34:15,896
playground page, backward and

1193
00:34:15,896 --> 00:34:16,426
forward.

1194
00:34:16,906 --> 00:34:18,706
Surely, it must be coding time

1195
00:34:18,706 --> 00:34:19,116
now.

1196
00:34:19,706 --> 00:34:23,906
Not yet. I've moved from my

1197
00:34:23,906 --> 00:34:25,436
little notebook to my

1198
00:34:25,436 --> 00:34:27,146
whiteboard, but that's it.

1199
00:34:27,146 --> 00:34:29,596
I have expanded my ideas

1200
00:34:29,596 --> 00:34:29,976
somewhat.

1201
00:34:29,976 --> 00:34:33,606
I have some prose written down,

1202
00:34:33,606 --> 00:34:35,476
I have the coding section, I

1203
00:34:35,476 --> 00:34:36,795
have transitions.

1204
00:34:37,335 --> 00:34:39,255
Also, in this format, I can talk

1205
00:34:39,255 --> 00:34:40,806
to some of my co-workers in the

1206
00:34:40,806 --> 00:34:40,996
office.

1207
00:34:41,556 --> 00:34:43,045
Hey, Alex, does this make any

1208
00:34:43,045 --> 00:34:43,626
sense to you?

1209
00:34:43,626 --> 00:34:45,416
What do you think?

1210
00:34:45,646 --> 00:34:46,876
Is this a cool idea, Bill?

1211
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:49,626
Would your kids like this?

1212
00:34:49,835 --> 00:34:50,936
It's really important to get

1213
00:34:50,936 --> 00:34:53,016
feedback from your actual users,

1214
00:34:53,426 --> 00:34:54,596
and from your colleagues, your

1215
00:34:54,706 --> 00:34:55,116
peers.

1216
00:34:55,646 --> 00:34:57,085
This is your prototyping phase,

1217
00:34:57,085 --> 00:34:58,846
to figure out what works and

1218
00:34:58,846 --> 00:34:59,366
what doesn't.

1219
00:35:00,436 --> 00:35:01,886
So, no, it is not coding time

1220
00:35:01,886 --> 00:35:01,976
yet.

1221
00:35:06,796 --> 00:35:09,336
So, we've talked through goal

1222
00:35:09,336 --> 00:35:11,126
and audience, and it's time to

1223
00:35:11,126 --> 00:35:12,806
talk about passion.

1224
00:35:13,396 --> 00:35:15,296
Passion is so important.

1225
00:35:16,586 --> 00:35:17,556
This should be threaded

1226
00:35:17,556 --> 00:35:18,736
throughout all your other

1227
00:35:18,736 --> 00:35:20,136
playground prototyping and

1228
00:35:20,136 --> 00:35:20,696
thinking.

1229
00:35:21,486 --> 00:35:22,646
Why are you even doing this?

1230
00:35:22,646 --> 00:35:23,506
Why are you writing a

1231
00:35:23,506 --> 00:35:24,176
playground?

1232
00:35:24,766 --> 00:35:25,976
It's because you're passionate

1233
00:35:25,976 --> 00:35:27,076
about something that you want to

1234
00:35:27,076 --> 00:35:28,676
share, that you want to teach to

1235
00:35:28,676 --> 00:35:29,316
someone else.

1236
00:35:30,746 --> 00:35:31,946
If you're not passionate about

1237
00:35:31,946 --> 00:35:33,026
what you're writing a playground

1238
00:35:33,026 --> 00:35:34,396
about, why are you doing it?

1239
00:35:34,396 --> 00:35:37,966
And that, that not passion is

1240
00:35:37,966 --> 00:35:39,406
going to show through, and your

1241
00:35:39,406 --> 00:35:40,766
learner's not care either.

1242
00:35:41,426 --> 00:35:42,696
So, bringing your passion to

1243
00:35:42,696 --> 00:35:44,246
this is so important.

1244
00:35:44,746 --> 00:35:46,536
How can you do this?

1245
00:35:47,596 --> 00:35:49,436
Well, let's take a look at the

1246
00:35:49,436 --> 00:35:50,136
live view.

1247
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:53,156
I said this before, this is

1248
00:35:53,156 --> 00:35:54,656
where the learner is going to

1249
00:35:54,656 --> 00:35:56,586
get to experience their code

1250
00:35:56,586 --> 00:35:57,106
running.

1251
00:35:57,576 --> 00:35:58,686
This is where they're going to

1252
00:35:58,686 --> 00:36:00,196
get excited about creating,

1253
00:35:58,686 --> 00:36:00,196
get excited about creating,

1254
00:36:00,196 --> 00:36:01,436
about what they've made.

1255
00:36:02,026 --> 00:36:03,406
So, this is your chance to make

1256
00:36:03,406 --> 00:36:05,056
that experience as visually

1257
00:36:05,056 --> 00:36:07,026
exciting, as auditorily

1258
00:36:07,026 --> 00:36:09,676
exciting, as exciting period,

1259
00:36:10,006 --> 00:36:10,826
for your users.

1260
00:36:11,816 --> 00:36:13,106
Here's Learn to Code, where we

1261
00:36:13,106 --> 00:36:14,506
have this adorable character,

1262
00:36:14,696 --> 00:36:16,616
this cool, game-style world.

1263
00:36:17,166 --> 00:36:18,546
This appeals to a lot of people.

1264
00:36:19,456 --> 00:36:20,896
Gets them excited about jumping

1265
00:36:20,896 --> 00:36:21,866
into this world and writing

1266
00:36:21,866 --> 00:36:21,956
code.

1267
00:36:25,046 --> 00:36:26,356
Here's another example of

1268
00:36:26,356 --> 00:36:26,946
spirals.

1269
00:36:27,756 --> 00:36:29,966
I had so much fun working on

1270
00:36:30,026 --> 00:36:31,196
this, I would get totally

1271
00:36:31,196 --> 00:36:33,096
distracted trying to de-bug by

1272
00:36:33,096 --> 00:36:34,906
just creating cool new spirals

1273
00:36:34,906 --> 00:36:36,166
and modifying variables.

1274
00:36:36,796 --> 00:36:37,976
That's a great sign.

1275
00:36:38,006 --> 00:36:40,216
If you enjoy going through the

1276
00:36:40,216 --> 00:36:42,426
tasks in your playground book,

1277
00:36:42,426 --> 00:36:44,956
your learners probably will too.

1278
00:36:44,956 --> 00:36:46,076
And, on the other hand, if

1279
00:36:46,076 --> 00:36:47,716
you're bored by the exercises,

1280
00:36:48,016 --> 00:36:48,986
if you wonder why you're

1281
00:36:48,986 --> 00:36:51,106
teaching this, how are you going

1282
00:36:51,106 --> 00:36:52,316
to get your learner motivated to

1283
00:36:52,316 --> 00:36:53,106
go through them either?

1284
00:36:53,706 --> 00:36:55,156
You have to be excited about

1285
00:36:55,156 --> 00:36:56,696
what you're doing, to bring your

1286
00:36:56,696 --> 00:36:58,016
passion to those views.

1287
00:36:58,386 --> 00:37:00,786
Here's another cool example,

1288
00:36:58,386 --> 00:37:00,786
Here's another cool example,

1289
00:37:00,886 --> 00:37:01,976
totally different style.

1290
00:37:02,536 --> 00:37:03,676
This is, Blink.

1291
00:37:04,196 --> 00:37:05,666
From that page of text you saw

1292
00:37:05,666 --> 00:37:06,166
earlier.

1293
00:37:06,916 --> 00:37:08,076
We have all that text, but we

1294
00:37:08,076 --> 00:37:09,206
also have this rich,

1295
00:37:09,396 --> 00:37:11,356
interactive, live view on the

1296
00:37:11,356 --> 00:37:12,856
right hand side, where the

1297
00:37:12,856 --> 00:37:13,686
learner can play with the

1298
00:37:13,686 --> 00:37:15,136
algorithm, they can use touch

1299
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:18,146
gestures to interact with it.

1300
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:19,866
This is the place where passion

1301
00:37:20,386 --> 00:37:20,976
can really shine.

1302
00:37:26,936 --> 00:37:30,856
So. We have the marriage of

1303
00:37:30,996 --> 00:37:32,746
teaching that Bill talked to you

1304
00:37:32,746 --> 00:37:35,356
about, and designing that I

1305
00:37:35,356 --> 00:37:36,176
talked to you about.

1306
00:37:37,026 --> 00:37:39,186
It's so important to keep these

1307
00:37:39,186 --> 00:37:40,706
in mind, the teaching aspect,

1308
00:37:40,706 --> 00:37:41,536
what you're trying to get

1309
00:37:41,536 --> 00:37:44,186
across, and how you're designing

1310
00:37:44,186 --> 00:37:44,326
it.

1311
00:37:44,586 --> 00:37:45,766
How you're prototyping it.

1312
00:37:46,016 --> 00:37:47,336
Who you're talking to for help,

1313
00:37:47,576 --> 00:37:49,286
how often you're user testing.

1314
00:37:49,746 --> 00:37:53,026
With these two-- when these

1315
00:37:53,026 --> 00:37:55,346
powers combine, we are Captain

1316
00:37:55,346 --> 00:37:56,266
Amazing Teacher.

1317
00:37:56,916 --> 00:38:03,526
So. Get ready for it.

1318
00:37:56,916 --> 00:38:03,526
So. Get ready for it.

1319
00:38:03,796 --> 00:38:04,836
Coding time.

1320
00:38:05,516 --> 00:38:11,466
[ Applause ]

1321
00:38:11,966 --> 00:38:13,896
Once you have your prototype, or

1322
00:38:13,896 --> 00:38:15,546
excuse me, storyboard figured

1323
00:38:15,546 --> 00:38:15,876
out.

1324
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:17,756
Once you've solicited feedback,

1325
00:38:17,916 --> 00:38:19,846
talked to your users, talked to

1326
00:38:19,846 --> 00:38:21,016
whoever wanted you to make this

1327
00:38:21,066 --> 00:38:22,176
playground in the first place,

1328
00:38:22,176 --> 00:38:23,096
if it wasn't you.

1329
00:38:23,416 --> 00:38:24,536
You've gotten all those things

1330
00:38:24,536 --> 00:38:25,996
together, you know what you want

1331
00:38:25,996 --> 00:38:27,566
your hints to be, you know what

1332
00:38:27,566 --> 00:38:28,776
you want your success messages

1333
00:38:28,776 --> 00:38:29,796
to be, how you're going to

1334
00:38:29,796 --> 00:38:30,996
assist your learner in all the

1335
00:38:30,996 --> 00:38:31,816
best ways.

1336
00:38:31,816 --> 00:38:33,946
You've got a storyboard, now it

1337
00:38:33,946 --> 00:38:35,306
is time for you to write code,

1338
00:38:35,306 --> 00:38:36,936
and make that awesome playground

1339
00:38:36,936 --> 00:38:38,316
idea a reality.

1340
00:38:38,986 --> 00:38:40,196
And, you don't need me to teach

1341
00:38:40,196 --> 00:38:43,116
you how to code.

1342
00:38:43,376 --> 00:38:45,906
So, you can probably all say it

1343
00:38:45,906 --> 00:38:47,876
with me now at this point, but

1344
00:38:47,876 --> 00:38:49,606
the three things to take away

1345
00:38:49,606 --> 00:38:53,276
from this presentation are goal,

1346
00:38:54,916 --> 00:38:59,546
audience, and passion.

1347
00:39:00,026 --> 00:39:00,766
That's right.

1348
00:39:01,746 --> 00:39:03,286
And so, with those things in

1349
00:39:03,286 --> 00:39:05,506
mind, I say to you all, go

1350
00:39:05,506 --> 00:39:06,976
forth, and teach.

1356
00:39:26,476 --> 00:39:28,426

1357
00:39:28,426 --> 00:39:29,766
awesome related sessions this

1358
00:39:29,766 --> 00:39:32,136
year, which have all passed, but

1359
00:39:32,136 --> 00:39:33,286

1360
00:39:33,786 --> 00:39:36,346

1364
00:39:39,716 --> 00:39:41,466
