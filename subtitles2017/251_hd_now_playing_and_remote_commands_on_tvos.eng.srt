00:00:18,046 --> 00:00:18,696
&gt;&gt; Welcome to Now Playing and

2
00:00:18,696 --> 00:00:20,166
Remote Commands on tvOS.

3
00:00:20,656 --> 00:00:21,966
I'm Justin Voss, an engineer on

4
00:00:21,966 --> 00:00:23,726
tvOS and in this talk we'll

5
00:00:23,726 --> 00:00:25,046
cover how you can provide great

6
00:00:25,046 --> 00:00:26,046
metadata and playback

7
00:00:26,046 --> 00:00:27,176
experiences for your viewers.

8
00:00:27,676 --> 00:00:29,786
First, let's talk about

9
00:00:29,786 --> 00:00:30,816
providing Now Playing

10
00:00:30,816 --> 00:00:31,266
information.

11
00:00:31,946 --> 00:00:33,156
Having accurate and complete

12
00:00:33,156 --> 00:00:34,496
metadata about your content will

13
00:00:34,496 --> 00:00:35,746
help viewers to understand what

14
00:00:35,746 --> 00:00:36,766
they're watching across a

15
00:00:36,766 --> 00:00:38,626
variety of interfaces across

16
00:00:38,626 --> 00:00:40,256
tvOS and iOS.

17
00:00:40,816 --> 00:00:43,296
The metadata you provide is

18
00:00:43,296 --> 00:00:44,436
displayed in several places.

19
00:00:45,126 --> 00:00:46,926
For video content, the built-in

20
00:00:46,926 --> 00:00:48,336
AVPlayerViewController displays

21
00:00:48,336 --> 00:00:49,526
metadata along the top of the

22
00:00:49,526 --> 00:00:50,126
video screen.

23
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:52,706
For both video and audio content

24
00:00:52,706 --> 00:00:54,586
the TV Remote app for iOS would

25
00:00:54,586 --> 00:00:56,056
both display metadata and

26
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:56,846
playback controls.

27
00:00:57,316 --> 00:00:58,806
And for audio content, your

28
00:00:58,806 --> 00:01:00,116
metadata will be displayed in a

29
00:00:58,806 --> 00:01:00,116
metadata will be displayed in a

30
00:01:00,116 --> 00:01:01,026
badge in the corner of the

31
00:01:01,026 --> 00:01:02,646
screen and as a full-screen

32
00:01:02,646 --> 00:01:03,756
display when the user is idle.

33
00:01:04,706 --> 00:01:06,036
Let's look at some screenshots

34
00:01:06,036 --> 00:01:06,996
of these to better understand

35
00:01:07,346 --> 00:01:07,436
them.

36
00:01:07,436 --> 00:01:08,266
In this screenshot, you can

37
00:01:08,266 --> 00:01:09,546
already tell that we're watching

38
00:01:09,586 --> 00:01:11,706
a WWDC talk from last year

39
00:01:12,166 --> 00:01:13,476
because the metadata onscreen

40
00:01:13,476 --> 00:01:14,356
makes that super clear.

41
00:01:14,996 --> 00:01:16,216
This is an example of using the

42
00:01:16,216 --> 00:01:18,016
built-in AVPlayerViewController

43
00:01:18,016 --> 00:01:18,766
for video content.

44
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:21,466
Here you can see the same talk,

45
00:01:21,606 --> 00:01:23,006
but displayed in the TV Remote

46
00:01:23,006 --> 00:01:23,846
app for iOS.

47
00:01:24,146 --> 00:01:25,306
You can also see the playback

48
00:01:25,306 --> 00:01:26,896
controls which we'll cover later

49
00:01:26,896 --> 00:01:27,326
in the talk.

50
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:29,096
For audio content, when the Now

51
00:01:29,096 --> 00:01:30,366
Playing information changes the

52
00:01:30,366 --> 00:01:31,696
listener will see a notification

53
00:01:31,696 --> 00:01:32,826
on their screen with the updated

54
00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:33,286
metadata.

55
00:01:34,006 --> 00:01:35,266
In this screenshot here, you can

56
00:01:35,266 --> 00:01:36,516
see what this would look like if

57
00:01:36,516 --> 00:01:37,656
we were listening to an audio

58
00:01:37,656 --> 00:01:39,436
only version of that WWDC talk.

59
00:01:40,356 --> 00:01:41,436
Finally, if the user puts down

60
00:01:41,436 --> 00:01:43,136
the remote for a while tvOS will

61
00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:44,306
automatically display the Now

62
00:01:44,306 --> 00:01:45,246
Playing metadata in a

63
00:01:45,246 --> 00:01:46,366
full-screen view like you see

64
00:01:46,366 --> 00:01:47,526
here which really shows off the

65
00:01:47,526 --> 00:01:47,896
artwork.

66
00:01:49,176 --> 00:01:50,496
So, hopefully I've convinced you

67
00:01:50,496 --> 00:01:51,626
that providing the complete set

68
00:01:51,626 --> 00:01:52,736
of Now Playing information is

69
00:01:52,736 --> 00:01:53,216
worth your time.

70
00:01:54,186 --> 00:01:55,016
Let's talk about some of the

71
00:01:55,016 --> 00:01:55,936
different ways you can do that.

72
00:01:56,576 --> 00:01:57,806
You have a few choices so it

73
00:01:57,806 --> 00:01:58,486
depends on what kind of

74
00:01:58,486 --> 00:01:59,646
technology you're using in your

75
00:02:00,296 --> 00:02:00,366
app.

76
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:03,576
Those of you using TVML can add

77
00:02:03,576 --> 00:02:05,296
metadata using the MediaItem

78
00:02:05,296 --> 00:02:06,086
JavaScript object.

79
00:02:06,946 --> 00:02:07,806
This object has several

80
00:02:07,806 --> 00:02:08,985
properties on it for Now Playing

81
00:02:08,985 --> 00:02:10,626
info, including a title,

82
00:02:10,735 --> 00:02:12,836
subtitle and description, you

83
00:02:12,836 --> 00:02:14,246
can provide a URL to an artwork

84
00:02:14,246 --> 00:02:16,126
image and you can even provide

85
00:02:16,126 --> 00:02:17,226
information about the content

86
00:02:17,226 --> 00:02:20,056
rating such as PG-13 or R and

87
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:21,316
whether the content is explicit.

88
00:02:21,586 --> 00:02:24,196
In the code sample, here you can

89
00:02:24,196 --> 00:02:25,056
see that I'm creating a

90
00:02:25,056 --> 00:02:27,026
MediaItem object with a URL to a

91
00:02:27,026 --> 00:02:28,936
video and then configuring a

92
00:02:28,936 --> 00:02:30,726
title and description on it and

93
00:02:30,726 --> 00:02:31,976
providing a URL to an artwork

94
00:02:31,976 --> 00:02:32,246
image.

95
00:02:32,766 --> 00:02:34,056
If you're using AVKit to play

96
00:02:34,056 --> 00:02:36,146
your content you'll want to use

97
00:02:36,146 --> 00:02:37,696
the AV metadata item class to

98
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:38,686
provide Now Playing info.

99
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:41,376
For each piece of metadata you

100
00:02:41,376 --> 00:02:42,876
want to provide, such as a title

101
00:02:42,876 --> 00:02:44,706
or artwork, etcetera you'll

102
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,656
create an AV mutable metadata

103
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,926
item and configure several

104
00:02:47,926 --> 00:02:48,676
properties on it.

105
00:02:48,976 --> 00:02:50,366
You provide an identifier which

106
00:02:50,366 --> 00:02:51,586
tells AVKit what kind of

107
00:02:51,586 --> 00:02:52,646
metadata this represents.

108
00:02:53,036 --> 00:02:54,116
This is how we know to tell the

109
00:02:54,116 --> 00:02:55,416
difference between the object

110
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:56,556
that represents a title versus

111
00:02:56,556 --> 00:02:57,556
the description and so on.

112
00:02:58,106 --> 00:02:59,126
You provide the value of the

113
00:02:59,126 --> 00:03:00,806
metadata itself, which may be a

114
00:02:59,126 --> 00:03:00,806
metadata itself, which may be a

115
00:03:00,806 --> 00:03:02,306
string or raw data bytes.

116
00:03:02,886 --> 00:03:03,406
You should set the

117
00:03:03,406 --> 00:03:04,986
extendedLanguageTag to specify

118
00:03:04,986 --> 00:03:06,176
what language the metadata is

119
00:03:06,176 --> 00:03:06,756
intended for.

120
00:03:07,456 --> 00:03:08,506
Unless you have a good reason to

121
00:03:08,506 --> 00:03:09,766
do otherwise we strongly

122
00:03:09,766 --> 00:03:12,126
recommend that you use the value

123
00:03:12,376 --> 00:03:13,416
und which means undefined.

124
00:03:14,356 --> 00:03:15,676
The way this property works is

125
00:03:15,676 --> 00:03:17,286
that it will only be visible to

126
00:03:17,286 --> 00:03:18,856
the user if the user's locale

127
00:03:18,936 --> 00:03:20,406
matches the metadata's locale.

128
00:03:20,906 --> 00:03:22,286
So, for example, if you had a

129
00:03:22,286 --> 00:03:23,246
movie that was produced in the

130
00:03:23,246 --> 00:03:25,246
USA you may be tempted to

131
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:26,856
provide the title of that movie

132
00:03:26,886 --> 00:03:28,356
with the language tag of English

133
00:03:28,356 --> 00:03:29,576
since the title is in English.

134
00:03:30,256 --> 00:03:31,246
But if you did that then a

135
00:03:31,246 --> 00:03:32,706
viewer in Germany wouldn't see

136
00:03:32,706 --> 00:03:34,186
any title at all because the

137
00:03:34,186 --> 00:03:35,586
metadata language doesn't match

138
00:03:35,586 --> 00:03:36,326
their language.

139
00:03:36,826 --> 00:03:38,686
But if you had used the tag und

140
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:39,676
then everyone will see the

141
00:03:39,676 --> 00:03:40,836
metadata regardless of their

142
00:03:40,836 --> 00:03:41,536
language settings.

143
00:03:42,966 --> 00:03:44,646
Finally, in some cases you need

144
00:03:44,646 --> 00:03:46,086
to give us a hint about how to

145
00:03:46,086 --> 00:03:47,036
interpret the value you've

146
00:03:47,036 --> 00:03:47,486
provided.

147
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:49,486
In the case of providing artwork

148
00:03:49,486 --> 00:03:50,796
image you'll give us the raw

149
00:03:50,796 --> 00:03:52,176
bytes of the image as the value

150
00:03:52,436 --> 00:03:53,466
and then use the dataType to

151
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:55,176
tell us if the image is a JPEG

152
00:03:55,176 --> 00:03:55,686
or a PNG.

153
00:03:56,506 --> 00:03:58,216
Let's look at some code samples

154
00:03:58,216 --> 00:03:59,216
to get a feel for how this

155
00:03:59,216 --> 00:03:59,576
works.

156
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:03,406
Here you can see the code where

157
00:04:03,406 --> 00:04:05,076
I'm creating an AV playerItem

158
00:04:05,076 --> 00:04:06,306
and giving it a title and

159
00:04:06,306 --> 00:04:06,706
description.

160
00:04:07,616 --> 00:04:08,776
In the first large code block

161
00:04:08,976 --> 00:04:10,096
I'm creating an

162
00:04:10,096 --> 00:04:11,366
AVMutableMetadataItem to

163
00:04:11,366 --> 00:04:13,556
represent the title.

164
00:04:13,716 --> 00:04:15,146
The first thing that I do is I

165
00:04:15,146 --> 00:04:16,435
set the identifier to

166
00:04:16,435 --> 00:04:17,846
AVMetadataCommon

167
00:04:17,846 --> 00:04:19,786
IdentifierTitle so that AVKit

168
00:04:19,786 --> 00:04:21,305
knows that this metadata item is

169
00:04:21,305 --> 00:04:21,625
the title.

170
00:04:21,676 --> 00:04:25,526
Then I set the actual value as a

171
00:04:25,526 --> 00:04:25,826
string.

172
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,176
The AV metadata item API

173
00:04:28,466 --> 00:04:29,716
requires these values to be NS

174
00:04:29,716 --> 00:04:31,216
object types so casting the

175
00:04:31,216 --> 00:04:31,716
[inaudible] string to an

176
00:04:31,716 --> 00:04:31,926
NSString.

177
00:04:36,056 --> 00:04:36,906
Finally, I'm setting the

178
00:04:36,906 --> 00:04:38,686
extendedLanguageTag to und

179
00:04:38,686 --> 00:04:39,756
because the title of this talk

180
00:04:39,756 --> 00:04:40,696
should appear the same

181
00:04:40,696 --> 00:04:41,176
worldwide.

182
00:04:41,676 --> 00:04:44,066
In the second large code block,

183
00:04:44,066 --> 00:04:44,956
I'm doing most of the same

184
00:04:44,956 --> 00:04:45,826
things to assign the

185
00:04:45,826 --> 00:04:46,336
description.

186
00:04:47,006 --> 00:04:48,096
Other than providing a different

187
00:04:48,096 --> 00:04:50,136
value you can see that on this

188
00:04:50,136 --> 00:04:51,936
line I'm setting the identifier

189
00:04:51,936 --> 00:04:53,696
to AVMetadataCommon

190
00:04:53,696 --> 00:04:55,716
IdentifierDescription so that

191
00:04:55,716 --> 00:04:56,896
AVKit knows how to interpret

192
00:04:56,896 --> 00:04:57,256
this item.

193
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:00,076
Finally, on the last line I

194
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:00,076
Finally, on the last line I

195
00:05:00,076 --> 00:05:01,206
assign an array of these

196
00:05:01,206 --> 00:05:02,866
metadata items to the AV

197
00:05:02,866 --> 00:05:04,666
playerItem's external metadata

198
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:05,026
property.

199
00:05:05,616 --> 00:05:08,706
If you wanted to provide the

200
00:05:08,706 --> 00:05:09,896
release date of your content as

201
00:05:09,896 --> 00:05:11,486
a metadata item you can do that

202
00:05:11,486 --> 00:05:12,776
if you format your release date

203
00:05:12,776 --> 00:05:14,036
as a string in a specific

204
00:05:14,036 --> 00:05:14,396
format.

205
00:05:15,066 --> 00:05:16,236
This code sample shows you how

206
00:05:16,236 --> 00:05:16,746
you can do that.

207
00:05:17,306 --> 00:05:19,036
Here you see that I'm creating

208
00:05:19,036 --> 00:05:21,036
the date object for an arbitrary

209
00:05:21,036 --> 00:05:21,126
date.

210
00:05:21,886 --> 00:05:23,336
Then I create a date formatter

211
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:24,886
and provide a specific date

212
00:05:24,886 --> 00:05:26,666
format string here on this line.

213
00:05:27,266 --> 00:05:29,906
To create the metadata item, I

214
00:05:29,906 --> 00:05:31,006
use the identifier

215
00:05:31,236 --> 00:05:32,546
AVMetadataCommon

216
00:05:32,546 --> 00:05:35,016
IdentifierCreationDate and

217
00:05:35,016 --> 00:05:36,046
finally, I use the date

218
00:05:36,046 --> 00:05:37,436
formatter to convert the date

219
00:05:37,436 --> 00:05:38,966
object into a formatted string

220
00:05:39,116 --> 00:05:40,366
and cast that string as an

221
00:05:40,366 --> 00:05:40,656
NSString.

222
00:05:41,876 --> 00:05:43,336
Now in AVPlayerViewController

223
00:05:43,636 --> 00:05:44,706
viewers will be able to see the

224
00:05:44,706 --> 00:05:45,786
release year of the video

225
00:05:45,786 --> 00:05:47,426
alongside the other Now Playing

226
00:05:47,966 --> 00:05:48,116
info.

227
00:05:49,796 --> 00:05:51,336
Finally, here's an example of

228
00:05:51,336 --> 00:05:52,666
how to provide image metadata

229
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:53,316
for your content.

230
00:05:54,256 --> 00:05:55,416
Here you can see that the first

231
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:56,946
thing I need to do is to get my

232
00:05:56,946 --> 00:05:58,256
image as a data object.

233
00:05:58,806 --> 00:05:59,866
I'm doing that by loading the

234
00:05:59,866 --> 00:06:01,226
image from a JPEG that's in my

235
00:05:59,866 --> 00:06:01,226
image from a JPEG that's in my

236
00:06:01,226 --> 00:06:02,306
app bundle, but you could get

237
00:06:02,306 --> 00:06:03,526
your artwork from any source.

238
00:06:03,976 --> 00:06:06,496
Then to create the metadata item

239
00:06:06,676 --> 00:06:07,386
the first thing I need to

240
00:06:07,386 --> 00:06:09,416
specify is my identifier, which

241
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:10,406
in this case should be

242
00:06:10,656 --> 00:06:12,056
AVMetadataCommon

243
00:06:12,056 --> 00:06:13,236
IdentifierArtwork.

244
00:06:14,346 --> 00:06:15,696
Next, I provide the artwork data

245
00:06:15,696 --> 00:06:17,786
itself and cast the Swift data

246
00:06:17,786 --> 00:06:19,816
object to an NSData.

247
00:06:20,876 --> 00:06:22,156
Finally, to indicate what kind

248
00:06:22,156 --> 00:06:23,786
of image this is I need to set

249
00:06:23,786 --> 00:06:24,636
the dataType property.

250
00:06:25,186 --> 00:06:26,116
Since I know this image is a

251
00:06:26,116 --> 00:06:27,736
JPEG I'm going to provide this

252
00:06:27,736 --> 00:06:29,006
constant value here to indicate

253
00:06:29,006 --> 00:06:29,216
that.

254
00:06:29,716 --> 00:06:32,876
Okay to give you a visual

255
00:06:32,876 --> 00:06:33,986
reference of where some of these

256
00:06:33,986 --> 00:06:35,626
items appear onscreen here's a

257
00:06:35,626 --> 00:06:36,416
screenshot of the

258
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:37,906
AVPlayerViewController with some

259
00:06:37,906 --> 00:06:38,856
annotations on it.

260
00:06:39,556 --> 00:06:40,706
The color coding will show where

261
00:06:40,706 --> 00:06:42,016
each metadata identifier is

262
00:06:42,016 --> 00:06:42,416
displayed.

263
00:06:43,196 --> 00:06:44,556
So, this is where the artwork

264
00:06:44,556 --> 00:06:47,326
will be displayed, the title,

265
00:06:47,896 --> 00:06:51,946
the creation date, and the

266
00:06:52,196 --> 00:06:52,746
description.

267
00:06:53,286 --> 00:06:56,296
And here's a similar screenshot

268
00:06:56,296 --> 00:06:57,226
of the TV Remote app.

269
00:06:57,946 --> 00:06:59,016
You can see here the Remote app

270
00:06:59,016 --> 00:07:00,516
doesn't display exactly the same

271
00:06:59,016 --> 00:07:00,516
doesn't display exactly the same

272
00:07:00,516 --> 00:07:01,786
set of metadata as

273
00:07:01,786 --> 00:07:02,666
AVPlayerViewController.

274
00:07:02,956 --> 00:07:05,376
It displays the same artwork and

275
00:07:05,866 --> 00:07:08,346
title, but instead of displaying

276
00:07:08,346 --> 00:07:09,596
the description it instead

277
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:12,336
displays the artist and the

278
00:07:12,336 --> 00:07:12,836
album name.

279
00:07:14,196 --> 00:07:15,006
You can see the AV foundation

280
00:07:15,006 --> 00:07:15,966
identifiers to use here.

281
00:07:20,046 --> 00:07:20,966
Okay that's all for AVKit.

282
00:07:21,296 --> 00:07:22,266
If you're just playing your

283
00:07:22,266 --> 00:07:23,396
video using some other

284
00:07:23,396 --> 00:07:25,446
technology like Video Toolbox or

285
00:07:25,446 --> 00:07:26,426
if you're playing audio only

286
00:07:26,426 --> 00:07:28,066
content then you'll need another

287
00:07:28,066 --> 00:07:29,446
way to provide Now Playing info.

288
00:07:30,236 --> 00:07:32,276
In those cases, you can use the

289
00:07:32,276 --> 00:07:33,996
MPNowPlayingInfoCenter.

290
00:07:35,006 --> 00:07:36,286
This is a singleton object that

291
00:07:36,286 --> 00:07:37,466
has a dictionary property that

292
00:07:37,466 --> 00:07:38,476
you can write your metadata

293
00:07:38,476 --> 00:07:38,796
into.

294
00:07:39,536 --> 00:07:40,766
So, there's a key for title, for

295
00:07:40,766 --> 00:07:42,146
album name, for artwork and so

296
00:07:42,146 --> 00:07:42,276
on.

297
00:07:42,716 --> 00:07:44,876
In addition to the metadata that

298
00:07:44,876 --> 00:07:46,506
you are probably expecting you

299
00:07:46,506 --> 00:07:48,216
can also specify explicitly if

300
00:07:48,216 --> 00:07:49,586
the content is audio or video.

301
00:07:50,406 --> 00:07:51,396
You can also provide some

302
00:07:51,396 --> 00:07:52,616
information about the content

303
00:07:52,616 --> 00:07:54,186
duration and the user's current

304
00:07:54,186 --> 00:07:54,856
playback position.

305
00:07:55,426 --> 00:07:57,986
Your artwork is not provided as

306
00:07:57,986 --> 00:07:59,406
raw bytes, but as an

307
00:07:59,476 --> 00:08:01,306
MPMediaItemArtwork object which

308
00:07:59,476 --> 00:08:01,306
MPMediaItemArtwork object which

309
00:08:01,306 --> 00:08:02,626
we'll talk about more in just a

310
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:03,246
minute.

311
00:08:04,566 --> 00:08:05,236
Finally, it's your

312
00:08:05,236 --> 00:08:06,606
responsibility to update this

313
00:08:06,606 --> 00:08:07,776
metadata dictionary as the

314
00:08:07,776 --> 00:08:08,936
playback state changes.

315
00:08:09,686 --> 00:08:10,706
You do not need to update it

316
00:08:10,706 --> 00:08:11,976
every second or even every

317
00:08:11,976 --> 00:08:13,266
minute, but you should update it

318
00:08:13,266 --> 00:08:14,256
when certain events occur.

319
00:08:14,956 --> 00:08:16,016
We recommend that you update it

320
00:08:16,016 --> 00:08:17,566
when the currently playing item

321
00:08:17,566 --> 00:08:19,996
changes, if any metadata about

322
00:08:19,996 --> 00:08:20,936
the currently playing item

323
00:08:20,936 --> 00:08:22,226
changes, such as the title or

324
00:08:22,226 --> 00:08:24,796
artist name, if the user seeks

325
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:26,016
to a new position of the content

326
00:08:26,016 --> 00:08:27,276
or if the playback rate changes

327
00:08:27,906 --> 00:08:29,326
and finally, if playback begins

328
00:08:29,326 --> 00:08:29,876
or stops.

329
00:08:30,386 --> 00:08:32,385
Let's take a look at some code.

330
00:08:33,696 --> 00:08:34,785
Here in the first code block,

331
00:08:35,296 --> 00:08:36,265
I'm creating the object that's

332
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:37,556
going to represent my artwork.

333
00:08:38,525 --> 00:08:40,546
The way this MPMediaItemArtwork

334
00:08:40,546 --> 00:08:42,096
class works is that you provide

335
00:08:42,096 --> 00:08:43,176
us with the native size of the

336
00:08:43,176 --> 00:08:45,266
image in a block that we'll call

337
00:08:45,266 --> 00:08:46,766
later with specific image sizes.

338
00:08:47,106 --> 00:08:49,676
The way this MPMediaItemArtwork

339
00:08:49,676 --> 00:08:51,316
class works is that you provide

340
00:08:51,316 --> 00:08:52,626
us with a native size of the

341
00:08:52,626 --> 00:08:54,366
image in a block that we'll call

342
00:08:54,366 --> 00:08:55,956
later with specific image sizes.

343
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:57,816
This block should return a

344
00:08:57,816 --> 00:08:59,806
UIImage object that closely fits

345
00:08:59,806 --> 00:09:01,096
inside the size that's passed to

346
00:08:59,806 --> 00:09:01,096
inside the size that's passed to

347
00:09:01,096 --> 00:09:01,476
the block.

348
00:09:02,116 --> 00:09:03,436
So, for example, your app may

349
00:09:03,436 --> 00:09:04,356
have downloaded several

350
00:09:04,356 --> 00:09:05,486
different sizes of the same

351
00:09:05,486 --> 00:09:07,816
artwork say in small, medium and

352
00:09:07,816 --> 00:09:08,706
large sizes.

353
00:09:09,286 --> 00:09:10,406
When we call this block, you

354
00:09:10,406 --> 00:09:11,646
should take the size we provide

355
00:09:11,946 --> 00:09:13,206
and return the image that most

356
00:09:13,206 --> 00:09:14,646
closely fits the requested size.

357
00:09:15,996 --> 00:09:17,016
We would discourage you from

358
00:09:17,016 --> 00:09:18,276
trying to perform expensive

359
00:09:18,276 --> 00:09:19,796
image resizing operations here,

360
00:09:19,886 --> 00:09:20,976
just return the image that you

361
00:09:20,976 --> 00:09:22,246
already have.

362
00:09:23,556 --> 00:09:24,686
In the second block of code,

363
00:09:24,686 --> 00:09:25,646
this is where I'm actually

364
00:09:25,646 --> 00:09:26,966
providing all of my metadata to

365
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:28,486
MPNowPlayingInfoCenter.

366
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:30,366
You can see that this is just a

367
00:09:30,366 --> 00:09:31,676
plain Swift dictionary with some

368
00:09:31,676 --> 00:09:32,706
keys that are provided by the

369
00:09:32,706 --> 00:09:33,806
framework and I'm simply

370
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:35,136
providing my values as regular

371
00:09:35,136 --> 00:09:35,816
Swift types.

372
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:37,746
There are two properties that I

373
00:09:37,746 --> 00:09:38,976
want to call out in particular

374
00:09:38,976 --> 00:09:39,156
though.

375
00:09:39,856 --> 00:09:41,176
The ElapsedPlaybackTime and the

376
00:09:41,176 --> 00:09:41,986
PlaybackDuration.

377
00:09:42,806 --> 00:09:43,866
Like I mentioned earlier, you

378
00:09:43,866 --> 00:09:44,866
should provide these keys so

379
00:09:44,866 --> 00:09:46,216
that tvOS knows how long your

380
00:09:46,216 --> 00:09:47,926
content is and where the user is

381
00:09:47,926 --> 00:09:49,276
currently at within the content.

382
00:09:49,996 --> 00:09:51,366
As various playback events occur

383
00:09:51,366 --> 00:09:52,066
you should update the

384
00:09:52,066 --> 00:09:53,496
ElapsedPlaybackTime to match

385
00:09:53,496 --> 00:09:54,736
where the user currently is.

386
00:09:55,606 --> 00:09:55,996
There's no

387
00:09:55,996 --> 00:09:57,536
AVPlayerViewController for this

388
00:09:57,536 --> 00:09:59,486
API on tvOS, but I can show you

389
00:09:59,486 --> 00:10:01,066
what this metadata looks like in

390
00:09:59,486 --> 00:10:01,066
what this metadata looks like in

391
00:10:01,066 --> 00:10:01,976
the TV Remote app.

392
00:10:02,726 --> 00:10:03,816
You can see where each property

393
00:10:03,816 --> 00:10:04,706
is displayed onscreen.

394
00:10:05,206 --> 00:10:05,866
These should look pretty

395
00:10:05,866 --> 00:10:07,226
familiar compared to the AVKit

396
00:10:07,226 --> 00:10:07,506
version.

397
00:10:08,776 --> 00:10:10,066
Take note that in this version

398
00:10:10,066 --> 00:10:11,226
though the scrubber bar is under

399
00:10:11,226 --> 00:10:11,746
your control.

400
00:10:12,546 --> 00:10:14,406
The ElapsedPlaybackTime and the

401
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:16,566
duration need to be provided by

402
00:10:16,566 --> 00:10:17,466
your app to be displayed

403
00:10:17,466 --> 00:10:17,976
correctly here.

404
00:10:22,046 --> 00:10:22,826
All right, let's change gears a

405
00:10:22,826 --> 00:10:24,296
bit now and talk about how your

406
00:10:24,296 --> 00:10:25,866
app can handle external playback

407
00:10:25,866 --> 00:10:26,366
commands.

408
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:27,836
Of course, your app will have

409
00:10:27,836 --> 00:10:28,996
its own controls that the user

410
00:10:28,996 --> 00:10:30,216
can interact with when your app

411
00:10:30,216 --> 00:10:31,786
is displayed, but the user may

412
00:10:31,786 --> 00:10:33,106
also want to control your app

413
00:10:33,106 --> 00:10:35,696
from the TV Remote app on iOS or

414
00:10:35,696 --> 00:10:36,326
if they're listening to

415
00:10:36,326 --> 00:10:37,686
background audio from your app

416
00:10:37,686 --> 00:10:39,726
on tvOS pressing the play pause

417
00:10:39,726 --> 00:10:41,286
button on the Siri remote can

418
00:10:41,286 --> 00:10:42,616
pause your app even while it's

419
00:10:42,616 --> 00:10:43,176
in the background.

420
00:10:43,866 --> 00:10:44,746
To support these kinds of

421
00:10:44,746 --> 00:10:46,186
interactions you will need to

422
00:10:46,186 --> 00:10:47,356
make sure your app can handle

423
00:10:47,356 --> 00:10:47,936
these Remote Commands.

424
00:10:50,046 --> 00:10:50,776
The way to do that is with an

425
00:10:50,776 --> 00:10:51,566
API called

426
00:10:51,566 --> 00:10:52,706
MPRemoteCommandCenter.

427
00:10:53,576 --> 00:10:54,566
The way to do that is with an

428
00:10:54,566 --> 00:10:55,546
API called

429
00:10:55,606 --> 00:10:56,646
MPRemoteCommandCenter.

430
00:10:57,286 --> 00:10:58,616
This is another singleton object

431
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:00,006
that has a property for each

432
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:00,006
that has a property for each

433
00:11:00,006 --> 00:11:01,076
different kind of command that

434
00:11:01,076 --> 00:11:02,316
your app can choose to support.

435
00:11:02,806 --> 00:11:04,866
For each command that you want

436
00:11:04,866 --> 00:11:06,776
support you can register either

437
00:11:06,776 --> 00:11:07,976
a target-action pair or a

438
00:11:07,976 --> 00:11:09,396
callback block which will be

439
00:11:09,396 --> 00:11:10,376
invoked when the command is

440
00:11:10,376 --> 00:11:10,736
performed.

441
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:13,246
If you provide a target-action

442
00:11:13,246 --> 00:11:14,386
or a block the command is

443
00:11:14,386 --> 00:11:15,396
assumed to be supported.

444
00:11:16,146 --> 00:11:17,236
If you want to provide a handler

445
00:11:17,236 --> 00:11:18,176
for the command, but need to

446
00:11:18,176 --> 00:11:19,476
temporarily indicate that it's

447
00:11:19,476 --> 00:11:21,236
not available you can mark it as

448
00:11:21,236 --> 00:11:21,656
disabled.

449
00:11:21,946 --> 00:11:24,066
The method or block that you

450
00:11:24,066 --> 00:11:25,496
provide must return an enum

451
00:11:25,496 --> 00:11:27,006
value to indicate if your app

452
00:11:27,006 --> 00:11:28,426
was able to successfully perform

453
00:11:28,426 --> 00:11:28,876
the command.

454
00:11:29,676 --> 00:11:30,986
The definition of success here

455
00:11:30,986 --> 00:11:31,586
is pretty broad.

456
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:33,196
For example, if the user is

457
00:11:33,196 --> 00:11:34,176
playing the last song in a

458
00:11:34,176 --> 00:11:35,716
playlist and requests to skip to

459
00:11:35,716 --> 00:11:37,336
the next track your app may

460
00:11:37,336 --> 00:11:38,796
choose to simply end playback.

461
00:11:39,266 --> 00:11:40,426
That would still be considered

462
00:11:40,426 --> 00:11:41,586
successfully handling the

463
00:11:41,586 --> 00:11:42,946
command so you should return the

464
00:11:42,946 --> 00:11:45,006
success value in that case.

465
00:11:47,056 --> 00:11:48,086
Some commands like play and

466
00:11:48,086 --> 00:11:49,046
pause are pretty simple.

467
00:11:49,316 --> 00:11:50,616
If the handler for the pause

468
00:11:50,616 --> 00:11:51,776
command is invoked it's pretty

469
00:11:51,776 --> 00:11:52,906
clear what your app needs to do.

470
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:54,466
But other commands are more

471
00:11:54,466 --> 00:11:56,176
flexible and both accept

472
00:11:56,176 --> 00:11:57,826
parameters from your app and can

473
00:11:57,826 --> 00:11:59,236
provide more parameters back to

474
00:11:59,236 --> 00:11:59,806
your handler.

475
00:12:00,906 --> 00:12:01,706
For example, the

476
00:12:01,706 --> 00:12:03,696
MPSkipIntervalCommand is used to

477
00:12:03,696 --> 00:12:05,236
allow the user to skip forward

478
00:12:05,236 --> 00:12:06,506
or backward by several seconds.

479
00:12:07,366 --> 00:12:08,206
Your app can express a

480
00:12:08,206 --> 00:12:09,516
preference for how many seconds

481
00:12:09,516 --> 00:12:10,306
the user should be allowed to

482
00:12:10,306 --> 00:12:10,646
skip.

483
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:12,626
The skip command object allows

484
00:12:12,626 --> 00:12:13,336
you to configure that

485
00:12:13,336 --> 00:12:13,756
preference.

486
00:12:14,076 --> 00:12:16,326
When the user actually performs

487
00:12:16,326 --> 00:12:17,776
the skip command your handler

488
00:12:17,776 --> 00:12:18,936
will be invoked with an object

489
00:12:18,936 --> 00:12:19,416
parameter.

490
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:21,356
That object is of the type

491
00:12:21,356 --> 00:12:23,396
MPSkipIntervalCommandEvent and

492
00:12:23,396 --> 00:12:25,046
it has an interval property that

493
00:12:25,046 --> 00:12:26,226
tells your app how many seconds

494
00:12:26,226 --> 00:12:26,696
you should skip.

495
00:12:27,276 --> 00:12:28,676
And be careful this may not be

496
00:12:28,676 --> 00:12:30,126
the same as the skip preference

497
00:12:30,126 --> 00:12:30,986
you provided earlier.

498
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:33,376
Let's look at an example.

499
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:34,816
Here's how an app might

500
00:12:34,816 --> 00:12:35,956
implement the skip backward

501
00:12:35,956 --> 00:12:36,316
command.

502
00:12:37,816 --> 00:12:38,836
You can see here that on the

503
00:12:38,836 --> 00:12:40,266
first line I would prefer that

504
00:12:40,266 --> 00:12:41,616
the user skips backward by 10

505
00:12:41,616 --> 00:12:43,326
second intervals so I'm going to

506
00:12:43,326 --> 00:12:44,816
assign the preferred intervals

507
00:12:44,816 --> 00:12:46,136
property on the

508
00:12:46,136 --> 00:12:47,636
SkipBackwardCommand object.

509
00:12:48,006 --> 00:12:50,736
Then I'm going to provide my

510
00:12:50,736 --> 00:12:51,366
handler block.

511
00:12:51,906 --> 00:12:53,166
Now technically every command

512
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:54,426
handler receives the generic

513
00:12:54,426 --> 00:12:56,746
type MPRemoteCommandEvent as the

514
00:12:56,746 --> 00:12:58,776
parameter, but I need to cast it

515
00:12:58,776 --> 00:13:00,696
to an MPSkipIntervalCommandEvent

516
00:12:58,776 --> 00:13:00,696
to an MPSkipIntervalCommandEvent

517
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:01,346
so that I can get to its

518
00:13:01,346 --> 00:13:01,966
interval property.

519
00:13:05,276 --> 00:13:06,196
Then I'm going to actually

520
00:13:06,196 --> 00:13:06,776
perform the command.

521
00:13:07,316 --> 00:13:08,416
In this sample, I'm playing my

522
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:09,626
content with an AVPlayer.

523
00:13:10,286 --> 00:13:11,756
Since AVPlayer expresses its

524
00:13:11,756 --> 00:13:13,736
time using CMTime structs that's

525
00:13:13,736 --> 00:13:14,426
how I'm going to need to

526
00:13:14,426 --> 00:13:15,576
calculate my new playback

527
00:13:15,576 --> 00:13:15,926
position.

528
00:13:17,226 --> 00:13:18,136
You can see here that I'm

529
00:13:18,136 --> 00:13:18,976
getting the player's current

530
00:13:18,976 --> 00:13:20,986
composition then creating a new

531
00:13:20,986 --> 00:13:22,516
CMTime struct with the skip

532
00:13:22,516 --> 00:13:22,916
interval.

533
00:13:23,946 --> 00:13:25,136
Finally, I'm subtracting that

534
00:13:25,136 --> 00:13:26,336
interval from the current time.

535
00:13:27,486 --> 00:13:29,326
I ask the player to seek to that

536
00:13:29,326 --> 00:13:30,776
time and then return successful

537
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:31,566
from the command handler.

538
00:13:32,066 --> 00:13:34,376
When the player finishes seeking

539
00:13:34,376 --> 00:13:36,056
to the new time my completion

540
00:13:36,056 --> 00:13:37,296
handler will be invoked and

541
00:13:37,296 --> 00:13:38,226
that's where I'm going to update

542
00:13:38,226 --> 00:13:39,016
my Now Playing info.

543
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:41,146
Remember, if we modify playback

544
00:13:41,146 --> 00:13:42,576
state like seeking to a new time

545
00:13:42,906 --> 00:13:44,036
we need to publish new Now

546
00:13:44,036 --> 00:13:45,446
Playing info so we can update

547
00:13:45,446 --> 00:13:46,406
the elapsed playback time.

548
00:13:47,306 --> 00:13:48,336
Here I'm calling a function

549
00:13:48,336 --> 00:13:49,826
called updateNowPlaying which

550
00:13:49,826 --> 00:13:51,476
I'll show you on this next

551
00:13:51,976 --> 00:13:52,106
slide.

552
00:13:53,276 --> 00:13:54,246
Here you can see how I'm going

553
00:13:54,246 --> 00:13:55,416
to update my Now Playing info.

554
00:13:55,806 --> 00:13:56,846
This is basically the same as

555
00:13:56,846 --> 00:13:57,906
the example I showed you at the

556
00:13:57,906 --> 00:13:59,356
beginning of this section, but

557
00:13:59,356 --> 00:14:00,706
want to call out one specific

558
00:13:59,356 --> 00:14:00,706
want to call out one specific

559
00:14:00,706 --> 00:14:01,046
detail.

560
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:03,286
Here you can see that I'm using

561
00:14:03,286 --> 00:14:04,826
the AVPlayer's current time

562
00:14:04,826 --> 00:14:06,666
property in order to provide an

563
00:14:06,736 --> 00:14:08,246
accurate value for the elapsed

564
00:14:08,246 --> 00:14:09,166
playback time property.

565
00:14:10,076 --> 00:14:11,626
In this case, since AVPlayer is

566
00:14:11,626 --> 00:14:13,796
going to return a CMTime, but

567
00:14:13,796 --> 00:14:15,406
MPNowPlayingInfoCenter requires

568
00:14:15,406 --> 00:14:16,586
a floating-point value, that's

569
00:14:16,646 --> 00:14:18,326
the number of elapsed seconds, I

570
00:14:18,326 --> 00:14:20,506
need to use the CMTimeGetSeconds

571
00:14:20,506 --> 00:14:21,766
function to convert the value.

572
00:14:22,816 --> 00:14:23,806
And that's all there is to

573
00:14:23,806 --> 00:14:25,056
providing a great playback

574
00:14:25,056 --> 00:14:26,336
experience with Remote Commands

575
00:14:26,336 --> 00:14:27,356
and Now Playing information.

576
00:14:28,446 --> 00:14:29,456
For more information, you can
