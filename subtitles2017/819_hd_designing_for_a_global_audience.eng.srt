00:00:08,516 --> 00:00:16,500
[ Cheers ]

2
00:00:22,686 --> 00:00:24,776
&gt;&gt; You have a global audience,

3
00:00:25,506 --> 00:00:26,816
the world is increasingly

4
00:00:26,816 --> 00:00:29,906
interconnected, people travel

5
00:00:30,316 --> 00:00:32,106
and when they do they use apps

6
00:00:32,176 --> 00:00:33,496
to orient themselves in new

7
00:00:33,496 --> 00:00:35,396
places and figure out what to

8
00:00:35,396 --> 00:00:37,796
do, where to eat and how to get

9
00:00:37,796 --> 00:00:38,256
around.

10
00:00:40,256 --> 00:00:42,206
And people move for all sorts of

11
00:00:42,206 --> 00:00:44,336
reasons, so in any given place

12
00:00:44,476 --> 00:00:45,906
you're likely to find people

13
00:00:45,906 --> 00:00:47,136
from different countries,

14
00:00:47,526 --> 00:00:49,476
cultures and language groups.

15
00:00:51,106 --> 00:00:53,916
And here at WWDC, we are part of

16
00:00:53,916 --> 00:00:56,126
a group representing 75

17
00:00:56,126 --> 00:00:57,106
different countries.

18
00:00:59,176 --> 00:01:01,986
So why design for this global

19
00:00:59,176 --> 00:01:01,986
So why design for this global

20
00:01:01,986 --> 00:01:02,496
audience?

21
00:01:03,836 --> 00:01:06,286
First and most importantly, for

22
00:01:06,286 --> 00:01:08,146
a better user experience.

23
00:01:08,706 --> 00:01:09,986
Language and symbols are

24
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:12,186
grounded in cultural context so

25
00:01:12,186 --> 00:01:14,006
not all of us interpret things

26
00:01:14,076 --> 00:01:14,916
in the same way.

27
00:01:15,616 --> 00:01:16,986
It's important of course, to

28
00:01:16,986 --> 00:01:18,236
make sure that your words and

29
00:01:18,306 --> 00:01:19,676
artwork aren't offensive to your

30
00:01:19,676 --> 00:01:21,936
users, but don't stop there.

31
00:01:22,676 --> 00:01:23,916
Carefully considering your

32
00:01:23,916 --> 00:01:25,886
global audience can help make

33
00:01:25,886 --> 00:01:28,046
your app as useful and appealing

34
00:01:28,346 --> 00:01:29,936
to as many people as possible.

35
00:01:31,606 --> 00:01:33,166
And thinking this way sets you

36
00:01:33,166 --> 00:01:33,636
up to grow.

37
00:01:34,536 --> 00:01:35,856
The App Store is available

38
00:01:35,856 --> 00:01:38,146
around the world so people from

39
00:01:38,256 --> 00:01:39,616
any country that you've enabled

40
00:01:39,616 --> 00:01:41,546
in iTunes Connect can view and

41
00:01:41,546 --> 00:01:43,046
download your app.

42
00:01:43,096 --> 00:01:44,786
Whether your app is only in one

43
00:01:44,786 --> 00:01:46,176
language right now or you're

44
00:01:46,176 --> 00:01:48,226
already in multiple markets the

45
00:01:48,226 --> 00:01:49,946
principles we'll discuss are

46
00:01:49,946 --> 00:01:51,336
relevant to you no matter what.

47
00:01:52,646 --> 00:01:53,696
So, let's get started.

48
00:01:54,636 --> 00:01:56,436
First, make a plan.

49
00:01:57,386 --> 00:01:58,626
Think about your strategic

50
00:01:58,626 --> 00:02:00,546
goals, which countries and

51
00:01:58,626 --> 00:02:00,546
goals, which countries and

52
00:02:00,546 --> 00:02:01,806
languages are next on your

53
00:02:01,806 --> 00:02:03,496
roadmap, if you have one

54
00:02:03,496 --> 00:02:05,146
already, and don't forget to

55
00:02:05,196 --> 00:02:06,146
take a look at your app

56
00:02:06,146 --> 00:02:07,936
analytics in iTunes Connect

57
00:02:08,356 --> 00:02:09,826
that's some useful information,

58
00:02:09,826 --> 00:02:11,015
you might find something there

59
00:02:11,015 --> 00:02:11,936
that's surprising.

60
00:02:13,206 --> 00:02:15,686
Next, identify your user groups

61
00:02:16,576 --> 00:02:17,866
and think about how best to

62
00:02:17,866 --> 00:02:19,106
communicate with them.

63
00:02:19,616 --> 00:02:21,076
Can you get by with some minor

64
00:02:21,076 --> 00:02:22,246
changes to your app.

65
00:02:22,676 --> 00:02:24,486
Is it time to think seriously

66
00:02:24,566 --> 00:02:26,416
about a major localization

67
00:02:26,656 --> 00:02:27,076
effort.

68
00:02:28,056 --> 00:02:29,336
Use this information to

69
00:02:29,336 --> 00:02:30,826
prioritize your important

70
00:02:30,826 --> 00:02:32,706
localization work and think

71
00:02:32,706 --> 00:02:34,276
about ways to streamline.

72
00:02:35,226 --> 00:02:36,736
Make sure that you have

73
00:02:36,736 --> 00:02:38,476
translations for your key terms

74
00:02:38,476 --> 00:02:40,286
before you need them and if

75
00:02:40,286 --> 00:02:41,746
you're going to have a second

76
00:02:41,746 --> 00:02:43,526
set of artwork for example for a

77
00:02:43,526 --> 00:02:45,326
different market get it all done

78
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:47,676
at the same time.

79
00:02:48,226 --> 00:02:49,836
So, let's discuss some key

80
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:51,596
considerations related to

81
00:02:51,596 --> 00:02:52,276
language.

82
00:02:54,306 --> 00:02:55,756
When terms can be used more or

83
00:02:55,756 --> 00:02:57,266
less interchangeably in your

84
00:02:57,266 --> 00:02:59,786
app's primary language is there

85
00:02:59,786 --> 00:03:01,576
one choice that's very similar

86
00:02:59,786 --> 00:03:01,576
one choice that's very similar

87
00:03:01,576 --> 00:03:02,916
to other languages.

88
00:03:03,506 --> 00:03:05,236
For example, picture and photo

89
00:03:05,236 --> 00:03:06,746
are more or less the same in

90
00:03:06,746 --> 00:03:07,726
English, but look at the

91
00:03:07,726 --> 00:03:08,976
difference in these other

92
00:03:08,976 --> 00:03:09,746
languages.

93
00:03:09,796 --> 00:03:13,676
Photo is the clear winner for

94
00:03:13,676 --> 00:03:14,966
multilingual clarity.

95
00:03:15,616 --> 00:03:19,846
If you have the resources to

96
00:03:19,846 --> 00:03:22,106
fully translate your app go for

97
00:03:22,696 --> 00:03:24,846
it, but if not prioritize.

98
00:03:25,996 --> 00:03:27,296
Help your users orient

99
00:03:27,296 --> 00:03:28,796
themselves with headings and

100
00:03:28,796 --> 00:03:29,296
titles.

101
00:03:30,926 --> 00:03:32,266
Make sure that the important

102
00:03:32,266 --> 00:03:33,256
information from your

103
00:03:33,336 --> 00:03:35,206
instructions is conveyed and

104
00:03:36,346 --> 00:03:38,076
that commonly used terms are

105
00:03:38,076 --> 00:03:38,436
clear.

106
00:03:39,606 --> 00:03:41,526
Finally, make sure that users

107
00:03:41,526 --> 00:03:43,436
can read error messages just in

108
00:03:43,436 --> 00:03:45,406
case something goes wrong.

109
00:03:47,056 --> 00:03:49,576
Think about informal language

110
00:03:49,576 --> 00:03:49,906
too.

111
00:03:51,066 --> 00:03:52,876
You may choose to include slang,

112
00:03:53,306 --> 00:03:55,306
very informal words or phrases

113
00:03:55,826 --> 00:03:57,656
or figures of speech, words or

114
00:03:57,656 --> 00:03:59,246
phrases that are not intended to

115
00:03:59,246 --> 00:04:00,266
be taken literally.

116
00:03:59,246 --> 00:04:00,266
be taken literally.

117
00:04:00,766 --> 00:04:01,806
Let's look at a couple of

118
00:04:01,806 --> 00:04:02,436
examples.

119
00:04:02,556 --> 00:04:04,526
I am a native Californian and I

120
00:04:04,696 --> 00:04:09,016
might say oh sick, you crush it

121
00:04:09,766 --> 00:04:12,446
or sweet, that rocked.

122
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:15,146
But here I'm not talking about

123
00:04:15,146 --> 00:04:16,766
illnesses or desserts just

124
00:04:16,766 --> 00:04:17,766
saying that someone did

125
00:04:17,766 --> 00:04:19,356
something particularly well.

126
00:04:20,055 --> 00:04:22,546
I may also say it's raining cats

127
00:04:22,546 --> 00:04:22,976
and dogs.

128
00:04:29,046 --> 00:04:29,696
I love the last one.

129
00:04:29,986 --> 00:04:32,166
Or I'm hungry enough to eat a

130
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:32,606
horse.

131
00:04:33,406 --> 00:04:34,876
This kind of language adds

132
00:04:34,876 --> 00:04:36,656
character to an app, so I'm

133
00:04:36,656 --> 00:04:38,586
certainly not saying never to

134
00:04:38,586 --> 00:04:39,116
use it.

135
00:04:39,426 --> 00:04:41,226
But if you do, do a quick check

136
00:04:41,226 --> 00:04:42,246
to make sure that it's not

137
00:04:42,246 --> 00:04:43,776
offensive and be sure to offer

138
00:04:43,776 --> 00:04:45,906
contextual clues so that even if

139
00:04:45,906 --> 00:04:47,346
a user isn't totally sure what

140
00:04:47,346 --> 00:04:49,076
you mean they can still figure

141
00:04:50,226 --> 00:04:51,266
it out.

142
00:04:52,196 --> 00:04:54,086
Let's talk now about symbology

143
00:04:55,386 --> 00:04:56,716
and do a quick exercise.

144
00:04:57,676 --> 00:04:59,776
Put your hand up and count one,

145
00:05:00,076 --> 00:05:01,256
two, three.

146
00:05:02,966 --> 00:05:06,366
Okay now hold that and take a

147
00:05:06,366 --> 00:05:07,036
look around.

148
00:05:07,636 --> 00:05:08,836
How many people have their

149
00:05:08,886 --> 00:05:11,186
thumb, index finger and third

150
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:12,226
finger extended?

151
00:05:13,326 --> 00:05:15,396
How about index, third and ring

152
00:05:16,336 --> 00:05:17,396
or maybe something else

153
00:05:17,396 --> 00:05:18,196
entirely?

154
00:05:18,836 --> 00:05:21,646
This is a great example of the

155
00:05:21,646 --> 00:05:24,096
wide variation in gestures for

156
00:05:24,096 --> 00:05:25,896
something as simple as counting

157
00:05:25,896 --> 00:05:26,406
to three.

158
00:05:27,746 --> 00:05:28,946
If you choose to include

159
00:05:28,946 --> 00:05:30,786
gestures in your app make sure

160
00:05:30,786 --> 00:05:31,976
that it means what you intend

161
00:05:32,006 --> 00:05:34,726
and plan ahead to localize when

162
00:05:34,726 --> 00:05:35,206
appropriate.

163
00:05:35,426 --> 00:05:39,796
Now let's talk about localized

164
00:05:39,796 --> 00:05:41,566
and globalized iconography with

165
00:05:41,566 --> 00:05:42,926
an example from our Maps app.

166
00:05:43,466 --> 00:05:44,666
We're about to look at the set

167
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:46,156
of icons that we use to

168
00:05:46,156 --> 00:05:47,576
represent an important feature

169
00:05:47,576 --> 00:05:48,646
in different countries.

170
00:05:49,096 --> 00:05:51,376
So, who knows what this

171
00:05:51,376 --> 00:05:52,056
represents?

172
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:56,156
Okay a couple hands.

173
00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:58,996
How about this?

174
00:05:58,996 --> 00:06:00,426
Getting warmer all right, many

175
00:05:58,996 --> 00:06:00,426
Getting warmer all right, many

176
00:06:00,426 --> 00:06:01,046
more hands.

177
00:06:02,266 --> 00:06:04,516
And about this?

178
00:06:04,626 --> 00:06:06,306
All right, just about everybody.

179
00:06:08,136 --> 00:06:09,876
So, this is the logo of Japan

180
00:06:09,876 --> 00:06:11,886
Post which we use to represent

181
00:06:11,886 --> 00:06:14,156
post offices, but only in Japan.

182
00:06:15,256 --> 00:06:17,006
This is the postal horn which we

183
00:06:17,006 --> 00:06:18,466
use in Sweden, Turkey,

184
00:06:18,466 --> 00:06:20,196
Luxembourg and 28 other

185
00:06:20,196 --> 00:06:20,826
countries.

186
00:06:21,616 --> 00:06:22,926
And finally, in every other

187
00:06:22,926 --> 00:06:24,956
country we use this simple

188
00:06:24,956 --> 00:06:26,996
recognizable letter outline to

189
00:06:26,996 --> 00:06:29,246
symbolize the post office.

190
00:06:29,246 --> 00:06:30,326
I like this example because I

191
00:06:30,326 --> 00:06:31,426
think it represents a nice

192
00:06:31,526 --> 00:06:33,626
spectrum of local to global

193
00:06:33,626 --> 00:06:34,516
iconography.

194
00:06:34,986 --> 00:06:36,176
And there's really no right

195
00:06:36,176 --> 00:06:37,586
answer here, but it's an

196
00:06:37,586 --> 00:06:38,826
important question for you to

197
00:06:38,826 --> 00:06:41,166
consider, exactly how specific

198
00:06:41,286 --> 00:06:42,666
do you want to be with your

199
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:43,246
symbols.

200
00:06:43,926 --> 00:06:49,386
When depicting people keep in

201
00:06:49,386 --> 00:06:51,066
mind that more detailed icons

202
00:06:51,066 --> 00:06:52,796
may exclude some of your users,

203
00:06:53,636 --> 00:06:54,976
but that simpler glyphs like

204
00:06:55,006 --> 00:06:56,376
this silhouette are much more

205
00:06:56,426 --> 00:06:58,116
general and maybe a better

206
00:06:58,116 --> 00:06:58,396
choice.

207
00:06:58,946 --> 00:07:00,766
And as a bonus, we include this

208
00:06:58,946 --> 00:07:00,766
And as a bonus, we include this

209
00:07:00,766 --> 00:07:02,656
glyph in UIKit so that artwork

210
00:07:02,656 --> 00:07:04,166
is already available to you.

211
00:07:04,846 --> 00:07:07,806
Let's talk about our final

212
00:07:07,806 --> 00:07:10,336
consideration now, associations.

213
00:07:12,086 --> 00:07:13,346
What does this owl make you

214
00:07:13,346 --> 00:07:13,856
think of?

215
00:07:15,636 --> 00:07:16,986
If you grew up in an

216
00:07:16,986 --> 00:07:19,236
English-speaking context you may

217
00:07:19,236 --> 00:07:21,756
associate owls with wisdom, but

218
00:07:21,756 --> 00:07:23,036
in much of the Arabic speaking

219
00:07:23,036 --> 00:07:25,356
world owls can be associated

220
00:07:25,446 --> 00:07:26,916
with bad luck or even death.

221
00:07:27,336 --> 00:07:28,586
So, make sure that your

222
00:07:28,586 --> 00:07:30,016
associations are what you

223
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:30,456
expect.

224
00:07:30,526 --> 00:07:33,556
I hope I have helped you to

225
00:07:33,556 --> 00:07:35,726
think further or start thinking

226
00:07:35,726 --> 00:07:37,076
about designing for your global

227
00:07:37,076 --> 00:07:37,766
audience.

228
00:07:38,156 --> 00:07:39,066
Now let's look at some

229
00:07:39,066 --> 00:07:39,836
resources.

230
00:07:40,896 --> 00:07:42,926
First, if you can travel to the

231
00:07:42,926 --> 00:07:44,546
places where your customers live

232
00:07:44,866 --> 00:07:46,696
I hope you will, but not

233
00:07:46,696 --> 00:07:47,786
everyone can travel.

234
00:07:47,976 --> 00:07:49,476
Never fear there are other

235
00:07:49,476 --> 00:07:51,156
resources much closer to home.

236
00:07:52,706 --> 00:07:54,126
Could you conduct focus groups

237
00:07:54,746 --> 00:07:56,506
either formal focus groups with

238
00:07:56,506 --> 00:07:58,456
participants selected based on

239
00:07:58,456 --> 00:08:00,506
their primary language, cultural

240
00:07:58,456 --> 00:08:00,506
their primary language, cultural

241
00:08:00,506 --> 00:08:01,406
background or other

242
00:08:01,406 --> 00:08:04,036
characteristics or possibly more

243
00:08:04,036 --> 00:08:05,936
informal focus groups where you

244
00:08:05,936 --> 00:08:07,336
offer snacks to friends or

245
00:08:07,336 --> 00:08:08,966
family in exchange for their

246
00:08:08,966 --> 00:08:10,256
feedback on your designs?

247
00:08:12,086 --> 00:08:13,156
You may be able to draw on

248
00:08:13,156 --> 00:08:14,386
personal or professional

249
00:08:14,386 --> 00:08:15,486
contacts for this kind of

250
00:08:15,486 --> 00:08:16,426
feedback as well.

251
00:08:17,586 --> 00:08:19,076
And now moving to the web,

252
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,556
language learning, translation

253
00:08:21,556 --> 00:08:23,686
and travel funds offer a wealth

254
00:08:23,746 --> 00:08:25,316
of knowledge about language and

255
00:08:25,316 --> 00:08:27,216
symbol use and expectations

256
00:08:27,216 --> 00:08:28,036
around the world.

257
00:08:28,646 --> 00:08:30,046
And web and image searches can

258
00:08:30,046 --> 00:08:30,886
give you a lot of this

259
00:08:30,886 --> 00:08:31,926
information too.

260
00:08:33,706 --> 00:08:34,826
Books and articles can be

261
00:08:34,826 --> 00:08:36,456
helpful as well, look for

262
00:08:36,456 --> 00:08:38,265
keywords like global design,

263
00:08:38,466 --> 00:08:40,966
user experience, intercultural

264
00:08:40,966 --> 00:08:42,946
or cross-cultural communication,

265
00:08:43,275 --> 00:08:45,216
visual design and tips for

266
00:08:45,216 --> 00:08:47,416
travelers, businesspeople and

267
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:48,306
interpreters.

268
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:51,456
Finally, don't forget about

269
00:08:51,456 --> 00:08:53,116
libraries where you can find

270
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:54,756
some of these publications, as

271
00:08:54,756 --> 00:08:55,986
well as map and document

272
00:08:55,986 --> 00:08:57,216
collections with rich

273
00:08:57,216 --> 00:08:58,076
information.

274
00:08:59,336 --> 00:09:02,906
So, to wrap it all up, this is

275
00:08:59,336 --> 00:09:02,906
So, to wrap it all up, this is

276
00:09:02,906 --> 00:09:04,676
not an all or nothing design

277
00:09:04,676 --> 00:09:07,056
problem, smart changes can go a

278
00:09:07,056 --> 00:09:08,626
long way toward making your app

279
00:09:08,836 --> 00:09:10,776
more useful for more people.

280
00:09:11,896 --> 00:09:13,166
Use the resources that are

281
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:15,126
available to you to create a

282
00:09:15,126 --> 00:09:18,036
great user experience and lay

283
00:09:18,036 --> 00:09:19,506
the groundwork for expansion.

284
00:09:20,656 --> 00:09:21,146
You can do this.

285
00:09:21,146 --> 00:09:21,896
Thank you.
