Today's speaker is incredible.

21
00:01:00,036 --> 00:01:02,756
Todd Stabelfeldt was injured at

00:01:02,756 --> 00:01:04,575
an early age in an accident that

23
00:01:04,575 --> 00:01:05,656
left him paralyzed.

24
00:01:06,786 --> 00:01:08,016
Some might have considered that

25
00:01:08,586 --> 00:01:10,706
an insurmountable obstacle.

26
00:01:11,996 --> 00:01:13,046
Not so with Todd.

27
00:01:14,376 --> 00:01:17,756
He is simply a force into

28
00:01:17,756 --> 00:01:18,216
himself.

29
00:01:19,516 --> 00:01:23,456
So, I found personally from

30
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:25,336
working with him, that to know

31
00:01:25,336 --> 00:01:26,066
him is to love him.

where we're at today, OK?

125
00:04:41,786 --> 00:04:43,246

128
00:05:00,076 --> 00:05:01,656
&gt;&gt; Hi. I'm Todd Stabelfeldt.

129
00:05:01,656 --> 00:05:04,266
I was paralyzed in 1987 due to a

130
00:05:04,266 --> 00:05:04,906
gunshot wound.

131
00:05:04,906 --> 00:05:06,326
My cousin and I were playing

132
00:05:06,326 --> 00:05:07,286
with some guns, and

133
00:05:07,286 --> 00:05:09,006
unfortunately, that resulted in

134
00:05:09,006 --> 00:05:10,236
what's called C4 quadriplegia.

135
00:05:10,236 --> 00:05:12,156
I'm able to move from my

136
00:05:12,156 --> 00:05:14,036
shoulders up, and from the

137
00:05:14,036 --> 00:05:15,246
shoulders down is essentially

138
00:05:15,246 --> 00:05:16,306
gone.

139
00:05:16,306 --> 00:05:17,926
Once you're paralyzed, you're

140
00:05:17,926 --> 00:05:19,226
almost sort of reborn.

141
00:05:19,226 --> 00:05:21,286
And you start all over again.

142
00:05:21,286 --> 00:05:22,346
Because now you can't do

143
00:05:22,346 --> 00:05:23,156
anything for yourself.

144
00:05:23,476 --> 00:05:24,876
I learned quickly as a young

145
00:05:24,876 --> 00:05:26,456
kid, what my life was going to

146
00:05:26,456 --> 00:05:28,046
be all about, putting solutions

147
00:05:28,046 --> 00:05:28,796
together.

148
00:05:28,796 --> 00:05:30,526
Back then, it was really, really

149
00:05:30,526 --> 00:05:32,796
crude approaches to just try to

150
00:05:32,796 --> 00:05:34,636
have any shred of independence.

151
00:05:34,636 --> 00:05:36,126
And one of the real systemic

152
00:05:36,126 --> 00:05:37,426
problems was communication,

153
00:05:37,726 --> 00:05:38,496
especially at that sort of

154
00:05:38,496 --> 00:05:39,326
mobile level.

155
00:05:39,326 --> 00:05:41,016
You know, with a spinal cord

156
00:05:41,016 --> 00:05:42,466
injury, essentially we are

157
00:05:42,466 --> 00:05:43,726
reduced to our voice.

158
00:05:43,856 --> 00:05:45,866
Voice recognition has come a

159
00:05:45,866 --> 00:05:46,346
long way.

160
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,426
It's been amazing.

161
00:05:47,426 --> 00:05:48,276
It's been awesome.

162
00:05:48,276 --> 00:05:51,186
The one piece that was always

163
00:05:51,186 --> 00:05:53,096
missing, you had to press a

164
00:05:53,096 --> 00:05:55,246
button to start.

165
00:05:55,246 --> 00:05:56,626
You had to press a button to

166
00:05:56,816 --> 00:05:57,606
engage.

167
00:05:57,786 --> 00:05:59,176
So, something that was so

168
00:05:59,176 --> 00:06:01,086
amazing, and always so close and

169
00:05:59,176 --> 00:06:01,086
amazing, and always so close and

170
00:06:01,086 --> 00:06:02,346
oh, you could taste it.

171
00:06:02,386 --> 00:06:04,916
To me was never going to be a

172
00:06:04,916 --> 00:06:06,776
reality, because I can't put the

173
00:06:07,026 --> 00:06:08,976
button.

174
00:06:09,146 --> 00:06:11,236
And then, something fascinating

175
00:06:11,236 --> 00:06:11,546
occurred.

176
00:06:11,546 --> 00:06:13,506
iOS 7 was released.

177
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:15,126
And in that operating system,

178
00:06:15,126 --> 00:06:17,736
came this concept and reality

179
00:06:17,736 --> 00:06:18,766
that says, hey you know what,

180
00:06:18,766 --> 00:06:20,296
you don't have to put this

181
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:20,666
button.

182
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:21,656
How about you push your button.

183
00:06:21,656 --> 00:06:23,646
Whatever the configuration that

184
00:06:23,646 --> 00:06:26,426
your story is, we are adapting

185
00:06:26,426 --> 00:06:28,286
our operating system around you.

186
00:06:28,286 --> 00:06:30,416
For me, communication is a big

187
00:06:30,486 --> 00:06:31,586
deal.

188
00:06:31,586 --> 00:06:34,196
Being intendent is a big deal.

189
00:06:34,526 --> 00:06:36,356
And when I worked with Siri for

190
00:06:36,356 --> 00:06:37,936
the first time, to interact with

191
00:06:37,936 --> 00:06:38,966
her and understand how she

192
00:06:38,966 --> 00:06:40,616
works, and to create a calendar

193
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:43,276
appointment with a colleague and

194
00:06:43,276 --> 00:06:44,586
then check my computer to make

195
00:06:44,586 --> 00:06:46,016
sure it was real.

196
00:06:46,016 --> 00:06:47,276
I was blown away.

197
00:06:47,276 --> 00:06:49,706
I mean, Apple is now touching

198
00:06:49,706 --> 00:06:51,736
people at this human experience

199
00:06:51,736 --> 00:06:52,706
level.

200
00:06:52,706 --> 00:06:54,586
To be a part of texting my wife

201
00:06:54,696 --> 00:06:56,186
without somebody else doing it.

202
00:06:56,186 --> 00:06:59,136
Words, in this current language

203
00:06:59,206 --> 00:07:00,936
do not even identify that

204
00:06:59,206 --> 00:07:00,936
do not even identify that

205
00:07:00,936 --> 00:07:01,576
feeling.

206
00:07:02,516 --> 00:07:09,806
[ Applause ]

207
00:07:10,306 --> 00:07:14,136
&gt;&gt; That was a very difficult

208
00:07:14,776 --> 00:07:15,836
film to create.

209
00:07:15,836 --> 00:07:17,686
And a wonderful film to create.

210
00:07:18,766 --> 00:07:20,376
And my buddy Mark McNight and I

211
00:07:20,376 --> 00:07:20,936
did that.

212
00:07:22,046 --> 00:07:23,576
It was a couple years back now.

213
00:07:24,536 --> 00:07:25,586
But let me tell you real quick,

214
00:07:25,586 --> 00:07:27,276
how I sort of got to that video.

215
00:07:28,056 --> 00:07:29,216
Because that's where it sort of

216
00:07:29,216 --> 00:07:32,126
explains sort of the situation.

217
00:07:32,656 --> 00:07:36,216
So, I was born, now it seems

218
00:07:36,216 --> 00:07:37,506
weird to say, a long time ago.

219
00:07:38,506 --> 00:07:39,796
Back in the seventies, can you

220
00:07:39,796 --> 00:07:40,596
believe it?

221
00:07:40,596 --> 00:07:43,686
And mom, dad, sister normal

222
00:07:43,686 --> 00:07:44,166
routine.

223
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:47,196
Grew up in a very Navy, very

224
00:07:47,196 --> 00:07:48,696
southern, and very German

225
00:07:48,696 --> 00:07:51,216
household; the trifecta.

226
00:07:52,906 --> 00:07:54,186
Failure wasn't an option.

227
00:07:55,616 --> 00:07:56,886
Everybody was valuable.

228
00:07:58,256 --> 00:08:00,706
Everybody was responsible for

229
00:07:58,256 --> 00:08:00,706
Everybody was responsible for

230
00:08:00,706 --> 00:08:03,506
putting groceries on the table.

231
00:08:03,596 --> 00:08:05,066
And you always told the truth.

232
00:08:05,546 --> 00:08:07,576
That's the way I was brought.

233
00:08:07,746 --> 00:08:08,636
That's the way I was raised.

234
00:08:09,806 --> 00:08:10,966
Four years into my story,

235
00:08:10,966 --> 00:08:12,146
unfortunately my dad died in a

236
00:08:12,146 --> 00:08:14,846
horrific motorcycle accident.

237
00:08:16,216 --> 00:08:17,636
Four years later, now in it's in

238
00:08:17,636 --> 00:08:19,286
the eighties, mom decides to

239
00:08:19,596 --> 00:08:20,706
remodel her bedroom.

240
00:08:20,816 --> 00:08:22,176
She puts all these old antique

241
00:08:22,526 --> 00:08:23,976
guns and bullets into a spare

242
00:08:23,976 --> 00:08:24,436
room.

243
00:08:24,436 --> 00:08:26,516
It was the eighties.

244
00:08:26,516 --> 00:08:27,016
Come on man.

245
00:08:27,016 --> 00:08:28,576
We had Bruce Willis Nakatomi

246
00:08:28,576 --> 00:08:29,096
Building.

247
00:08:29,096 --> 00:08:30,826
We've got little baby Sylvester

248
00:08:30,826 --> 00:08:31,716
doing his thing.

249
00:08:31,966 --> 00:08:33,936
And we had Commando, right.

250
00:08:33,936 --> 00:08:35,716
WW 3 wasn't anywhere around the

251
00:08:36,246 --> 00:08:36,556
corner.

252
00:08:36,556 --> 00:08:37,626
Chewed my graham crackers into a

253
00:08:37,626 --> 00:08:38,015
gun.

254
00:08:38,116 --> 00:08:39,895
This is what we did back then.

255
00:08:41,176 --> 00:08:42,466
So, sadly without knowing

256
00:08:42,466 --> 00:08:43,496
anything really about guns and

257
00:08:43,496 --> 00:08:44,496
how they worked, I got shot.

258
00:08:45,016 --> 00:08:46,946
And that was at 8 years old.

259
00:08:47,466 --> 00:08:49,756
Fast forward a bit more, when I

260
00:08:50,206 --> 00:08:52,346
was a teenager, my mom got

261
00:08:52,346 --> 00:08:52,856
remarried.

262
00:08:52,856 --> 00:08:55,196
And in that process I got a dad.

263
00:08:56,226 --> 00:08:57,346
Dan Alberts.

264
00:08:57,346 --> 00:09:00,176
I got a dad.

265
00:08:57,346 --> 00:09:00,176
I got a dad.

266
00:09:03,326 --> 00:09:04,516
And also in that acquisition of

267
00:09:04,516 --> 00:09:05,496
marriage I got two brothers and

268
00:09:05,496 --> 00:09:05,886
a sister.

269
00:09:06,426 --> 00:09:07,996
That was cool.

270
00:09:07,996 --> 00:09:09,136
I'm good with that, they call me

271
00:09:09,136 --> 00:09:10,976
the baby, the broken baby.

272
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:12,716
That's what I was with the

273
00:09:12,716 --> 00:09:13,326
siblings.

274
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:18,896
And about that time, it was like

275
00:09:18,896 --> 00:09:20,796
well, what are you going to do?

276
00:09:20,796 --> 00:09:22,396
My mom made it very clear, you

277
00:09:23,426 --> 00:09:24,776
have until the age of 20.

278
00:09:24,776 --> 00:09:27,306
You have to be out of the house.

279
00:09:27,306 --> 00:09:29,316
She was going to give me two

280
00:09:29,316 --> 00:09:30,206
years of the grace.

281
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:31,476
She called it tough love.

282
00:09:31,596 --> 00:09:33,346
I either needed to be in

283
00:09:33,346 --> 00:09:35,016
college, or I needed to have a

284
00:09:35,016 --> 00:09:37,866
job, but that she didn't shoot

285
00:09:37,866 --> 00:09:38,076
me.

286
00:09:39,726 --> 00:09:40,876
I got shot.

287
00:09:40,876 --> 00:09:43,706
Some might say today that might

288
00:09:43,756 --> 00:09:46,136
be a little weird and tough.

289
00:09:46,736 --> 00:09:47,656
But it was tough love.

290
00:09:48,236 --> 00:09:49,776
And it was yes ma'am, no ma'am.

291
00:09:49,776 --> 00:09:52,666
And I thought, well what am I

292
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:53,436
going to do.

293
00:09:53,496 --> 00:09:55,636
I always wanted to be a Navy

294
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:56,106
Seal.

295
00:09:56,256 --> 00:09:57,336
I wanted to be in the Secret

296
00:09:57,336 --> 00:09:57,916
Service.

297
00:09:58,956 --> 00:09:59,716
That was the plan.

298
00:10:01,126 --> 00:10:02,686
And then my body got robbed.

299
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:05,216
So, what became the plan, well

300
00:10:05,216 --> 00:10:06,656
I'll become a psychiatrist.

301
00:10:07,196 --> 00:10:08,616
I wanted to go to med school.

302
00:10:08,616 --> 00:10:09,726
I wanted to go to Berkeley.

303
00:10:09,946 --> 00:10:14,406
And about that 15, 16 years of

304
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:16,596
age, parents sat me down, dad

305
00:10:16,596 --> 00:10:18,716
and mom and said, hey, what are

306
00:10:18,716 --> 00:10:19,586
you going to do.

307
00:10:19,586 --> 00:10:21,366
What if something like med

308
00:10:21,366 --> 00:10:22,476
school doesn't really work?

309
00:10:23,006 --> 00:10:24,496
I said, OK.

310
00:10:24,496 --> 00:10:27,026
You've got to have a marketable

311
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:27,756
skill son.

312
00:10:27,756 --> 00:10:30,766
And I thought, well I'm not sure

313
00:10:30,766 --> 00:10:31,476
what I'm going to do.

314
00:10:32,766 --> 00:10:34,116
So, in that process of just sort

315
00:10:34,116 --> 00:10:35,466
of being open and learning,

316
00:10:36,106 --> 00:10:37,196
there was this thing called the

317
00:10:37,196 --> 00:10:37,806
internet.

318
00:10:37,806 --> 00:10:40,576
This was the mid-nineties.

319
00:10:40,646 --> 00:10:42,576
And there was just over 100,000

320
00:10:42,576 --> 00:10:43,316
websites.

321
00:10:43,826 --> 00:10:46,326
And I begin to go to school

322
00:10:46,986 --> 00:10:48,486
outside of my normal high school

323
00:10:48,486 --> 00:10:49,016
process.

324
00:10:49,016 --> 00:10:50,216
Actually, had to move away,

325
00:10:50,696 --> 00:10:52,596
about 2.5 hours away from my

326
00:10:52,596 --> 00:10:53,106
parents.

327
00:10:53,886 --> 00:10:55,806
I had to become emancipated from

328
00:10:55,806 --> 00:10:57,876
my parents as well, just because

329
00:10:57,876 --> 00:10:58,946
the way some of these rules

330
00:10:58,946 --> 00:10:59,266
work.

331
00:10:59,426 --> 00:11:02,156
And I began to go to college and

332
00:10:59,426 --> 00:11:02,156
And I began to go to college and

333
00:11:02,156 --> 00:11:03,486
high school at the same time.

334
00:11:04,056 --> 00:11:06,556
And at the age of 17 years old,

335
00:11:06,556 --> 00:11:07,866
I was done with my associates,

336
00:11:08,356 --> 00:11:10,826
learned software development,

337
00:11:11,236 --> 00:11:12,026
specifically in the

338
00:11:12,026 --> 00:11:13,286
client/server platform

339
00:11:13,286 --> 00:11:13,926
relationship.

340
00:11:14,476 --> 00:11:17,276
And after that it was, well, but

341
00:11:18,346 --> 00:11:19,226
I want to go to Berkeley.

342
00:11:21,326 --> 00:11:22,736
Well, just go get your GED and

343
00:11:22,736 --> 00:11:24,616
then maybe you can make it

344
00:11:24,616 --> 00:11:25,226
happen for you.

345
00:11:26,066 --> 00:11:28,076
Berkeley's not going to accept a

346
00:11:28,076 --> 00:11:28,206
GED.

347
00:11:29,206 --> 00:11:30,696
Well, you got to get a diploma.

348
00:11:31,696 --> 00:11:34,556
I got to go back to high school?

349
00:11:34,556 --> 00:11:36,306
So, I ended up actually doing

350
00:11:36,306 --> 00:11:36,426
that.

351
00:11:36,426 --> 00:11:37,076
I don't even know the high

352
00:11:37,076 --> 00:11:38,266
school I graduated from.

353
00:11:38,266 --> 00:11:40,156
I know its location Renton,

354
00:11:40,156 --> 00:11:40,746
Washington.

355
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:42,346
But I actually never stepped

356
00:11:42,346 --> 00:11:43,066
foot in that school.

357
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:45,826
So, I graduated high school

358
00:11:45,826 --> 00:11:46,776
actually after I graduated

359
00:11:46,776 --> 00:11:47,256
college.

360
00:11:48,326 --> 00:11:50,686
Exactly. Completely jacked up,

361
00:11:50,686 --> 00:11:51,016
right.

362
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:53,846
My degree wasn't even valid

363
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:57,656
until high school was over with.

364
00:11:57,806 --> 00:12:01,486
So, I did that and during that

365
00:11:57,806 --> 00:12:01,486
So, I did that and during that

366
00:12:01,486 --> 00:12:03,306
process did I find, wow.

367
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:05,346
I sort of like software.

368
00:12:06,716 --> 00:12:08,196
I like this process.

369
00:12:08,706 --> 00:12:09,986
This is really interesting.

370
00:12:11,306 --> 00:12:12,656
So, then began the process of

371
00:12:12,656 --> 00:12:13,646
well, get a job.

372
00:12:14,896 --> 00:12:16,286
I'm 17 years old.

373
00:12:17,466 --> 00:12:19,306
What do I know as a 17-year-old?

374
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:21,696
Plus, I'm a C4 quadriplegic.

375
00:12:22,246 --> 00:12:23,786
Who was going to hire a dude in

376
00:12:23,786 --> 00:12:24,286
a chair?

377
00:12:25,626 --> 00:12:27,156
Again, just, you know you look

378
00:12:27,156 --> 00:12:28,736
back and you sort of laugh.

379
00:12:28,736 --> 00:12:32,646
173 resumes sent.

380
00:12:33,326 --> 00:12:35,086
Every single tech job in the

381
00:12:35,086 --> 00:12:35,886
Seattle PI.

382
00:12:36,176 --> 00:12:39,916
I did a dozen interviews or

383
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:41,126
more, I can't remember now.

384
00:12:41,126 --> 00:12:43,686
But they all ended with, you're

385
00:12:44,086 --> 00:12:45,066
just not the right fit.

386
00:12:45,066 --> 00:12:49,066
You're just not the right fit.

387
00:12:49,266 --> 00:12:51,796
One was, you just don't have the

388
00:12:51,796 --> 00:12:53,996
sort of the office skills that

389
00:12:53,996 --> 00:12:56,016
we need.

390
00:12:56,236 --> 00:12:57,406
Yeah, you got that right, you

391
00:12:58,006 --> 00:12:59,666
know I can't staple worth crap

392
00:12:59,666 --> 00:12:59,966
you know?

393
00:13:00,526 --> 00:13:01,976
I can't even pick up a damn

394
00:13:02,496 --> 00:13:04,766
phone. But OK.

395
00:13:05,066 --> 00:13:09,436
And I won't mention the name of

396
00:13:09,926 --> 00:13:11,976
that company.

397
00:13:12,046 --> 00:13:13,386
Then it was like, how am I going

398
00:13:13,386 --> 00:13:14,526
to get a job?

399
00:13:16,116 --> 00:13:18,806
And I remember sending a fax

400
00:13:19,546 --> 00:13:20,386
through my computer.

401
00:13:20,386 --> 00:13:24,026
And the modem connected at 14.4

402
00:13:24,026 --> 00:13:24,526
bod [phonic].

403
00:13:25,456 --> 00:13:26,776
And I went, oh, yeah.

404
00:13:28,836 --> 00:13:30,196
This place is legit.

405
00:13:30,566 --> 00:13:33,496
I sent my res, and my cove.

406
00:13:33,496 --> 00:13:34,896
And I got hired.

407
00:13:35,136 --> 00:13:37,476
This big old dude, he's 6' 7".

408
00:13:37,476 --> 00:13:39,256
He's huge, named Steven.

409
00:13:40,316 --> 00:13:41,776
My attendant knocks on the door,

410
00:13:41,776 --> 00:13:42,546
opens the door.

411
00:13:43,006 --> 00:13:43,906
He looks down at me.

412
00:13:44,126 --> 00:13:46,106
I'm, I'm here to apply for the

413
00:13:46,106 --> 00:13:47,256
software develop job.

414
00:13:47,756 --> 00:13:48,616
He's like yeah come on in.

415
00:13:48,616 --> 00:13:50,596
He had to move his office all

416
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:52,716
around so I could fit in his

417
00:13:53,736 --> 00:13:53,876
office.

418
00:13:54,096 --> 00:13:55,996
And he goes, how did you get

419
00:13:55,996 --> 00:13:56,816
paralyzed.

420
00:13:57,986 --> 00:13:59,386
Man, I think that's; you're not

421
00:13:59,386 --> 00:14:00,286
supposed to say that [laughter].

422
00:13:59,386 --> 00:14:00,286
supposed to say that [laughter].

423
00:14:01,396 --> 00:14:03,036
That's the one rule they told me

424
00:14:03,036 --> 00:14:03,776
they wouldn't do.

425
00:14:03,826 --> 00:14:06,646
That's the first, the core first

426
00:14:06,646 --> 00:14:07,186
question.

427
00:14:08,856 --> 00:14:11,006
Second question, how much money

428
00:14:11,006 --> 00:14:11,446
you want?

429
00:14:11,906 --> 00:14:14,206
Well, they told me I could make

430
00:14:14,206 --> 00:14:15,456
50 grand coming out of the

431
00:14:15,456 --> 00:14:15,926
school.

432
00:14:15,926 --> 00:14:16,946
No, you ain't going to make that

433
00:14:16,946 --> 00:14:17,286
here.

434
00:14:17,906 --> 00:14:19,976
Well, what do you want?

435
00:14:19,976 --> 00:14:21,706
How about 25?

436
00:14:22,176 --> 00:14:23,166
OK, sounds good.

437
00:14:23,326 --> 00:14:26,646
I think I was 18 for about five

438
00:14:26,676 --> 00:14:27,146
days.

439
00:14:27,146 --> 00:14:30,566
I had no idea what I was doing.

440
00:14:30,566 --> 00:14:31,916
Two days later got my job.

441
00:14:32,686 --> 00:14:35,226
So, I'm 18 years old.

442
00:14:35,636 --> 00:14:37,306
I'm working as a software

443
00:14:37,306 --> 00:14:39,146
developer for a medical company.

444
00:14:39,816 --> 00:14:41,136
Serving in the industry called

445
00:14:41,136 --> 00:14:41,866
pathology.

446
00:14:43,406 --> 00:14:45,706
Think of blood, think of sputum,

447
00:14:45,706 --> 00:14:47,886
think of autopsies, right?

448
00:14:47,886 --> 00:14:49,176
Things removed from the body.

449
00:14:49,716 --> 00:14:51,946
And I begin my career as a

450
00:14:51,946 --> 00:14:52,836
software developer.

451
00:14:55,796 --> 00:14:57,736
About a year later, maybe 2

452
00:14:57,736 --> 00:15:01,596
years later something profound

453
00:14:57,736 --> 00:15:01,596
years later something profound

454
00:15:01,596 --> 00:15:02,016
hit me.

455
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:05,136
I'm wanted.

456
00:15:07,856 --> 00:15:09,116
I'm valued.

457
00:15:09,506 --> 00:15:12,576
I have purpose.

458
00:15:14,056 --> 00:15:15,196
Now, I can only speak of my

459
00:15:15,196 --> 00:15:16,696
story folks, but man you give a

460
00:15:16,696 --> 00:15:18,176
man respect and you give man

461
00:15:18,206 --> 00:15:20,316
purpose, that man is going to

462
00:15:20,496 --> 00:15:20,656
do.

463
00:15:20,876 --> 00:15:25,956
And he's going to do it right.

464
00:15:26,056 --> 00:15:28,906
At that same time, as always,

465
00:15:30,196 --> 00:15:31,406
did the government come by and

466
00:15:31,406 --> 00:15:34,146
say hey, Todd, no more Social

467
00:15:34,146 --> 00:15:35,146
Services for you.

468
00:15:35,676 --> 00:15:38,696
And I'm like well, yeah but I've

469
00:15:38,696 --> 00:15:40,966
got to; you've got a job.

470
00:15:41,436 --> 00:15:43,356
Yeah, but I'm not like, I've

471
00:15:43,356 --> 00:15:44,866
still got a lot to go.

472
00:15:45,006 --> 00:15:45,916
No, you're done.

473
00:15:46,126 --> 00:15:47,056
You either got a job or you

474
00:15:47,056 --> 00:15:47,366
don't.

475
00:15:47,516 --> 00:15:50,346
So, they pulled the funds.

476
00:15:50,806 --> 00:15:53,366
I had to go to my boss and say

477
00:15:53,366 --> 00:15:54,396
man I've got to make a lot more

478
00:15:54,396 --> 00:15:55,436
than 25K.

479
00:15:56,656 --> 00:15:58,216
He said, no problem.

480
00:15:59,796 --> 00:15:59,906
Done.

481
00:16:00,096 --> 00:16:03,186
What? Why couldn't we do this

482
00:16:03,366 --> 00:16:04,606
two years ago [laughter]?

483
00:16:04,606 --> 00:16:09,976
Later he told me he took

484
00:16:10,106 --> 00:16:14,176
advantage of me because of my

485
00:16:14,176 --> 00:16:15,476
disability [laughter].

486
00:16:15,476 --> 00:16:16,706
Ain't that tight.

487
00:16:16,866 --> 00:16:19,746
Man, way to go Steve.

488
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:21,106
Mad respect.

489
00:16:21,106 --> 00:16:22,296
I learned a ton from that dude.

490
00:16:22,486 --> 00:16:24,836
I worked for that company for

491
00:16:24,836 --> 00:16:25,386
years.

492
00:16:25,906 --> 00:16:30,586
And I loved every minute of it.

493
00:16:30,846 --> 00:16:33,086
I worked 24 hours a day, 7 days

494
00:16:33,086 --> 00:16:33,556
a week.

495
00:16:35,236 --> 00:16:37,316
I was mad sipping and puffing on

496
00:16:37,316 --> 00:16:37,976
that software.

497
00:16:39,046 --> 00:16:40,336
Just hitting it hard.

498
00:16:41,506 --> 00:16:42,986
Fell in love with databases.

499
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:45,706
Every aspect of the Microsoft

500
00:16:45,706 --> 00:16:46,416
SQL database.

501
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:47,686
Hope I can say Microsoft.

502
00:16:47,686 --> 00:16:48,476
I just did.

503
00:16:50,076 --> 00:16:52,596
Legit. Hardware, software the

504
00:16:52,596 --> 00:16:54,506
marriage of ray to rays.

505
00:16:55,696 --> 00:16:57,756
Straight up hard core nerd.

506
00:17:00,456 --> 00:17:02,806
But, I don't know after about 15

507
00:17:02,806 --> 00:17:05,175
years, you tend to get the, I

508
00:17:05,175 --> 00:17:07,935
want to be an employer, I'm an

509
00:17:07,935 --> 00:17:08,786
entrepreneur.

510
00:17:08,786 --> 00:17:09,976
I don't know if I want to be

511
00:17:09,976 --> 00:17:11,106
that employee anymore.

512
00:17:13,136 --> 00:17:14,955
One thing leads to another and

513
00:17:15,965 --> 00:17:17,626
it looks like I'm about to make

514
00:17:17,626 --> 00:17:18,326
my exit.

515
00:17:18,846 --> 00:17:21,106
And this really, really cool

516
00:17:21,106 --> 00:17:24,465
lady named Judith, my lateral,

517
00:17:26,195 --> 00:17:32,266
diagnosed with stage IV.

518
00:17:32,466 --> 00:17:33,586
Move from the chest to the

519
00:17:33,586 --> 00:17:34,276
brain.

520
00:17:34,746 --> 00:17:38,366
A few months before she exited

521
00:17:38,366 --> 00:17:43,116
her earth suit, she told me I

522
00:17:43,826 --> 00:17:45,936
had to bounce.

523
00:17:46,046 --> 00:17:47,296
You better leave that job, T.

524
00:17:48,676 --> 00:17:49,676
You were made for something

525
00:17:49,676 --> 00:17:50,096
different.

526
00:17:55,956 --> 00:17:59,806
So, she died.

527
00:18:00,046 --> 00:18:00,606
And I quit.

528
00:18:01,096 --> 00:18:03,286
And I did the one thing my

529
00:18:03,286 --> 00:18:04,846
parents never told me, they

530
00:18:04,846 --> 00:18:07,086
never said to do you quit a job

531
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,116
before you got another job,

532
00:18:08,116 --> 00:18:08,876
you've got a problem.

533
00:18:09,446 --> 00:18:12,156
And I straight up did.

534
00:18:12,356 --> 00:18:15,346
What am I going to do now?

535
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:18,936
No problem, we'll be a comedian.

536
00:18:19,546 --> 00:18:21,446
I'm going to write books, I'm

537
00:18:21,446 --> 00:18:23,526
going to blog.

538
00:18:23,696 --> 00:18:24,596
T, you better not do

539
00:18:24,596 --> 00:18:25,476
punctuation.

540
00:18:25,476 --> 00:18:28,036
I'm doing a good day if I

541
00:18:28,036 --> 00:18:29,176
putting a full sentence together

542
00:18:29,176 --> 00:18:29,616
folks.

543
00:18:30,156 --> 00:18:32,226
And I don't think my jokes are

544
00:18:32,226 --> 00:18:32,746
too funny.

545
00:18:34,236 --> 00:18:35,476
So, I made this business called

546
00:18:35,506 --> 00:18:37,296
C4 consulting to make fun of my

547
00:18:37,296 --> 00:18:38,006
disability.

548
00:18:38,946 --> 00:18:39,956
I'm like ha ha.

549
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:42,896
I can do this.

550
00:18:43,676 --> 00:18:45,586
Come to find out, that's not so

551
00:18:45,586 --> 00:18:46,096
marketable.

552
00:18:46,096 --> 00:18:49,676
Someone said to me, what's your

553
00:18:49,676 --> 00:18:51,006
marketable skill, bro.

554
00:18:51,566 --> 00:18:53,386
What you going to do for a job?

555
00:18:53,386 --> 00:18:54,426
You all got to put groceries on

556
00:18:54,426 --> 00:18:54,896
the table.

557
00:18:54,896 --> 00:18:55,916
You know how it is.

558
00:18:56,096 --> 00:18:57,356
I love databases.

559
00:18:57,356 --> 00:19:00,076
Well, go be a DBA.

560
00:18:57,356 --> 00:19:00,076
Well, go be a DBA.

561
00:19:00,196 --> 00:19:00,906
All right cool.

562
00:19:01,986 --> 00:19:04,336
So, C4 consulting became a DBA

563
00:19:04,336 --> 00:19:06,446
service, subscription model.

564
00:19:06,446 --> 00:19:09,886
Rent, pure play 24/7, I'll be

565
00:19:09,886 --> 00:19:11,436
your DBA to the end.

566
00:19:12,066 --> 00:19:14,726
What's the name of your company?

567
00:19:15,146 --> 00:19:17,866
C4. Wait a minute T, you going

568
00:19:17,866 --> 00:19:20,736
to be a DBA but your company is

569
00:19:20,896 --> 00:19:21,186
called C4?

570
00:19:21,186 --> 00:19:22,356
That's an explosive [laughter].

571
00:19:24,996 --> 00:19:26,526
Yeah, that cool?

572
00:19:26,526 --> 00:19:27,806
You want to hire me?

573
00:19:28,056 --> 00:19:30,646
I hope I don't blow it up.

574
00:19:31,306 --> 00:19:32,426
And they did.

575
00:19:36,536 --> 00:19:38,726
About that same time did I need

576
00:19:39,376 --> 00:19:41,206
to go a wedding.

577
00:19:47,136 --> 00:19:48,736
And I asked one of my staff, I

578
00:19:48,736 --> 00:19:49,806
said I don't want to go to this

579
00:19:49,806 --> 00:19:52,036
wedding, I'm crying like a baby

580
00:19:52,036 --> 00:19:53,246
right now because it's real.

581
00:19:54,266 --> 00:19:55,956
And she says to me, well who do

582
00:19:55,956 --> 00:19:57,376
you want to go with?

583
00:19:57,376 --> 00:19:59,086
I don't want to take an

584
00:19:59,086 --> 00:19:59,756
employee.

585
00:20:00,016 --> 00:20:02,166
I don't want to take a family

586
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:02,556
member.

587
00:20:03,336 --> 00:20:06,136
I want to take a woman, and if

588
00:20:06,136 --> 00:20:07,446
she's hot that'd be great.

589
00:20:09,446 --> 00:20:10,256
You know Karen?

590
00:20:10,746 --> 00:20:11,426
Who's Karen?

591
00:20:11,946 --> 00:20:14,546
Then I met Karen.

592
00:20:15,036 --> 00:20:20,266
And I fell in love with her the

593
00:20:20,516 --> 00:20:22,176
moment I met her.

594
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,706
And what was cool was she did

595
00:20:25,746 --> 00:20:26,116
the same.

596
00:20:26,626 --> 00:20:29,646
And we went to that wedding and

597
00:20:30,366 --> 00:20:32,216
it was like we were the only two

598
00:20:34,256 --> 00:20:34,356
there.

599
00:20:34,576 --> 00:20:35,986
She got up to go get second

600
00:20:35,986 --> 00:20:37,696
rounds on bread and food.

601
00:20:38,836 --> 00:20:40,226
This strange lady leans over and

602
00:20:40,226 --> 00:20:42,866
says, hey, she's laughing at all

603
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:43,736
your jokes.

604
00:20:43,736 --> 00:20:46,396
I said, is that a good sign?

605
00:20:46,776 --> 00:20:48,096
She said, yeah [laugther].

606
00:20:49,966 --> 00:20:51,586
Your jokes aren't so good

607
00:20:51,586 --> 00:20:53,016

So, Karen comes back and I'm

615
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:12,036
blown away, she got some bread,

616
00:21:12,626 --> 00:21:15,066
she got some wine, and there was

617
00:21:15,066 --> 00:21:16,606
more butter on the piece of

618
00:21:16,606 --> 00:21:17,786

620

right now, I'm all about that

621
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:21,906
butter.

622
00:21:22,386 --> 00:21:25,496
And I was like oh, I've got to

623
00:21:25,496 --> 00:21:26,126
get this one.

624
00:21:26,686 --> 00:21:28,916
A couple months later she says

625
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:30,046
something like this, when you

626
00:21:30,046 --> 00:21:33,486
ask it will be a yes.

627
00:21:33,676 --> 00:21:36,396
What? Does that mean?

628
00:21:36,466 --> 00:21:37,966
I got to grow up.

629
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:41,126
And I married Karen.

630
00:21:42,596 --> 00:21:44,786
Karen Lynn Regal.

631
00:21:46,816 --> 00:21:48,436
She became Karen Lynn

632
00:21:48,436 --> 00:21:49,206
Stabelfeldt.

633
00:21:52,206 --> 00:21:55,146
And about that same time, I saw

634
00:21:55,146 --> 00:21:56,976
my boy, Samuel Jackson on a

635
00:21:56,976 --> 00:21:57,566

636
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:59,916
He says something like, 'Siri,

637
00:22:00,816 --> 00:22:02,696
find me a recipe for gazpacho

638
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:03,016
soup.

639
00:22:03,566 --> 00:22:06,376
I was like, what's gazpacho

640
00:22:06,376 --> 00:22:06,926
soup?

641
00:22:07,206 --> 00:22:11,246
And I tasted it, what a horrible

642
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:12,146
choice for soup [laughter].

643
00:22:15,046 --> 00:22:16,186
Who would want that.

644
00:22:16,856 --> 00:22:19,236
I was like, I said I can use

645
00:22:19,236 --> 00:22:19,816
that phone.

646
00:22:19,816 --> 00:22:22,036
And the button.

647
00:22:22,036 --> 00:22:24,376
Well I can't press the button.

648
00:22:25,036 --> 00:22:26,356
I can tell you all right now, I

649
00:22:26,356 --> 00:22:28,026
tried hacking and rewiring that

650
00:22:28,026 --> 00:22:28,856
headset thing.

651
00:22:28,856 --> 00:22:30,196
That just didn't work.

652
00:22:30,706 --> 00:22:33,846
A few months later, I'm at a

653
00:22:33,846 --> 00:22:34,976
quad squad meeting.

654
00:22:36,116 --> 00:22:39,226
Yes, it's a meeting with quads.

655
00:22:39,666 --> 00:22:40,816
We're a squad.

656
00:22:41,756 --> 00:22:44,046
And by day we're horribly

657
00:22:44,046 --> 00:22:46,416
disabled, and by night, we're

658
00:22:46,416 --> 00:22:48,586
still horribly disabled.

659
00:22:49,556 --> 00:22:51,346
But we do fantasize about

660
00:22:51,346 --> 00:22:52,156

661
00:22:52,636 --> 00:22:56,586
My boy Cody, he goes well check

662
00:22:56,586 --> 00:22:58,106
this out, he turns his head and

663
00:22:58,766 --> 00:23:00,226
his iPad does this and he turns

664
00:22:58,766 --> 00:23:00,226
his iPad does this and he turns

665
00:23:00,226 --> 00:23:00,986
his head the other way, did

666
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:01,896
something else.

667
00:23:02,286 --> 00:23:03,676
What's that?

668
00:23:04,506 --> 00:23:05,596
It's called switch control.

669
00:23:07,016 --> 00:23:08,286
Switch control?

670
00:23:09,316 --> 00:23:09,926
What's that?

671
00:23:09,986 --> 00:23:11,246
Don't know but I can do this

672
00:23:11,246 --> 00:23:11,996
with my face.

673
00:23:12,256 --> 00:23:14,076
And that's cool.

674
00:23:14,076 --> 00:23:14,996
I said what's external?

675
00:23:14,996 --> 00:23:16,236
I have no idea.

676
00:23:16,236 --> 00:23:19,566
A few weeks later,

677
00:23:21,206 --> 00:23:26,686
I'm with another friend and his

678
00:23:26,686 --> 00:23:26,976
mom goes

679
00:23:27,046 --> 00:23:28,636
you hear about that TechLa?

680
00:23:28,636 --> 00:23:29,976
I said, TechLa?

681
00:23:30,336 --> 00:23:30,966
TechLa's crap.

682
00:23:30,966 --> 00:23:32,396
And she said, no the new one.

683
00:23:33,056 --> 00:23:33,956
I said, oh what's the new one

684
00:23:33,956 --> 00:23:34,056
do?

685
00:23:34,056 --> 00:23:34,786
She said it works with a thing

686
00:23:34,786 --> 00:23:35,506
called switch control.

687
00:23:36,036 --> 00:23:38,646
And I'm like huh.

688
00:23:39,746 --> 00:23:43,006
TechLa, iPhone, external.

689
00:23:43,566 --> 00:23:44,696
Let's try it.

690
00:23:44,696 --> 00:23:47,436
So, I went out and bought some

691
00:23:47,436 --> 00:23:48,586
things, we hooked to together.

692
00:23:48,586 --> 00:23:49,646

696
00:23:53,736 --> 00:23:54,936
flipping switches and doing what

697

nots.

698
00:23:56,606 --> 00:23:57,416
And I text her.

699
00:23:59,696 --> 00:24:01,456
I'm like man, I'm done with the

700
00:23:59,696 --> 00:24:01,456
I'm like man, I'm done with the

702
00:24:03,386 --> 00:24:06,346
That Blackberry had voice signal

703
00:24:06,346 --> 00:24:06,596
on it.

704
00:24:06,596 --> 00:24:07,856
I could do like three things.

705
00:24:08,446 --> 00:24:10,516
Check my signal strength, okay

706
00:24:10,516 --> 00:24:11,336
it's still bad [laugther].

707
00:24:11,336 --> 00:24:16,346

We got three dogs, two cats.

718
00:24:35,666 --> 00:24:37,406
I just got this little business

719

called Start Up, might not even

720
00:24:38,736 --> 00:24:39,806
be named right.

721
00:24:40,526 --> 00:24:41,656

722
00:24:41,656 --> 00:24:42,516
people, it's what you do.

723
00:24:42,516 --> 00:24:44,406
And I'm like, oh, and then I

724
00:24:44,406 --> 00:24:45,156
went OK.

725
00:24:45,156 --> 00:24:46,186
Because every good husband

726
00:24:46,186 --> 00:24:48,756
listens to his wife.

727
00:24:48,756 --> 00:24:49,886

And we got to make that video,

732

I've always been, you know an

00:26:06,626 --> 00:26:07,996
outdoors person, and I find that

761
00:26:07,996 --> 00:26:10,496
I really regain my energy from

762
00:26:10,496 --> 00:26:11,026
being out here.

can leave the house and be gone

00:30:47,726 --> 00:30:48,736

It should just be a part of it.

1135
00:40:49,016 --> 00:40:50,916
If you could interact with Siri

1136
00:40:51,906 --> 00:40:53,286
in your app, then do so.

1137
00:40:53,286 --> 00:40:55,846
Because it is quicker.

1138
00:40:56,346 --> 00:40:59,446
And the last thing I would say

1139
00:40:59,446 --> 00:41:03,906
is have somebody test it

1140
00:40:59,446 --> 00:41:03,906
is have somebody test it

1141
00:41:03,906 --> 00:41:03,973
[laugther].

1142
00:41:03,973 --> 00:41:08,806
And if that person happens to be

1143
00:41:08,806 --> 00:41:10,366
disabled, then real cool because

1144
00:41:10,366 --> 00:41:11,366
you know it's legit.

1145
00:41:11,366 --> 00:41:14,316
It's boots on the ground, right?

1146
00:41:14,436 --> 00:41:15,856
Speech rec for the quad by the

1147
00:41:15,856 --> 00:41:17,256
quad is what?

1148
00:41:17,256 --> 00:41:19,296
Speech rec for the whole world.

1149
00:41:20,016 --> 00:41:22,376
Because it's not convenience for

1150
00:41:22,376 --> 00:41:23,416
us, it's independence.

1151
00:41:23,896 --> 00:41:27,046
I'm Todd and I love you and

1152
00:41:27,046 --> 00:41:27,976
thank you so much.
