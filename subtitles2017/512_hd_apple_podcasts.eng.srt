31
00:01:07,986 --> 00:01:10,856
But first, we want to talk for a

32
00:01:10,856 --> 00:01:12,686
moment about how we think about

33
00:01:12,686 --> 00:01:16,146
modern podcasts, long form and

34
00:01:16,146 --> 00:01:16,656
audio.

35
00:01:17,286 --> 00:01:19,756
We get excited about episodic

36
00:01:19,756 --> 00:01:21,636
content that entertains,

37
00:01:21,766 --> 00:01:23,676

too.

41
00:01:28,366 --> 00:01:32,036
In 2016 alone, we served up over

42
00:01:32,136 --> 00:01:34,786
10 billion episode downloads and

43
00:01:34,786 --> 00:01:37,246
streaming plays across iOS,

44
00:01:37,766 --> 00:01:39,196
macOS and tvOS.

45
00:01:39,776 --> 00:01:42,976
That's up from 8 billion in 2015

46
00:01:42,976 --> 00:01:45,906
and just under 7 billion in 2014

47
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:47,956
when Podcasts app became

48
00:01:48,206 --> 00:01:49,886
preinstalled for the first time

49
00:01:49,886 --> 00:01:50,656

58
00:02:09,616 --> 00:02:10,846

00:06:18,826 --> 00:06:20,116
It's also really easy to get to

195
00:06:20,116 --> 00:06:21,716
your recently added podcasts.

196
00:06:23,066 --> 00:06:24,166
Let's dive into one of those

197
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:25,536
podcasts.

198
00:06:26,216 --> 00:06:27,346
Here, I can view all the

199
00:06:27,346 --> 00:06:28,756
episodes from the show that I

200
00:06:28,756 --> 00:06:29,486
need to listen to.

201
00:06:30,786 --> 00:06:32,206
It's really easy to pick up

202
00:06:32,206 --> 00:06:33,466
where I left off with Continue

203
00:06:33,466 --> 00:06:35,636
Listening, and from this page, I

204
00:06:35,636 --> 00:06:37,186
can also view the top episodes

205
00:06:38,286 --> 00:06:39,276
or scroll down and view all

206
00:06:39,276 --> 00:06:40,246
available episodes.

207
00:06:40,776 --> 00:06:44,526
Here's one of those individual

208
00:06:44,526 --> 00:06:45,016
episodes.

209
00:06:45,496 --> 00:06:46,726
Here, I see the expanded show

210
00:06:46,726 --> 00:06:49,396
notes, and I can see exactly how

211
00:06:49,396 --> 00:06:51,226
much of this episode I have left

212
00:06:51,226 --> 00:06:51,756
to listen to.

213
00:06:55,216 --> 00:06:56,916
Next up, we have Browse.

214
00:06:57,196 --> 00:06:58,796
This will be very familiar if

215
00:06:58,796 --> 00:07:00,546
you've used the Music app.

216
00:06:58,796 --> 00:07:00,546
you've used the Music app.

217
00:07:01,936 --> 00:07:03,536
We'll dive into Featured first.

218
00:07:04,526 --> 00:07:05,836
Each week our editors to scour

219
00:07:05,836 --> 00:07:06,716
all the latest shows and

220
00:07:06,716 --> 00:07:08,076
episodes to bring you the best

221
00:07:08,076 --> 00:07:08,436
of what's new.

222
00:07:11,436 --> 00:07:12,906
We can also look at Top Charts.

223
00:07:13,426 --> 00:07:14,226
Here, we have all the top

224
00:07:14,226 --> 00:07:15,436
episodes and shows that are

225
00:07:15,436 --> 00:07:17,586
trending right now, and I can

226
00:07:17,586 --> 00:07:19,336
also browse featured providers

227
00:07:19,376 --> 00:07:20,476
or dive deeper into my favorite

228
00:07:20,476 --> 00:07:20,976
categories.

229
00:07:24,656 --> 00:07:26,056
And finally, we have Search.

230
00:07:27,126 --> 00:07:28,756
Here, you can quickly find any

231
00:07:28,756 --> 00:07:30,186
new show or episode in the Apple

232
00:07:30,186 --> 00:07:32,256
Podcasts catalog or just scope

233
00:07:32,256 --> 00:07:33,516
that search to your own library.

234
00:07:34,836 --> 00:07:36,216
That's a quick overview of the

235
00:07:36,256 --> 00:07:37,666
Podcasts updates in iOS 11.

236
00:07:38,286 --> 00:07:39,726
This is our biggest updates to

237
00:07:39,726 --> 00:07:41,046
the Podcasts apps since we first

238
00:07:41,046 --> 00:07:41,626
launched in iOS.

239
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:43,666
We hope you get a chance to

240
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:44,596
check it out in the iOS

241
00:07:44,596 --> 00:07:45,826
developer preview and give us

242
00:07:45,826 --> 00:07:46,196
your feedback.

243
00:07:47,756 --> 00:07:48,806
Next up, I'd like to bring Garth

244
00:07:48,806 --> 00:07:49,656
Jantzen up to the stage.

245
00:07:49,656 --> 00:07:50,686
He's going to give you an

246
00:07:50,686 --> 00:07:52,136
overview of the updates we're

247
00:07:52,136 --> 00:07:53,306
making to the Apple Podcasts

248
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:54,686
Spec to support some of these

249
00:07:54,686 --> 00:07:55,976
great new features in iOS 11.

250
00:07:58,516 --> 00:08:03,036
[ Applause ]

251
00:07:58,516 --> 00:08:03,036
[ Applause ]

252
00:08:03,536 --> 00:08:03,926
&gt;&gt; Thanks, DJ.

253
00:08:03,926 --> 00:08:06,346
Great to see you all here today.

254
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:08,886
So, today, we are excited to

255
00:08:08,886 --> 00:08:10,116
talk about some updates we're

256
00:08:10,116 --> 00:08:11,916
bringing to the Apple Podcasts

257
00:08:11,986 --> 00:08:13,746
Feed Spec. These updates will

258
00:08:13,746 --> 00:08:15,826
help podcast creators to take

259
00:08:15,826 --> 00:08:17,486
full advantage of the redesigned

260
00:08:17,586 --> 00:08:19,246
Apple Podcasts app in iOS 11

261
00:08:19,246 --> 00:08:20,756
that you just saw, while also

262
00:08:20,756 --> 00:08:22,286
making it easier for listeners

263
00:08:22,286 --> 00:08:23,996
to discover and engage that

264
00:08:23,996 --> 00:08:24,446
content.

265
00:08:25,016 --> 00:08:26,576
So, to provide some context, I'd

266
00:08:26,576 --> 00:08:28,146
like to start with an example of

267
00:08:28,146 --> 00:08:30,046
what you might see today in iOS

268
00:08:30,186 --> 00:08:31,396
10 when you subscribe to a new

269
00:08:31,396 --> 00:08:32,066
podcast.

270
00:08:33,476 --> 00:08:34,446
So, when you subscribe to a

271
00:08:34,446 --> 00:08:36,206
podcast, we automatically put

272
00:08:36,206 --> 00:08:37,785
the latest episode into your

273
00:08:37,785 --> 00:08:39,416
unplayed episode list, which is

274
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:40,996
great for most podcasts.

275
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:42,726
But in the case of this example,

276
00:08:42,726 --> 00:08:43,676
there's a couple of problems.

277
00:08:44,466 --> 00:08:45,916
First, as you can see, this is

278
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:47,866
Episode 4 of what looks to be

279
00:08:48,016 --> 00:08:48,676
Season 2.

280
00:08:49,246 --> 00:08:51,036
So, in the case of this podcast,

281
00:08:51,036 --> 00:08:52,106
it's actually intended to start

282
00:08:52,106 --> 00:08:53,666
from the beginning with Episode

283
00:08:53,756 --> 00:08:54,996
1 of Season 2.

284
00:08:55,656 --> 00:08:56,846
Also, it required that the

285
00:08:56,846 --> 00:08:58,206
podcast author put both the

286
00:08:58,206 --> 00:09:00,036
season number and the episode

287
00:08:58,206 --> 00:09:00,036
season number and the episode

288
00:09:00,036 --> 00:09:01,336
number in front of the title,

289
00:09:01,336 --> 00:09:02,216
which isn't the best user

290
00:09:02,216 --> 00:09:02,926
experience.

291
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:05,246
So, going over to the feed tab

292
00:09:05,426 --> 00:09:06,896
when I look for Episode 1, 2,

293
00:09:06,896 --> 00:09:08,386
and 3, I find that they're in

294
00:09:08,386 --> 00:09:09,426
the wrong order, and it's

295
00:09:09,426 --> 00:09:10,926
difficult to add those episodes

296
00:09:10,986 --> 00:09:12,446
over to my unplayed list so I

297
00:09:12,446 --> 00:09:13,706
can start from the beginning and

298
00:09:13,706 --> 00:09:15,276
listen through in the correct

299
00:09:15,276 --> 00:09:15,546
order.

300
00:09:16,206 --> 00:09:18,126
So, all I can say is that we

301
00:09:18,126 --> 00:09:19,046
think we can do better here.

302
00:09:19,236 --> 00:09:21,156
So, to start, we're happy to

303
00:09:21,156 --> 00:09:22,426
announce support for podcast

304
00:09:22,426 --> 00:09:24,216
seasons in iOS 11.

305
00:09:25,206 --> 00:09:26,176
So, seasons will allow

306
00:09:26,176 --> 00:09:27,836
podcasters to group together

307
00:09:27,836 --> 00:09:29,646
episodes where it makes sense

308
00:09:29,886 --> 00:09:31,476
for their podcast content, and

309
00:09:31,476 --> 00:09:32,816
within a season they'll also be

310
00:09:32,816 --> 00:09:34,156
able to choose the order in

311
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:34,996
which those episodes are

312
00:09:34,996 --> 00:09:36,526
presented, whether it's newest

313
00:09:36,526 --> 00:09:38,216
to oldest, or oldest to newest.

314
00:09:38,736 --> 00:09:40,076
And utilizing the other tags

315
00:09:40,076 --> 00:09:41,336
we're about to talk about that

316
00:09:41,336 --> 00:09:43,006
we're adding, we'll be able to

317
00:09:43,006 --> 00:09:44,816
present nice season headers and

318
00:09:44,816 --> 00:09:46,736
concise titles to best present

319
00:09:47,136 --> 00:09:47,736
the content.

320
00:09:49,086 --> 00:09:50,526
New subscribers will also get

321
00:09:50,646 --> 00:09:52,366
full, the full current season

322
00:09:52,366 --> 00:09:54,076
automatically moved into their

323
00:09:54,076 --> 00:09:55,316
Library in a new section called

324
00:09:55,316 --> 00:09:56,846
My Episodes, which is going to

325
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:57,136
be great.

326
00:09:57,486 --> 00:09:58,696
We have a Quick Play action that

327
00:09:58,696 --> 00:09:59,766
will allow listeners to start

328
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:01,206
from the beginning, as intended,

329
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:01,206
from the beginning, as intended,

330
00:10:01,496 --> 00:10:02,886
or pick up right where they left

331
00:10:02,886 --> 00:10:02,976
off.

332
00:10:03,046 --> 00:10:04,996
So, now, let's look at the Spec

333
00:10:04,996 --> 00:10:06,286
and see how all this ties

334
00:10:06,346 --> 00:10:06,666
together.

335
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:10,106
So, first, we have a new tag for

336
00:10:10,106 --> 00:10:11,566
a podcast called Podcast type,

337
00:10:12,046 --> 00:10:13,836
and iOS 11, we're starting off

338
00:10:13,836 --> 00:10:16,076
with two podcast types, episodic

339
00:10:16,426 --> 00:10:17,076
and serial.

340
00:10:18,796 --> 00:10:19,786
So, first, episodic.

341
00:10:20,336 --> 00:10:21,676
This is the default podcast

342
00:10:21,676 --> 00:10:22,786
type, and the one you're used to

343
00:10:22,786 --> 00:10:24,486
seeing in Apple Podcasts today.

344
00:10:24,796 --> 00:10:25,916
This is best for standalone

345
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:27,356
episodes where listening order

346
00:10:27,356 --> 00:10:28,346
isn't super important.

347
00:10:28,986 --> 00:10:30,526
New subscribers as of today will

348
00:10:30,526 --> 00:10:32,316
receive the latest episode or

349
00:10:32,316 --> 00:10:33,666
the entire season, starting with

350
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:35,016
the latest episode, if you're

351
00:10:35,016 --> 00:10:35,786
using seasons.

352
00:10:37,506 --> 00:10:38,816
So, serialize, this is new in

353
00:10:38,816 --> 00:10:39,566
iOS 11.

354
00:10:39,566 --> 00:10:41,236
We're really excited about this.

355
00:10:41,236 --> 00:10:42,506
This is great where episodes are

356
00:10:42,506 --> 00:10:44,246
recommended from beginning, from

357
00:10:44,246 --> 00:10:45,776
oldest to newest, and it's great

358
00:10:45,776 --> 00:10:47,696
for narrative, storytelling-type

359
00:10:47,696 --> 00:10:49,156
podcasts, where it's important

360
00:10:49,156 --> 00:10:50,326
to start from the beginning of a

361
00:10:50,326 --> 00:10:51,346
season or show.

362
00:10:52,136 --> 00:10:53,486
New subscribers will receive the

363
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:54,916
first episode in their Library,

364
00:10:55,256 --> 00:10:56,756
or the entire season, starting

365
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:57,956
with the latest episode, with

366
00:10:57,956 --> 00:10:58,926
the first episode if they're

367
00:10:58,926 --> 00:10:59,636
using seasons.

368
00:11:01,676 --> 00:11:03,376
So, next is title, which is a

369
00:11:03,376 --> 00:11:04,686
new tag, and it's intended for

370
00:11:04,686 --> 00:11:06,266
just the title of the episode.

371
00:11:06,386 --> 00:11:07,556
We're asking that you leave off

372
00:11:07,746 --> 00:11:09,606
the podcast title, the episode

373
00:11:09,606 --> 00:11:11,136
number, season number, and the

374
00:11:11,136 --> 00:11:11,586
dates.

375
00:11:11,586 --> 00:11:12,736
We're going to use this

376
00:11:12,836 --> 00:11:14,006
differently, depending on the

377
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:15,476
context of your podcast type.

378
00:11:15,826 --> 00:11:16,906
So, in this screen, you can see

379
00:11:16,906 --> 00:11:17,846
that we're combining it with

380
00:11:17,846 --> 00:11:19,056
some other metadata; in this

381
00:11:19,056 --> 00:11:20,706
case, episode number, to best

382
00:11:20,706 --> 00:11:21,866
represent an episode from a

383
00:11:21,866 --> 00:11:23,346
serial podcast where episode

384
00:11:23,346 --> 00:11:24,186
number is important.

385
00:11:25,886 --> 00:11:26,806
And then, here, to best

386
00:11:26,806 --> 00:11:28,096
represent an episode from an

387
00:11:28,096 --> 00:11:30,166
episodic podcast, where episode

388
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:31,606
number isn't as important.

389
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:35,156
So, next, episode number.

390
00:11:35,156 --> 00:11:36,756
So, this is a new tag, and

391
00:11:36,756 --> 00:11:38,216
starting with your first episode

392
00:11:38,216 --> 00:11:39,656
in your podcast, every episode

393
00:11:39,656 --> 00:11:40,706
should have an incremental

394
00:11:40,706 --> 00:11:41,106
number.

395
00:11:41,496 --> 00:11:43,096
If you're using seasons, the

396
00:11:43,096 --> 00:11:43,996
episode number should be

397
00:11:43,996 --> 00:11:45,796
specific to that season.

398
00:11:47,546 --> 00:11:48,426
Then, we have season number.

399
00:11:48,896 --> 00:11:50,366
Every episode that's associated

400
00:11:50,366 --> 00:11:51,726
with a particular season should

401
00:11:51,726 --> 00:11:53,146
use the same season number.

402
00:11:53,456 --> 00:11:54,836
We'll collect all the episodes

403
00:11:54,836 --> 00:11:56,206
together and present them as

404
00:11:56,206 --> 00:11:57,506
seasons to listen to with a nice

405
00:11:57,506 --> 00:11:57,766
header.

406
00:11:58,186 --> 00:11:59,706
We'll also give precedent to

407
00:11:59,766 --> 00:12:01,586
your latest season first on your

408
00:11:59,766 --> 00:12:01,586
your latest season first on your

409
00:12:01,586 --> 00:12:02,346
podcast page.

410
00:12:03,126 --> 00:12:04,856
So, using a combination of

411
00:12:04,856 --> 00:12:06,516
episode title, episode number,

412
00:12:06,516 --> 00:12:08,076
and season number, we can choose

413
00:12:08,076 --> 00:12:09,126
how to best represent that

414
00:12:09,126 --> 00:12:10,316
content in different parts of

415
00:12:10,316 --> 00:12:11,296
the app, as you can see here.

416
00:12:12,776 --> 00:12:14,626
So, next is summary tag.

417
00:12:14,716 --> 00:12:15,916
This is an existing tag, and

418
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:16,856
this is the tag that we're

419
00:12:16,856 --> 00:12:18,536
recommending you use to store a

420
00:12:18,536 --> 00:12:20,446
descriptive sentence that best

421
00:12:20,446 --> 00:12:22,046
represents that episode.

422
00:12:22,436 --> 00:12:23,406
We'll use this in multiple

423
00:12:23,406 --> 00:12:24,496
places in the app, so we're

424
00:12:24,496 --> 00:12:26,476
asking that you leave out HTML,

425
00:12:26,576 --> 00:12:28,166
CDATA, rich text formatting.

426
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:29,666
In fact, we'll strip that out

427
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:32,006
because that will let us handle

428
00:12:32,006 --> 00:12:34,066
the truncation, and it'll let us

429
00:12:34,066 --> 00:12:35,276
handle that description in

430
00:12:35,306 --> 00:12:36,176
different parts of the app.

431
00:12:36,446 --> 00:12:37,326
So, if you're using a content

432
00:12:37,326 --> 00:12:38,566
management system that might

433
00:12:38,566 --> 00:12:39,766
truncate that beforehand, we're

434
00:12:39,766 --> 00:12:40,886
asking that you leave that, that

435
00:12:40,886 --> 00:12:42,486
you don't do that so that we can

436
00:12:42,486 --> 00:12:45,346
handle that and best present it.

437
00:12:46,026 --> 00:12:47,796
So, content encoded, this is

438
00:12:47,796 --> 00:12:49,716
specific for your episode notes,

439
00:12:49,766 --> 00:12:50,566
and this is where you're going

440
00:12:50,566 --> 00:12:52,146
to want to put that rich text,

441
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:53,706
HTML, links.

442
00:12:53,776 --> 00:12:55,536
We support paragraphs, lists,

443
00:12:55,796 --> 00:12:57,666
bold and italics, and we're

444
00:12:57,666 --> 00:12:58,886
going to use this on the Listen

445
00:12:58,886 --> 00:13:00,236
Now view, as well within the

446
00:12:58,886 --> 00:13:00,236
Now view, as well within the

447
00:13:00,236 --> 00:13:01,676
Episode Detail view, so

448
00:13:01,676 --> 00:13:03,316
listeners can easily access any

449
00:13:03,316 --> 00:13:04,446
links and notes while they

450
00:13:04,446 --> 00:13:05,436
listen to your episode.

451
00:13:08,186 --> 00:13:09,856
Another exciting update, we have

452
00:13:09,856 --> 00:13:10,576
podcast type.

453
00:13:10,576 --> 00:13:12,016
We also have episode type.

454
00:13:12,476 --> 00:13:14,126
So, in iOS 11, we're coming out

455
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:15,946
with three episode types, a

456
00:13:16,046 --> 00:13:18,136
full, trailer and bonus.

457
00:13:18,546 --> 00:13:20,096
So, full is the default episode

458
00:13:20,096 --> 00:13:21,036
type, and it represents a

459
00:13:21,036 --> 00:13:22,156
standard episode that you'd

460
00:13:22,156 --> 00:13:22,806
expect today.

461
00:13:23,516 --> 00:13:25,046
Trailer is a great new episode

462
00:13:25,046 --> 00:13:26,536
type that can be either a

463
00:13:26,606 --> 00:13:28,366
podcast level trailer or a

464
00:13:28,366 --> 00:13:30,086
season level trailer, depending

465
00:13:30,086 --> 00:13:31,136
on if there's a season number

466
00:13:31,176 --> 00:13:31,576
present.

467
00:13:31,576 --> 00:13:33,086
And this is great for teaser

468
00:13:33,086 --> 00:13:34,196
trailers before you've launched

469
00:13:34,196 --> 00:13:35,446
your show, or if you want to

470
00:13:35,446 --> 00:13:36,556
highlight a trailer for a new

471
00:13:36,556 --> 00:13:37,116
season.

472
00:13:37,596 --> 00:13:40,076
Bonus is for an episode that

473
00:13:40,076 --> 00:13:41,696
contains bonus content, which is

474
00:13:41,696 --> 00:13:43,306
great for supplemental content

475
00:13:43,306 --> 00:13:44,796
associated with an existing

476
00:13:44,796 --> 00:13:45,316
episode.

477
00:13:45,636 --> 00:13:47,586
After-show, or review, we'll tie

478
00:13:47,586 --> 00:13:49,096
them together in the UI, and

479
00:13:49,186 --> 00:13:50,656
with the main episode, we'll

480
00:13:50,656 --> 00:13:51,446
make it look really great.

481
00:13:52,276 --> 00:13:53,866
So, we're really excited to see

482
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:55,686
how podcasters utilize these new

483
00:13:55,686 --> 00:13:57,186
episode types to make their

484
00:13:57,186 --> 00:13:58,866
content even more engaging.

485
00:14:00,106 --> 00:14:01,586
So, lastly, I want to call out

486
00:14:01,586 --> 00:14:02,726
an existing, another existing

487
00:14:02,726 --> 00:14:04,196
tag on the episode, the GUID.

488
00:14:04,836 --> 00:14:06,716
So, GUID is a permanent global

489
00:14:06,716 --> 00:14:08,586
unique identifier that specifies

490
00:14:08,686 --> 00:14:10,416
that episode amongst your

491
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:10,766
podcast.

492
00:14:11,136 --> 00:14:12,016
We've seen some cases where

493
00:14:12,016 --> 00:14:13,086
people end up changing their

494
00:14:13,086 --> 00:14:14,256
GUID, perhaps if you change

495
00:14:14,256 --> 00:14:16,326
hosting companies, or your RSS

496
00:14:16,326 --> 00:14:18,236
URL changes, but it's really

497
00:14:18,236 --> 00:14:19,776
important that you not change

498
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:20,686
the GUID on an episode.

499
00:14:20,686 --> 00:14:22,226
This can result in duplicate

500
00:14:22,226 --> 00:14:23,386
episodes showing up in your

501
00:14:23,386 --> 00:14:25,056
subscribers' Libraries, and it

502
00:14:25,056 --> 00:14:25,806
can even hurt your chart

503
00:14:25,876 --> 00:14:26,936
placement in the catalog.

504
00:14:29,036 --> 00:14:30,926
So, those are the highlights of

505
00:14:30,926 --> 00:14:32,406
some of the updates coming to

506
00:14:32,406 --> 00:14:34,556
the Apple Podcast Feed Spec.

507
00:14:34,556 --> 00:14:35,976
These and all feed specs can be

508
00:14:35,976 --> 00:14:37,356
found online in our Resources

509
00:14:37,356 --> 00:14:38,636
and Help section, and we're

510
00:14:38,636 --> 00:14:39,526
really excited to see how

511
00:14:39,526 --> 00:14:40,986
podcast creators will use these

512
00:14:40,986 --> 00:14:43,256
updates to create even more

513
00:14:43,436 --> 00:14:45,056
content and better engaging

514
00:14:45,056 --> 00:14:46,226
content for our listeners.

515
00:14:46,776 --> 00:14:47,886
So, now that you've heard our

516
00:14:47,886 --> 00:14:49,346
great updates, I'd like to bring

517
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:50,706
James back up to talk about how

518
00:14:50,706 --> 00:14:51,916
to make the best podcast

519
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:52,286
possible.

520
00:14:52,956 --> 00:14:53,246
James.

521
00:14:54,321 --> 00:14:56,321
[ Applause ]

522
00:14:56,626 --> 00:14:56,906
&gt;&gt; All right.

523
00:14:56,906 --> 00:14:57,496
Thanks, Garth.

524
00:14:59,066 --> 00:15:02,646
So, now that you've seen all the

525
00:14:59,066 --> 00:15:02,646
So, now that you've seen all the

526
00:15:02,646 --> 00:15:04,866
new features of Podcasts app for

527
00:15:04,866 --> 00:15:06,776
iOS 11, and the tags that we're

528
00:15:06,836 --> 00:15:08,596
going to use, that we've just

529
00:15:08,596 --> 00:15:10,016
announced, to power those new

530
00:15:10,016 --> 00:15:11,746
features, let's walk through

531
00:15:11,746 --> 00:15:13,416
creating and launching your own

532
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:13,756
show.

533
00:15:15,196 --> 00:15:16,586
Well, first, you need something

534
00:15:16,586 --> 00:15:17,116
to say.

535
00:15:17,356 --> 00:15:19,096
You need an idea at the center

536
00:15:19,096 --> 00:15:21,036
of your podcast as a concept

537
00:15:21,176 --> 00:15:22,666
that will play out over the

538
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:24,386
course of your seasons and your

539
00:15:24,386 --> 00:15:25,046
episodes.

540
00:15:25,636 --> 00:15:27,446
Podcasts are unique in that

541
00:15:27,446 --> 00:15:29,116
they're not constrained by the

542
00:15:29,116 --> 00:15:31,166
formats of traditional media,

543
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:32,156
such as talk radio.

544
00:15:32,726 --> 00:15:34,146
This is a place where great

545
00:15:34,146 --> 00:15:35,966
stories will play out in long

546
00:15:35,966 --> 00:15:37,076
form in audio.

547
00:15:37,846 --> 00:15:39,896
So, our friends, Maria and John,

548
00:15:39,896 --> 00:15:41,796
they needed a great idea for

549
00:15:41,796 --> 00:15:43,316
their podcast project.

550
00:15:43,896 --> 00:15:46,426
Maria has her Ph.D. in history,

551
00:15:46,736 --> 00:15:47,996
and because she's passionate

552
00:15:47,996 --> 00:15:49,786
about food, she knows a lot

553
00:15:49,786 --> 00:15:51,336
about the history of different

554
00:15:51,336 --> 00:15:52,476
cuisines around the world.

555
00:15:52,476 --> 00:15:55,346
And her sidekick, John, loves to

556
00:15:55,346 --> 00:15:55,596
eat.

557
00:15:56,536 --> 00:15:58,636
So, what kind of a show could be

558
00:15:58,636 --> 00:16:00,146
a vehicle for their love of

559
00:15:58,636 --> 00:16:00,146
a vehicle for their love of

560
00:16:00,146 --> 00:16:03,426
cuisine and maybe force them to

561
00:16:03,426 --> 00:16:04,396
do some awesome travel?

562
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:09,256
The Very Hungry Tourists; Around

563
00:16:09,256 --> 00:16:10,816
the world, one bite at a time.

564
00:16:10,816 --> 00:16:12,046
They came up with their concept.

565
00:16:13,076 --> 00:16:15,336
And now that Maria and John have

566
00:16:15,336 --> 00:16:17,196
a concept for their show, they

567
00:16:17,196 --> 00:16:18,726
dive into the research and

568
00:16:18,726 --> 00:16:19,676
planning phase.

569
00:16:20,406 --> 00:16:22,416
What podcasts out there already

570
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:23,506
cover their topic?

571
00:16:24,326 --> 00:16:25,356
How could their podcast be

572
00:16:25,356 --> 00:16:25,886
different?

573
00:16:26,006 --> 00:16:27,196
Where is their potential

574
00:16:27,196 --> 00:16:28,576
audience, and how would their

575
00:16:28,576 --> 00:16:30,146
themes play out over the course

576
00:16:30,146 --> 00:16:30,956
of their episodes?

577
00:16:31,506 --> 00:16:32,756
How would they make their show

578
00:16:32,756 --> 00:16:33,556
sustainable?

579
00:16:34,236 --> 00:16:35,786
Is this a hobby or a business

580
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:36,396
project?

581
00:16:37,406 --> 00:16:38,686
Well, sustainability is, of

582
00:16:38,686 --> 00:16:40,256
course, a key to success at

583
00:16:40,256 --> 00:16:42,746
podcasts, both creatively and

584
00:16:42,746 --> 00:16:44,706
financially, and Maria and John

585
00:16:44,706 --> 00:16:45,576
decide that making their

586
00:16:45,576 --> 00:16:46,896
production financially

587
00:16:46,896 --> 00:16:48,336
sustainable is important.

588
00:16:48,976 --> 00:16:50,286
So, they looked at the biggest

589
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:51,886
and best podcasts in the

590
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:53,356
business models that they used.

591
00:16:53,896 --> 00:16:55,336
They found that ads and

592
00:16:55,386 --> 00:16:57,216
sponsorship are by far the most

593
00:16:57,216 --> 00:16:58,666
common model.

594
00:16:59,596 --> 00:17:01,836
Post-read ads, in particular are

595
00:16:59,596 --> 00:17:01,836
Post-read ads, in particular are

596
00:17:01,836 --> 00:17:03,446
successful and profitable.

597
00:17:04,226 --> 00:17:05,705
The second model, donation.

598
00:17:06,435 --> 00:17:08,876
This is the public media style,

599
00:17:08,955 --> 00:17:10,906
listener and community supported

600
00:17:10,906 --> 00:17:12,715
model, another great option for

601
00:17:12,715 --> 00:17:13,415
podcasts.

602
00:17:14,226 --> 00:17:15,786
Thirdly, they looked at upsell,

603
00:17:16,296 --> 00:17:17,796
which is the idea that the

604
00:17:17,796 --> 00:17:19,526
podcast audience coming to the

605
00:17:19,526 --> 00:17:22,146
free podcast could be converted

606
00:17:22,546 --> 00:17:24,286
to paying audience members

607
00:17:24,286 --> 00:17:25,616
through the for sale products

608
00:17:25,616 --> 00:17:26,906
related to the content of the

609
00:17:26,906 --> 00:17:27,445
podcast.

610
00:17:28,106 --> 00:17:29,536
So, for example, Maria's

611
00:17:29,596 --> 00:17:31,506
ancient, Book of Ancient Roman

612
00:17:31,506 --> 00:17:33,446
Recipes, available on iBooks,

613
00:17:33,446 --> 00:17:34,946
was a great target destination

614
00:17:35,066 --> 00:17:36,186
for the people interested in

615
00:17:36,186 --> 00:17:36,686
their podcast.

616
00:17:37,226 --> 00:17:39,956
When it comes to production

617
00:17:39,956 --> 00:17:41,986
strategy, Maria and John

618
00:17:41,986 --> 00:17:43,946
recognized that some of the most

619
00:17:43,946 --> 00:17:45,426
popular podcasts in the world

620
00:17:45,536 --> 00:17:47,366
used world class recording

621
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:47,956
studios.

622
00:17:48,516 --> 00:17:50,636
The pristine sound and extensive

623
00:17:50,696 --> 00:17:52,096
post production that results

624
00:17:52,096 --> 00:17:53,946
from this kind of facility gives

625
00:17:53,946 --> 00:17:55,586
you a high quality of audio

626
00:17:55,586 --> 00:17:56,156
episodes.

627
00:17:56,206 --> 00:17:57,056
It's fantastic.

628
00:17:57,306 --> 00:17:58,776
And incidentally, I hope you got

629
00:17:58,776 --> 00:18:00,176
a chance to try our podcast

630
00:17:58,776 --> 00:18:00,176
a chance to try our podcast

631
00:18:00,176 --> 00:18:02,396
studio here at WWDC, above the

632
00:18:02,396 --> 00:18:02,976
main floor.

633
00:18:03,516 --> 00:18:04,976
We've been around this week, and

634
00:18:04,976 --> 00:18:06,196
it has been a great success.

635
00:18:07,516 --> 00:18:09,246
Maria and John, of course, they

636
00:18:09,246 --> 00:18:10,136
needed something a little less

637
00:18:10,136 --> 00:18:11,396
expensive than a traditional

638
00:18:11,396 --> 00:18:11,906
studio.

639
00:18:12,536 --> 00:18:14,176
They wanted something portable

640
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:15,976
and easy to use without the need

641
00:18:15,976 --> 00:18:17,266
of an audio engineer or a

642
00:18:17,266 --> 00:18:18,416
dedicated producer.

643
00:18:19,106 --> 00:18:20,566
They found that the built-in mic

644
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:22,826
and the variety of high quality,

645
00:18:23,056 --> 00:18:25,696
third-party microphones made for

646
00:18:25,696 --> 00:18:26,956
iPhone sound just great.

647
00:18:28,576 --> 00:18:31,586
So, our heroes finished the

648
00:18:31,586 --> 00:18:33,486
production plan for Season 1 of

649
00:18:33,486 --> 00:18:34,706
The Very Hungry Tourists.

650
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:36,386
Now, it's time to think about

651
00:18:36,386 --> 00:18:38,196
launch, and their go to market

652
00:18:38,196 --> 00:18:39,346
distribution strategy.

653
00:18:39,966 --> 00:18:40,816
But first, they've got to

654
00:18:40,816 --> 00:18:42,626
consider the visual identity and

655
00:18:42,626 --> 00:18:43,946
the metadata of their show.

656
00:18:44,826 --> 00:18:46,726
Cover art and metadata is the

657
00:18:46,726 --> 00:18:48,446
product packaging of your

658
00:18:48,446 --> 00:18:49,176
podcast.

659
00:18:49,516 --> 00:18:51,076
So, the importance of these

660
00:18:51,076 --> 00:18:52,916
pieces is hard to overstate.

661
00:18:54,506 --> 00:18:56,026
Maria and John, their first pass

662
00:18:56,026 --> 00:18:57,376
at cover art design had some

663
00:18:57,376 --> 00:18:57,996
challenges.

664
00:18:58,676 --> 00:19:00,626
They've chosen to include both

665
00:18:58,676 --> 00:19:00,626
They've chosen to include both

666
00:19:00,626 --> 00:19:02,286
of their personal production

667
00:19:02,326 --> 00:19:04,726
company logos on top of their

668
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:05,616
central image.

669
00:19:06,306 --> 00:19:08,086
And the central thematic image,

670
00:19:08,196 --> 00:19:10,246
while it's thematically relevant

671
00:19:10,246 --> 00:19:12,176
and appropriate, it's complex,

672
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:14,136
and it makes the overlaid text

673
00:19:14,196 --> 00:19:15,876
hard to read.

674
00:19:16,066 --> 00:19:17,406
Also, the font size that they've

675
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:18,746
chosen, especially on the

676
00:19:18,746 --> 00:19:21,376
subtitle, is really small and

677
00:19:21,376 --> 00:19:22,286
hard to read on mobile.

678
00:19:23,376 --> 00:19:26,576
So, the duo then run through our

679
00:19:26,576 --> 00:19:28,226
best practices for cover art,

680
00:19:28,386 --> 00:19:29,396
using our checklist.

681
00:19:30,196 --> 00:19:32,426
They lay out a 3000 by 3000

682
00:19:32,476 --> 00:19:36,366
pixel JPEG or PNG compressed to

683
00:19:36,366 --> 00:19:38,106
be under 1 megabyte in size, so

684
00:19:38,106 --> 00:19:39,116
it's nice and lightweight for

685
00:19:39,116 --> 00:19:41,016
download with a clearly readable

686
00:19:41,016 --> 00:19:44,296
title and one thematic image or

687
00:19:44,296 --> 00:19:46,026
logo central to the design.

688
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:49,146
This is a design first for

689
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:51,276
mobile where most of their

690
00:19:51,276 --> 00:19:52,666
potential audience is going to

691
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:53,366
live on iPhone.

692
00:19:54,516 --> 00:19:56,876
So, the second pass at their

693
00:19:56,876 --> 00:19:58,276
design was much improved.

694
00:19:58,276 --> 00:19:59,526
Maria and John ran through the

695
00:19:59,526 --> 00:20:00,706
checklist, and this was the

696
00:19:59,526 --> 00:20:00,706
checklist, and this was the

697
00:20:00,746 --> 00:20:00,976
result.

698
00:20:01,746 --> 00:20:03,486
It' looks great on mobile, and

699
00:20:03,486 --> 00:20:05,676
it becomes the basis for the

700
00:20:05,676 --> 00:20:07,586
visual identity of their

701
00:20:07,586 --> 00:20:08,256
podcast.

702
00:20:08,856 --> 00:20:10,226
So, this runs across social

703
00:20:10,226 --> 00:20:12,546
media, blogs, traditional media,

704
00:20:12,846 --> 00:20:14,296
and other audience-building

705
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:15,706
destinations for their

706
00:20:15,706 --> 00:20:17,726
marketing, a single design

707
00:20:17,806 --> 00:20:19,066
that's reasonable and

708
00:20:19,066 --> 00:20:19,726
expandable.

709
00:20:22,196 --> 00:20:24,496
Similarly, Maria and John run

710
00:20:24,496 --> 00:20:26,016
through our metadata checklist

711
00:20:26,616 --> 00:20:27,436
where they land on their

712
00:20:27,436 --> 00:20:30,016
concise, attractive title with

713
00:20:30,016 --> 00:20:31,496
thorough descriptions, both at

714
00:20:31,496 --> 00:20:32,986
the podcast level and the

715
00:20:32,986 --> 00:20:33,876
episode level.

716
00:20:34,456 --> 00:20:36,196
They also make good use of our

717
00:20:36,196 --> 00:20:38,256
newly announced podcast type and

718
00:20:38,256 --> 00:20:39,436
episode number tags in their

719
00:20:39,436 --> 00:20:41,806
feed and, of course, thoughtful

720
00:20:41,806 --> 00:20:43,546
episode titles, putting the most

721
00:20:43,546 --> 00:20:45,606
important information about each

722
00:20:45,606 --> 00:20:47,386
individual episode, such as the

723
00:20:47,386 --> 00:20:49,096
subject matter or the guests

724
00:20:49,216 --> 00:20:50,716
right in the first bit of text

725
00:20:50,716 --> 00:20:51,186
of the title.

726
00:20:51,966 --> 00:20:53,826
And of course, they provide a

727
00:20:53,826 --> 00:20:56,526
useful link for those super fans

728
00:20:56,526 --> 00:20:57,696
that want to go beyond the

729
00:20:57,696 --> 00:20:59,276
podcast, connect to [inaudible]

730
00:20:59,406 --> 00:21:01,376
on the greater Web and then have

731
00:20:59,406 --> 00:21:01,376
on the greater Web and then have

732
00:21:01,376 --> 00:21:01,726
more.

733
00:21:02,346 --> 00:21:06,436
So, distribution; once Maria and

734
00:21:06,436 --> 00:21:08,546
John have their podcast episodes

735
00:21:08,546 --> 00:21:10,126
recorded, they've designed their

736
00:21:10,126 --> 00:21:11,986
cover art, the metadata has been

737
00:21:11,986 --> 00:21:13,736
written, they need a hosting

738
00:21:13,736 --> 00:21:15,106
partner to distribute their

739
00:21:15,106 --> 00:21:15,636
content.

740
00:21:16,296 --> 00:21:18,316
Our podcast resources and help

741
00:21:18,316 --> 00:21:20,576
site on Apple.com features a

742
00:21:20,576 --> 00:21:22,486
handy list of Apple podcasts

743
00:21:22,486 --> 00:21:23,426
hosting partners.

744
00:21:24,186 --> 00:21:25,376
These organizations are from

745
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:26,396
different regions around the

746
00:21:26,396 --> 00:21:27,786
world, and they offer us

747
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:29,536
different product packages and

748
00:21:29,536 --> 00:21:30,836
features and price points.

749
00:21:31,176 --> 00:21:32,796
So, Maria and John shop around

750
00:21:32,796 --> 00:21:34,216
for the best package for them.

751
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:36,656
Launch planning.

752
00:21:36,656 --> 00:21:38,576
Now, Maria and John can consider

753
00:21:38,576 --> 00:21:39,946
their launch and go to market

754
00:21:39,946 --> 00:21:40,476
plans.

755
00:21:41,146 --> 00:21:41,996
They decide to launch with a

756
00:21:41,996 --> 00:21:43,726
trailer as a teaser bit of

757
00:21:43,726 --> 00:21:45,546
content to drive awareness.

758
00:21:46,196 --> 00:21:47,376
They also look into marketing,

759
00:21:47,376 --> 00:21:49,036
social media; of course, paid

760
00:21:49,036 --> 00:21:49,636
and organic.

761
00:21:50,086 --> 00:21:52,376
They look at podcast, app, and

762
00:21:52,426 --> 00:21:54,516
search engine ads to drive

763
00:21:54,516 --> 00:21:56,346
additional awareness and, of

764
00:21:56,346 --> 00:21:57,636
course, appearances.

765
00:21:58,046 --> 00:21:59,806
This is the idea that Maria and

766
00:21:59,806 --> 00:22:01,526
John can not only appear on

767
00:21:59,806 --> 00:22:01,526
John can not only appear on

768
00:22:01,576 --> 00:22:03,176
other existing and popular

769
00:22:03,176 --> 00:22:05,406
podcasts to make those audiences

770
00:22:05,406 --> 00:22:07,036
that are maybe thematically

771
00:22:07,036 --> 00:22:08,646
related to their show aware of

772
00:22:08,646 --> 00:22:10,296
their new content offering, but

773
00:22:10,296 --> 00:22:11,566
of course taking advantage too

774
00:22:11,566 --> 00:22:12,966
of any traditional media outlets

775
00:22:13,276 --> 00:22:13,876
where they can make an

776
00:22:13,876 --> 00:22:15,016
appearance and talk about their

777
00:22:15,016 --> 00:22:17,636
new show as well.

778
00:22:18,096 --> 00:22:19,486
Maria and John also make good

779
00:22:19,486 --> 00:22:20,876
use of our marketing tools for

780
00:22:20,876 --> 00:22:22,616
podcasts, including our Identity

781
00:22:22,616 --> 00:22:24,256
Guide, which will give you best

782
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:25,946
practices for using our Listen

783
00:22:25,946 --> 00:22:27,896
on Apple Podcasts badges for

784
00:22:27,896 --> 00:22:29,826
print, web, and broadcast

785
00:22:29,826 --> 00:22:30,476
appearances.

786
00:22:31,036 --> 00:22:32,436
The Affiliate Program offers a

787
00:22:32,436 --> 00:22:34,736
unique way for people to link to

788
00:22:34,736 --> 00:22:36,116
their podcasts, and it features

789
00:22:36,116 --> 00:22:37,436
its own resources site.

790
00:22:38,216 --> 00:22:39,516
Additionally, Maria and John

791
00:22:39,516 --> 00:22:41,036
research and implement our

792
00:22:41,036 --> 00:22:42,376
linking tools like Banner

793
00:22:42,376 --> 00:22:43,596
Builder and Widget Builder.

794
00:22:44,176 --> 00:22:47,466
Our heroes, they're ready to

795
00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:48,996
submit to Apple Podcasts for

796
00:22:48,996 --> 00:22:49,836
review and approval.

797
00:22:50,216 --> 00:22:51,766
So, Maria logs into Podcasts

798
00:22:51,766 --> 00:22:53,946
Connect, pastes the feed URL

799
00:22:53,946 --> 00:22:56,656
from their hosting partner, and

800
00:22:56,656 --> 00:22:58,196
after approval of their podcast,

801
00:22:58,416 --> 00:22:59,866
Maria and John launch the Very

802
00:22:59,866 --> 00:23:00,646
Hungry Tourists.

803
00:22:59,866 --> 00:23:00,646
Hungry Tourists.

804
00:23:01,186 --> 00:23:02,936
What was once merely a moment of

805
00:23:02,936 --> 00:23:04,686
inspiration is now a written,

806
00:23:04,686 --> 00:23:06,656
produced, and easily available

807
00:23:06,656 --> 00:23:07,326
podcast.

808
00:23:08,196 --> 00:23:09,646
The work of audience building

809
00:23:09,646 --> 00:23:11,036
now begins, and we wish them

810
00:23:11,036 --> 00:23:11,436
good luck.

811
00:23:11,986 --> 00:23:13,196
We certainly will be listening.

812
00:23:13,836 --> 00:23:17,786
We'll be listening, but how many

813
00:23:17,786 --> 00:23:18,826
others are listening?

814
00:23:19,596 --> 00:23:21,896
Once Maria and John launch and

815
00:23:21,896 --> 00:23:23,336
begin marketing their podcast,

816
00:23:23,436 --> 00:23:24,636
of course, they want to know how

817
00:23:24,636 --> 00:23:25,066
it's doing.

818
00:23:25,876 --> 00:23:28,086
Their hosting platform offers a

819
00:23:28,086 --> 00:23:29,576
nice variety of server side

820
00:23:29,576 --> 00:23:30,936
reporting, which is very useful,

821
00:23:31,726 --> 00:23:33,356
but they want to know what's

822
00:23:33,356 --> 00:23:34,686
actually happening on Apple

823
00:23:34,686 --> 00:23:35,406
Podcasts.

824
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:37,106
How many people are listening?

825
00:23:37,716 --> 00:23:39,106
How much do they listen?

826
00:23:39,746 --> 00:23:40,686
Where are they listening?

827
00:23:42,036 --> 00:23:44,106
So many questions about audience

828
00:23:44,106 --> 00:23:45,736
and usage, what could we do to

829
00:23:45,736 --> 00:23:48,116
help Maria and John?

830
00:23:48,326 --> 00:23:50,146
Well, we're thrilled to announce

831
00:23:50,426 --> 00:23:52,286
Podcast Analytics, and we want

832
00:23:52,286 --> 00:23:53,416
to give you a sneak peek today.

833
00:23:55,046 --> 00:23:56,226
Yes, all right.

834
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:56,686
Thank you.

835
00:23:57,676 --> 00:23:58,606
We're thrilled to be sharing

836
00:23:58,606 --> 00:23:59,086
this with you.

837
00:23:59,086 --> 00:24:00,776
Our new reporting tool for

838
00:23:59,086 --> 00:24:00,776
Our new reporting tool for

839
00:24:00,776 --> 00:24:03,146
podcast providers will allow you

840
00:24:03,266 --> 00:24:05,226
to see how much of your podcast

841
00:24:05,266 --> 00:24:07,166
episodes are played and when on

842
00:24:07,166 --> 00:24:08,936
Apple Podcasts, compare the

843
00:24:08,936 --> 00:24:10,866
performance of your episodes and

844
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:13,886
podcasts over time, and see

845
00:24:13,886 --> 00:24:15,776
which parts of your episodes are

846
00:24:15,806 --> 00:24:17,166
more interesting than others.

847
00:24:17,546 --> 00:24:19,096
Are people skipping over your

848
00:24:19,096 --> 00:24:20,656
extended music intro, or maybe

849
00:24:20,656 --> 00:24:21,686
your second mid roll?

850
00:24:22,636 --> 00:24:23,866
We're doing this in a way that

851
00:24:23,866 --> 00:24:25,666
respects user privacy,

852
00:24:25,796 --> 00:24:28,046
aggregating usage data rather

853
00:24:28,046 --> 00:24:29,716
than sharing individual events.

854
00:24:30,536 --> 00:24:32,186
Analytics are not tied to

855
00:24:32,186 --> 00:24:34,546
individual Apple IDs, and users

856
00:24:34,546 --> 00:24:36,336
can reset their identifier at

857
00:24:37,106 --> 00:24:37,946
any time.

858
00:24:38,166 --> 00:24:39,506
We know that you'll have lots of

859
00:24:39,506 --> 00:24:40,946
questions, and we're excited

860
00:24:40,946 --> 00:24:42,596
about Podcast Analytics too, but

861
00:24:42,906 --> 00:24:44,176
we're still in development, so

862
00:24:44,176 --> 00:24:45,346
we're going to ask you to, if

863
00:24:45,346 --> 00:24:47,776
you can, hold questions until

864
00:24:48,136 --> 00:24:50,496
Podcast Analytics launches later

865
00:24:52,496 --> 00:24:52,796
this year.

866
00:24:53,086 --> 00:24:55,186
Launching this week, updates to

867
00:24:55,186 --> 00:24:57,156
our Apple Podcasts Spec and the

868
00:24:57,156 --> 00:24:58,526
documentation to help you

869
00:24:58,526 --> 00:24:59,636
implement those changes.

870
00:25:00,276 --> 00:25:02,206
New Podcasts app in iOS 11

871
00:25:02,206 --> 00:25:04,286
developer preview with improved

872
00:25:04,286 --> 00:25:05,836
presentation of podcasts, and

873
00:25:06,036 --> 00:25:07,826
the infrastructure for Podcast

874
00:25:07,986 --> 00:25:08,596
Analytics.

875
00:25:10,376 --> 00:25:12,686
There's more information on our

876
00:25:12,686 --> 00:25:13,596
Session page on

877
00:25:13,596 --> 00:25:15,326

878
00:25:15,326 --> 00:25:15,846
Thank you very much.
