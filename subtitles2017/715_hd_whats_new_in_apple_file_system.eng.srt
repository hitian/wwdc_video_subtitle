00:00:22,496 --> 00:00:22,976
&gt;&gt; Welcome everybody.

[ Applause ]

00:00:28,046 --> 00:00:30,376
My name is Eric Tamura, and I am

5
00:00:30,376 --> 00:00:31,626
a manager on the file systems

6
00:00:31,626 --> 00:00:33,876
team primarily for iOS and our

7
00:00:33,876 --> 00:00:35,236
embedded devices, and I'll be

8
00:00:35,746 --> 00:00:37,736
talking to you about what's new

9
00:00:37,736 --> 00:00:38,616
in Apple file system.

10
00:00:38,716 --> 00:00:39,956
I'll also be accompanied by

11
00:00:39,956 --> 00:00:42,056
Pavel Sokolov, who's a manager

12
00:00:42,056 --> 00:00:43,886
of the file systems team largely

13
00:00:43,886 --> 00:00:45,656
for the Mac.

14
00:00:45,866 --> 00:00:46,916
So let's get started.

15
00:00:48,406 --> 00:00:49,406
So this presentation will

16
00:00:49,406 --> 00:00:51,126
roughly be divided into two

17
00:00:51,126 --> 00:00:51,656
sections.

18
00:00:52,016 --> 00:00:52,836
I'll tell you a little bit more

19
00:00:52,836 --> 00:00:55,146
about what's new for iOS as well

20
00:00:55,226 --> 00:00:57,876
as tvOS, watchOS, and then Pavel

21
00:00:57,876 --> 00:00:59,066
will come up and tell you all

22
00:00:59,066 --> 00:01:01,216
about what's new on macOS.

23
00:00:59,066 --> 00:01:01,216
about what's new on macOS.

24
00:01:01,676 --> 00:01:06,556
So let's jump right in.

25
00:01:07,286 --> 00:01:10,146
So last year I got up on the

26
00:01:10,146 --> 00:01:11,576
stage at this conference, and I

27
00:01:11,576 --> 00:01:13,596
told all of you that Apple

28
00:01:14,066 --> 00:01:15,086
[inaudible] Apple file system,

29
00:01:15,206 --> 00:01:17,266
as the default for all devices

30
00:01:17,266 --> 00:01:19,386
starting in 2017, and we've

31
00:01:19,386 --> 00:01:20,356
certainly done that.

32
00:01:20,356 --> 00:01:23,186
So as of iOS 10.3 as well as our

33
00:01:23,186 --> 00:01:26,266
tvOS and watchOS analogs, all

34
00:01:26,266 --> 00:01:28,696
devices have been migrated to

35
00:01:28,766 --> 00:01:28,886
APFS.

36
00:01:28,886 --> 00:01:30,686
We'll tell you a little bit more

37
00:01:30,686 --> 00:01:31,146
about that.

38
00:01:32,076 --> 00:01:32,806
We'll talk a little bit more

39
00:01:32,806 --> 00:01:33,986
about the conversion process,

40
00:01:33,986 --> 00:01:35,296
how did devices actually move

41
00:01:35,296 --> 00:01:38,766
from HFS+ to APFS, and then a

42
00:01:38,766 --> 00:01:40,626
little bit on normalization and

43
00:01:40,626 --> 00:01:42,346
case sensitivity, particularly

44
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:44,826
as it relates to iOS devices.

45
00:01:45,736 --> 00:01:46,706
So let's talk about that

46
00:01:46,746 --> 00:01:47,206
conversion.

47
00:01:47,306 --> 00:01:51,996
So at this point, millions,

48
00:01:51,996 --> 00:01:53,176
literally hundreds of millions

49
00:01:53,176 --> 00:01:54,226
of devices have now been

50
00:01:54,226 --> 00:01:56,726
converted successfully to APFS.

00:01:57,516 --> 00:02:04,056
[ Applause ]

52
00:01:57,516 --> 00:02:04,056
[ Applause ]

53
00:02:04,556 --> 00:02:06,916
So starting on iOS 10.3 as well

54
00:02:06,916 --> 00:02:10,265
as tvOS and watchOS, Apple file

55
00:02:10,265 --> 00:02:11,286
system became the default.

56
00:02:11,286 --> 00:02:12,706
We had millions of devices

57
00:02:12,706 --> 00:02:13,186
converted.

58
00:02:14,116 --> 00:02:14,886
And one of the things you might

59
00:02:14,886 --> 00:02:16,056
have realized that this update

60
00:02:16,056 --> 00:02:17,096
actually does free up some

61
00:02:17,096 --> 00:02:19,146
storage for end users.

62
00:02:19,536 --> 00:02:20,906
In particular, there was space

63
00:02:20,906 --> 00:02:22,676
previously occupied by the prior

64
00:02:22,676 --> 00:02:24,276
volume manager, lightweight

65
00:02:24,276 --> 00:02:25,216
volume manager, which is no

66
00:02:25,216 --> 00:02:26,106
longer needed, and we were able

67
00:02:26,106 --> 00:02:27,636
to free up that space and give

68
00:02:27,636 --> 00:02:29,166
it back to users.

69
00:02:29,856 --> 00:02:30,856
One of the other things is that

70
00:02:30,856 --> 00:02:32,506
starting in iOS 11, we are able

71
00:02:32,506 --> 00:02:34,086
to start taking advantage of the

72
00:02:34,086 --> 00:02:36,576
APFS capabilities in iOS and

73
00:02:36,576 --> 00:02:37,786
tvOS and watchOS.

74
00:02:37,786 --> 00:02:39,716
Particularly iOS where iCloud

75
00:02:39,716 --> 00:02:42,146
backup can now use Snapshots in

76
00:02:42,146 --> 00:02:43,366
order to take a stable copy of

77
00:02:43,366 --> 00:02:45,286
the file system and upload

78
00:02:45,286 --> 00:02:46,896
everything to the Cloud without

79
00:02:46,896 --> 00:02:48,436
worrying about whether or not a

80
00:02:48,436 --> 00:02:50,136
process might be modifying a

81
00:02:50,136 --> 00:02:52,216
file and getting rights

82
00:02:52,216 --> 00:02:52,766
intermingled.

83
00:02:52,866 --> 00:02:54,596
And finally we've been listening

84
00:02:54,596 --> 00:02:56,016
to developer feedback in order

85
00:02:56,016 --> 00:02:57,756
to improve and refine the file

86
00:02:57,756 --> 00:02:59,256
system and all the software that

87
00:02:59,256 --> 00:02:59,956
we've been working on.

88
00:03:00,476 --> 00:03:02,186
So let's talk a little bit about

89
00:03:02,186 --> 00:03:03,286
that conversion process.

90
00:03:03,616 --> 00:03:09,196
So the APFS conversion occurs in

91
00:03:09,196 --> 00:03:11,586
line during the update to iOS

92
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:13,196
10.3 and beyond.

93
00:03:13,196 --> 00:03:14,276
So whether you're moving to iOS

94
00:03:14,276 --> 00:03:17,956
10.3, 10.3.2 or even iOS 11 from

95
00:03:17,956 --> 00:03:19,126
some prior update, it will

96
00:03:19,126 --> 00:03:20,806
automatically get converted.

97
00:03:21,526 --> 00:03:22,506
And one of the reasons that we

98
00:03:22,506 --> 00:03:23,276
were able to do this so

99
00:03:23,276 --> 00:03:24,686
successfully is that we actually

100
00:03:24,686 --> 00:03:26,746
employed a dry run conversion

101
00:03:27,016 --> 00:03:29,796
during iOS 10.0, 10.1, and 10.2

102
00:03:29,796 --> 00:03:31,776
and be able to track how the

103
00:03:31,776 --> 00:03:33,596
health of our conversion process

104
00:03:33,866 --> 00:03:34,766
was actually going.

105
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:37,026
And we've also been monitoring

106
00:03:37,026 --> 00:03:39,136
the health of the conversion

107
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:41,386
during iOS 10.3 and beyond

108
00:03:41,386 --> 00:03:44,316
updates, and we've been watching

109
00:03:44,316 --> 00:03:44,776
that as well.

110
00:03:45,686 --> 00:03:47,706
Finally, we've been also looking

111
00:03:47,706 --> 00:03:49,376
at the numbers and statistics

112
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,266
and everything that we're

113
00:03:50,686 --> 00:03:51,746
watching and be able to improve

114
00:03:51,746 --> 00:03:53,506
and refine the conversion on the

115
00:03:53,506 --> 00:03:54,436
Mac as well.

116
00:03:55,446 --> 00:03:57,186
So sometimes an illustration can

117
00:03:57,186 --> 00:03:59,216
help make this easier to

118
00:03:59,216 --> 00:04:00,806
understand, so I've got one

119
00:03:59,216 --> 00:04:00,806
understand, so I've got one

120
00:04:00,806 --> 00:04:00,986
here.

121
00:04:02,006 --> 00:04:03,496
So let's assume that this

122
00:04:03,786 --> 00:04:05,646
rectangle represents the

123
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:08,236
entirety of a block device and

124
00:04:08,236 --> 00:04:09,656
on the far left you'll notice

125
00:04:09,656 --> 00:04:11,086
that there's and SB that really

126
00:04:11,086 --> 00:04:12,966
refers to the superblock or the

127
00:04:12,966 --> 00:04:14,526
HFS+ volume header.

128
00:04:15,066 --> 00:04:16,526
Let's say for simplification we

129
00:04:16,526 --> 00:04:18,976
have three metadata regions that

130
00:04:18,976 --> 00:04:20,745
report all the entirety of what

131
00:04:20,745 --> 00:04:21,805
the file system might be

132
00:04:22,026 --> 00:04:23,096
tracking, things like file

133
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:25,506
names, time stamps, where the

134
00:04:25,506 --> 00:04:26,876
blocks actually live on disk,

135
00:04:26,876 --> 00:04:28,236
and that we also have two

136
00:04:28,236 --> 00:04:30,076
regions labeled file data, and

137
00:04:30,636 --> 00:04:31,526
if you recall during the

138
00:04:31,526 --> 00:04:32,926
conversion process the goal is

139
00:04:32,926 --> 00:04:35,176
to only replace the metadata and

140
00:04:35,176 --> 00:04:36,516
not touch the file data.

141
00:04:36,516 --> 00:04:37,826
We want that to stay exactly

142
00:04:37,826 --> 00:04:39,756
where it is as if nothing had

143
00:04:39,756 --> 00:04:41,226
happened to it.

144
00:04:42,246 --> 00:04:43,006
So the first thing that we're

145
00:04:43,006 --> 00:04:44,816
going to do is identify exactly

146
00:04:44,816 --> 00:04:46,426
where the metadata is, and as

147
00:04:46,426 --> 00:04:48,276
we're walking through it we'll

148
00:04:48,276 --> 00:04:49,656
start writing it into the free

149
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:52,226
space of the HFS+ volume.

150
00:04:52,716 --> 00:04:54,776
And what this gives us is crash

151
00:04:54,776 --> 00:04:55,916
protection and the ability to

152
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:56,886
recover in the event that

153
00:04:56,886 --> 00:04:58,136
conversion doesn't actually

154
00:04:58,136 --> 00:04:58,566
succeed.

155
00:04:59,636 --> 00:05:00,966
Now the metadata is identified.

156
00:04:59,636 --> 00:05:00,966
Now the metadata is identified.

157
00:05:01,706 --> 00:05:02,836
We'll then start to write it out

158
00:05:02,836 --> 00:05:04,756
to disk, and at this point, if

159
00:05:04,756 --> 00:05:05,896
we were doing a dry-run

160
00:05:05,896 --> 00:05:07,586
conversion, we'd end here.

161
00:05:08,506 --> 00:05:10,396
If we're completing the process,

162
00:05:11,126 --> 00:05:12,956
we will write the new superblock

163
00:05:13,026 --> 00:05:14,766
on top of the old one, and now

164
00:05:14,766 --> 00:05:17,016
we have an APFS volume.

165
00:05:17,746 --> 00:05:18,986
The final step is to simply

166
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:20,346
remove the metadata that was

167
00:05:20,406 --> 00:05:22,536
previously occupied by the HFS+

168
00:05:22,536 --> 00:05:22,996
content.

169
00:05:23,816 --> 00:05:25,736
We'll do that, and at this point

170
00:05:25,736 --> 00:05:28,006
it's a completely converted APFS

171
00:05:28,176 --> 00:05:28,546
volume.

172
00:05:28,896 --> 00:05:33,576
So now a quick word on Unicode.

173
00:05:35,456 --> 00:05:37,006
So if you know anything about

174
00:05:37,006 --> 00:05:37,866
Unicode, you know there's

175
00:05:37,866 --> 00:05:39,476
actually multiple variants, but

176
00:05:39,476 --> 00:05:40,836
for the purpose of discussion

177
00:05:40,836 --> 00:05:43,106
here, I will only be referring

178
00:05:43,416 --> 00:05:45,516
two really, which are NFC and

179
00:05:45,516 --> 00:05:47,156
NFD, and these roughly

180
00:05:47,156 --> 00:05:48,546
correspond to precomposed

181
00:05:48,546 --> 00:05:50,536
characters versus decomposed

182
00:05:50,536 --> 00:05:51,126
characters.

183
00:05:51,746 --> 00:05:53,406
And what this means is that you

184
00:05:53,406 --> 00:05:54,386
can actually store the same

185
00:05:54,386 --> 00:05:55,906
character visually, the same

186
00:05:55,906 --> 00:05:57,056
visual representation can

187
00:05:57,056 --> 00:05:58,816
actually be stored multiple ways

188
00:05:59,136 --> 00:06:00,276
depending on which form you're

189
00:05:59,136 --> 00:06:00,276
depending on which form you're

190
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:00,606
using.

191
00:06:01,356 --> 00:06:03,846
Now prior to iOS 11, APFS stored

192
00:06:04,136 --> 00:06:05,956
file names as nonnormalized

193
00:06:06,246 --> 00:06:08,426
UTF-8, and what this means is

194
00:06:08,426 --> 00:06:09,946
that if you have a file with one

195
00:06:09,946 --> 00:06:11,946
representation versus the other,

196
00:06:12,106 --> 00:06:13,436
they will actually be treated as

197
00:06:13,436 --> 00:06:14,376
different file names for the

198
00:06:14,376 --> 00:06:16,816
purposes of lookup and creation

199
00:06:16,816 --> 00:06:17,576
and comparison.

200
00:06:18,326 --> 00:06:19,756
So let's give another example to

201
00:06:20,216 --> 00:06:21,406
make this easier to understand.

202
00:06:22,176 --> 00:06:23,266
Let's say we have the character

203
00:06:23,546 --> 00:06:25,066
n with tilde or [foreign

204
00:06:25,136 --> 00:06:26,176
language] in Spanish.

205
00:06:26,546 --> 00:06:27,646
You can represent this as the

206
00:06:27,686 --> 00:06:29,926
Unicode hex f1 character.

207
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:31,846
Alternatively, you can also

208
00:06:31,846 --> 00:06:33,606
store it as a decomposed

209
00:06:33,606 --> 00:06:34,696
character in which the n is

210
00:06:34,696 --> 00:06:36,366
stored separately from the

211
00:06:36,366 --> 00:06:36,726
tilde.

212
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:39,356
Now in this case, on the right

213
00:06:39,356 --> 00:06:40,846
the n and the tilde will be

214
00:06:40,846 --> 00:06:41,956
stored as two separate code

215
00:06:41,956 --> 00:06:43,146
points; however, they will be

216
00:06:43,346 --> 00:06:44,826
treated as having to be combined

217
00:06:44,826 --> 00:06:46,626
for the purposes of visually

218
00:06:46,626 --> 00:06:48,326
representing that character on

219
00:06:48,326 --> 00:06:48,856
your screen.

220
00:06:51,776 --> 00:06:56,536
So the problem is that even if

221
00:06:56,536 --> 00:06:58,286
the file system is taking care

222
00:06:58,286 --> 00:06:59,566
to treat these as separate,

223
00:06:59,566 --> 00:07:00,526
that's not necessarily what the

224
00:06:59,566 --> 00:07:00,526
that's not necessarily what the

225
00:07:00,526 --> 00:07:04,676
rest of the system expects and

226
00:07:04,676 --> 00:07:05,326
interacts with.

227
00:07:05,326 --> 00:07:06,176
This might be well-defined

228
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:07,786
behavior for NFS; however, you

229
00:07:07,786 --> 00:07:08,706
want to make sure that the

230
00:07:08,706 --> 00:07:10,636
entire software stack from file

231
00:07:10,636 --> 00:07:11,676
system all the way up to

232
00:07:11,676 --> 00:07:13,326
foundation and above is able to

233
00:07:13,326 --> 00:07:14,216
treat everything properly.

234
00:07:14,946 --> 00:07:16,446
So in order to rectify this,

235
00:07:16,446 --> 00:07:18,276
we're introducing two new

236
00:07:18,276 --> 00:07:20,166
normalization schemes for Apple

237
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:20,826
file system.

238
00:07:21,226 --> 00:07:22,866
We have a native scheme as well

239
00:07:22,866 --> 00:07:24,216
as a runtime normalization

240
00:07:24,216 --> 00:07:24,616
scheme.

241
00:07:24,956 --> 00:07:26,686
Now the native normalization

242
00:07:26,686 --> 00:07:28,486
scheme is available in your high

243
00:07:28,486 --> 00:07:29,926
Sierra beta that you got earlier

244
00:07:29,926 --> 00:07:31,796
this week for case-sensitive

245
00:07:31,986 --> 00:07:32,966
volumes only.

246
00:07:33,116 --> 00:07:34,896
For case insensitive content,

247
00:07:34,896 --> 00:07:36,486
Pavel will get up on stage in a

248
00:07:36,486 --> 00:07:37,676
little bit and tell you all

249
00:07:37,676 --> 00:07:38,206
about that.

250
00:07:38,946 --> 00:07:39,996
The native normalization is

251
00:07:39,996 --> 00:07:42,796
coming soon for iOS 11 for erase

252
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:43,486
restores only.

253
00:07:43,486 --> 00:07:45,206
This means if you plugged in the

254
00:07:45,206 --> 00:07:47,286
phone or other device to iTunes

255
00:07:47,286 --> 00:07:49,236
and did a restore to factory

256
00:07:49,236 --> 00:07:51,166
settings starting with iOS 11

257
00:07:51,366 --> 00:07:52,636
will automatically pick this up.

258
00:07:53,286 --> 00:07:54,486
However, we don't want anyone to

259
00:07:54,486 --> 00:07:56,146
have to erase install in order

260
00:07:56,146 --> 00:07:57,536
to get this behavior.

261
00:07:57,656 --> 00:07:59,766
So we're also introducing a new

262
00:07:59,766 --> 00:08:01,816
runtime normalization mechanism,

263
00:07:59,766 --> 00:08:01,816
runtime normalization mechanism,

264
00:08:01,866 --> 00:08:03,056
and the runtime normalization

265
00:08:03,056 --> 00:08:04,046
will automatically convert

266
00:08:04,046 --> 00:08:06,986
between the NFC content versus

267
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:09,286
the NFD for the purposes of file

268
00:08:09,286 --> 00:08:10,656
comparison, being able to do

269
00:08:10,926 --> 00:08:11,446
lookups.

270
00:08:11,446 --> 00:08:12,596
If it doesn't find one, it will

271
00:08:12,596 --> 00:08:13,906
automatically look up with the

272
00:08:13,906 --> 00:08:15,386
other to make sure that your app

273
00:08:15,436 --> 00:08:17,126
doesn't receive an ENOENT

274
00:08:17,126 --> 00:08:17,886
[phonetic] error back from the

275
00:08:17,886 --> 00:08:18,436
file system.

276
00:08:19,366 --> 00:08:20,376
And a future update will

277
00:08:20,376 --> 00:08:22,076
automatically convert devices

278
00:08:22,076 --> 00:08:24,696
from whatever form they were in,

279
00:08:24,696 --> 00:08:25,956
if they were already migrated

280
00:08:25,956 --> 00:08:28,476
starting in 10.3 or 10.3.2 to

281
00:08:28,476 --> 00:08:31,046
the new form in a future update.

282
00:08:31,826 --> 00:08:35,106
So that's the update for iOS,

283
00:08:35,106 --> 00:08:36,056
and with that, I'm going to hand

284
00:08:36,056 --> 00:08:37,296
it off to Pavel, who is going to

285
00:08:37,296 --> 00:08:37,976
tell you all about the Mac.

286
00:08:38,515 --> 00:08:43,515
[ Applause ]

287
00:08:44,516 --> 00:08:49,716
[ Background Noise ]

288
00:08:50,216 --> 00:08:51,216
&gt;&gt; Good morning everyone.

289
00:08:51,616 --> 00:08:53,726
My name is Pavel Sokolov, and I

290
00:08:53,726 --> 00:08:56,536
manage file system team in

291
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:56,836
Apple.

292
00:08:57,706 --> 00:08:59,016
Today I'm going to talk to you

293
00:08:59,016 --> 00:09:02,926
about what's new in macOS with

294
00:08:59,016 --> 00:09:02,926
about what's new in macOS with

295
00:09:03,146 --> 00:09:05,626
regards to APFS.

296
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:06,456
Let's begin.

297
00:09:08,016 --> 00:09:10,516
So first, I would like to talk

298
00:09:10,516 --> 00:09:12,596
to you about what features are

299
00:09:12,596 --> 00:09:14,706
here just in case you missed the

300
00:09:14,706 --> 00:09:15,976
presentation from the previous

301
00:09:15,976 --> 00:09:16,226
year.

302
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:22,016
Important features that we

303
00:09:22,246 --> 00:09:23,736
have-- first of all, I would

304
00:09:23,736 --> 00:09:27,066
like to remind you that APFS is

305
00:09:27,306 --> 00:09:29,336
available to every

306
00:09:29,656 --> 00:09:31,036
Apple-supported platform.

307
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:35,006
It works on iOS, tvOS, even on

308
00:09:35,006 --> 00:09:37,136
your watch, and macOS, of

309
00:09:37,136 --> 00:09:37,396
course.

310
00:09:38,676 --> 00:09:40,706
One of the awesome features is

311
00:09:40,706 --> 00:09:41,236
cloning.

312
00:09:41,626 --> 00:09:44,026
It allows you to do fast copies

313
00:09:44,026 --> 00:09:44,776
of the files.

314
00:09:45,186 --> 00:09:46,596
It employs our copy-on-write

315
00:09:46,596 --> 00:09:48,726
technology that also powers our

316
00:09:48,726 --> 00:09:49,376
Snapshots.

317
00:09:50,176 --> 00:09:55,086
Snapshots allow you to take a

318
00:09:55,176 --> 00:09:56,016
[inaudible] Snapshot of your

319
00:09:56,016 --> 00:09:57,666
file system, entire file system,

320
00:09:57,916 --> 00:09:59,846
remember it's date, and later

321
00:09:59,976 --> 00:10:01,746
possibly return to it.

322
00:09:59,976 --> 00:10:01,746
possibly return to it.

323
00:10:02,466 --> 00:10:03,926
We will also natively support

324
00:10:03,926 --> 00:10:04,556
encryption.

325
00:10:05,076 --> 00:10:07,306
We have space sharing.

326
00:10:07,736 --> 00:10:08,936
I'm going to talk to you about

327
00:10:08,936 --> 00:10:10,656
that a little bit later, and we

328
00:10:10,656 --> 00:10:11,976
introduce defragmentation.

329
00:10:14,156 --> 00:10:17,116
How will get to APFS you might

330
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:17,446
wonder?

331
00:10:18,206 --> 00:10:20,346
So let's talk a little bit about

332
00:10:21,156 --> 00:10:21,266
that.

333
00:10:21,476 --> 00:10:23,096
Actually, all you have to do is

334
00:10:23,096 --> 00:10:25,486
simply call a new macOS High

335
00:10:25,486 --> 00:10:27,586
Sierra and your system volume

336
00:10:28,056 --> 00:10:29,416
could automatically be converted

337
00:10:29,506 --> 00:10:30,156
by installer.

338
00:10:30,736 --> 00:10:33,476
In case you wonder what happens

339
00:10:33,476 --> 00:10:35,156
with other volumes, they are not

340
00:10:35,156 --> 00:10:36,076
going to be automatically

341
00:10:36,076 --> 00:10:37,576
converted, but you can still

342
00:10:37,576 --> 00:10:38,546
manually do so.

343
00:10:39,436 --> 00:10:42,756
If you convert multiple volumes,

344
00:10:43,146 --> 00:10:44,586
the important point to remember

345
00:10:44,586 --> 00:10:46,766
after conversion each volume

346
00:10:46,766 --> 00:10:48,346
becomes APFS container.

347
00:10:48,616 --> 00:10:49,966
I'm going to talk about that a

348
00:10:49,966 --> 00:10:50,646
little bit later.

349
00:10:51,586 --> 00:10:53,136
And multiple containers do not

350
00:10:53,136 --> 00:10:53,736
share space.

351
00:10:55,106 --> 00:10:56,686
Space sharing is one of the most

352
00:10:56,686 --> 00:10:58,776
important and awesome features

353
00:10:58,776 --> 00:11:00,176
that's going to save you space.

354
00:10:58,776 --> 00:11:00,176
that's going to save you space.

355
00:11:01,746 --> 00:11:03,106
And we would like you to take

356
00:11:03,106 --> 00:11:04,426
advantage of that, and I can

357
00:11:04,426 --> 00:11:07,496
show you how.

358
00:11:08,196 --> 00:11:11,086
You might wonder what volumes

359
00:11:11,086 --> 00:11:12,146
are supported, what we can

360
00:11:12,146 --> 00:11:13,836
convert APFS.

361
00:11:14,976 --> 00:11:17,706
We can convert HFS+ volumes,

362
00:11:18,306 --> 00:11:22,146
CoreStorage, Fusion, and even

363
00:11:22,146 --> 00:11:23,316
FileVault encrypted.

364
00:11:24,566 --> 00:11:26,176
They all become APFS

365
00:11:27,326 --> 00:11:27,996
automatically.

366
00:11:28,636 --> 00:11:34,216
If you'd like to do a manual

367
00:11:34,216 --> 00:11:37,256
conversion of your existing

368
00:11:37,256 --> 00:11:39,776
volume, all you have to do is go

369
00:11:39,776 --> 00:11:40,946
to disk utility [inaudible],

370
00:11:41,776 --> 00:11:43,506
right click on the volume,

371
00:11:43,936 --> 00:11:46,366
select convert to APFS, and here

372
00:11:46,476 --> 00:11:46,896
you go.

373
00:11:48,016 --> 00:11:51,246
As I mentioned, if you do so,

374
00:11:51,246 --> 00:11:54,096
the volume becomes a container

375
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:56,726
and continues do not share

376
00:11:56,726 --> 00:11:57,136
space.

377
00:11:57,776 --> 00:11:59,226
We would recommend if you have

378
00:11:59,226 --> 00:12:00,626
multiple volumes and would like

379
00:11:59,226 --> 00:12:00,626
multiple volumes and would like

380
00:12:00,626 --> 00:12:01,586
to take advantage of that

381
00:12:01,586 --> 00:12:03,676
feature that you actually go and

382
00:12:03,676 --> 00:12:05,026
add volumes to the system

383
00:12:05,026 --> 00:12:07,916
container and move your data

384
00:12:08,656 --> 00:12:08,776
over.

385
00:12:09,016 --> 00:12:10,096
Why space sharing is so

386
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:10,996
important and what's so good

387
00:12:10,996 --> 00:12:11,386
about it?

388
00:12:12,306 --> 00:12:13,806
Let's talk a little bit about

389
00:12:13,806 --> 00:12:13,976
that.

390
00:12:14,696 --> 00:12:18,886
Here's the typical volume layout

391
00:12:18,886 --> 00:12:20,416
that you might have as a

392
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:20,966
developer.

393
00:12:22,156 --> 00:12:23,746
You probably have multiple

394
00:12:23,746 --> 00:12:24,336
volumes, right?

395
00:12:24,856 --> 00:12:28,516
What's the deal with multiple

396
00:12:28,516 --> 00:12:30,886
volumes is as you start running

397
00:12:30,886 --> 00:12:32,386
out of space in each of them,

398
00:12:33,696 --> 00:12:35,316
you might have a little bit of

399
00:12:35,396 --> 00:12:36,996
free space here, a little bit of

400
00:12:36,996 --> 00:12:39,146
free space there, but you do not

401
00:12:39,146 --> 00:12:40,416
have enough in one single

402
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:42,186
location so when you try to copy

403
00:12:42,186 --> 00:12:45,826
your files, nothing you can do.

404
00:12:46,086 --> 00:12:50,306
In APFS world, the container is

405
00:12:50,496 --> 00:12:52,476
a partition on your volume, and

406
00:12:52,476 --> 00:12:55,046
volumes share the free space of

407
00:12:55,046 --> 00:12:55,796
that partition.

408
00:12:56,946 --> 00:12:58,066
So let's look at that picture.

409
00:12:58,326 --> 00:13:01,156
In a typical case, you would

410
00:12:58,326 --> 00:13:01,156
In a typical case, you would

411
00:13:01,156 --> 00:13:02,346
have a GPT header, [inaudible]

412
00:13:02,346 --> 00:13:05,086
service partition, and

413
00:13:05,356 --> 00:13:06,726
[inaudible] each volume is a

414
00:13:06,726 --> 00:13:07,316
partition.

415
00:13:07,586 --> 00:13:10,766
In APFS world, as I said, we

416
00:13:10,986 --> 00:13:12,576
have eight containers of this

417
00:13:12,626 --> 00:13:13,576
partition and volume [inaudible]

418
00:13:13,576 --> 00:13:15,136
side of it.

419
00:13:15,596 --> 00:13:16,596
Let's say you want to fill up

420
00:13:16,596 --> 00:13:17,116
the space.

421
00:13:17,476 --> 00:13:19,786
As you can see in HFS you run

422
00:13:19,786 --> 00:13:20,076
out.

423
00:13:21,006 --> 00:13:22,756
In APFS, you still can use your

424
00:13:22,756 --> 00:13:27,176
free space and have your data

425
00:13:28,176 --> 00:13:28,276
here.

426
00:13:28,496 --> 00:13:30,146
Let's explore the cloning.

427
00:13:31,736 --> 00:13:32,946
Cloning is [inaudible].

428
00:13:32,946 --> 00:13:34,276
It allows you to make fast

429
00:13:34,276 --> 00:13:35,296
copies of the files.

430
00:13:35,996 --> 00:13:38,186
In this particular case, let's

431
00:13:38,186 --> 00:13:39,396
take a local [inaudible] file.

432
00:13:39,396 --> 00:13:42,036
It has a couple of blocks, and

433
00:13:42,946 --> 00:13:44,586
traditionally if you copy a file

434
00:13:44,886 --> 00:13:46,406
you have to copy the data over,

435
00:13:46,406 --> 00:13:47,666
and that takes time.

436
00:13:48,126 --> 00:13:49,696
Not only it takes time, it takes

437
00:13:49,696 --> 00:13:50,006
space.

438
00:13:51,146 --> 00:13:54,176
In APFS, all we have to do is to

439
00:13:54,176 --> 00:13:55,466
record the references to that

440
00:13:55,466 --> 00:13:57,626
file, remember where the file

441
00:13:57,626 --> 00:14:02,186
is, and only your metadata is

442
00:13:57,626 --> 00:14:02,186
is, and only your metadata is

443
00:14:02,186 --> 00:14:02,386
[inaudible].

444
00:14:02,386 --> 00:14:04,386
It's also because it's fast and

445
00:14:04,436 --> 00:14:05,706
you don't waste space.

446
00:14:06,626 --> 00:14:08,716
You might wonder what happens if

447
00:14:08,716 --> 00:14:09,736
I have to modify the file.

448
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:12,626
It's a single copy after all.

449
00:14:13,706 --> 00:14:15,766
What happens is that copy and

450
00:14:15,766 --> 00:14:18,446
write technology kicks in, and

451
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:21,746
the new file data is located in

452
00:14:21,746 --> 00:14:23,436
the free space, and we just

453
00:14:23,436 --> 00:14:24,826
create yet additional reference.

454
00:14:26,126 --> 00:14:30,996
Quite simple, saves you space.

455
00:14:31,206 --> 00:14:33,456
Let's explore another

456
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:35,186
interesting aspect of APFS is

457
00:14:35,186 --> 00:14:35,936
sparse files.

458
00:14:35,936 --> 00:14:37,416
Let me give you an example.

459
00:14:37,886 --> 00:14:40,876
Let's say you have a picture of

460
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:43,356
a cat on your desktop, something

461
00:14:43,356 --> 00:14:47,716
like that, and you want to edit

462
00:14:48,366 --> 00:14:48,446
it.

463
00:14:51,316 --> 00:14:53,776
Well let's say in APFS world and

464
00:14:53,776 --> 00:14:55,906
both in HFS world, you would

465
00:14:55,906 --> 00:14:57,726
have the same initial view.

466
00:14:58,376 --> 00:15:00,606
You have a file that's 1

467
00:14:58,376 --> 00:15:00,606
You have a file that's 1

468
00:15:00,606 --> 00:15:02,476
megabyte in size, is

469
00:15:02,476 --> 00:15:04,406
[inaudible], and you want to

470
00:15:04,406 --> 00:15:06,116
edit that.

471
00:15:06,236 --> 00:15:07,266
What would happen if your

472
00:15:07,266 --> 00:15:09,326
application for example decides

473
00:15:09,396 --> 00:15:11,456
to seek past the end of the file

474
00:15:11,456 --> 00:15:12,916
and do additional write.

475
00:15:13,796 --> 00:15:15,176
Here's where the difference is.

476
00:15:16,286 --> 00:15:19,516
In HFS, the file system would

477
00:15:19,516 --> 00:15:21,896
fill the space that you seek

478
00:15:22,376 --> 00:15:25,066
after with zeros, and your file

479
00:15:25,066 --> 00:15:28,016
would be 3 megabytes of size,

480
00:15:28,016 --> 00:15:28,206
right?

481
00:15:29,246 --> 00:15:30,596
So mega portion of the file

482
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,006
would be zeroed out by the file

483
00:15:32,006 --> 00:15:33,436
system, and it would take your

484
00:15:33,436 --> 00:15:33,826
space.

485
00:15:34,816 --> 00:15:36,746
In APFS, what you would have is

486
00:15:36,746 --> 00:15:37,506
a sparse file.

487
00:15:38,806 --> 00:15:40,896
So middle portion of the file,

488
00:15:40,896 --> 00:15:42,376
still logically here, if you

489
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:44,606
read from that, you would read

490
00:15:44,606 --> 00:15:46,656
zeros, but physically it takes

491
00:15:46,656 --> 00:15:47,386
only two blocks.

492
00:15:48,466 --> 00:15:50,516
Again, saves you space, makes

493
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:52,606
your life faster, but you have

494
00:15:52,656 --> 00:15:53,716
to be aware of that feature.

495
00:15:54,156 --> 00:15:57,366
So as you can see, there are two

496
00:15:57,366 --> 00:15:57,936
sizes.

497
00:15:58,836 --> 00:16:00,426
Logical size and the physical

498
00:15:58,836 --> 00:16:00,426
Logical size and the physical

499
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:00,726
size.

500
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:03,486
You need to be aware of that,

501
00:16:04,106 --> 00:16:06,566
but it actually becomes a little

502
00:16:06,566 --> 00:16:08,386
bit more complicated if you put

503
00:16:08,386 --> 00:16:11,726
Snapshots or clones into the

504
00:16:12,496 --> 00:16:12,716
picture.

505
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:15,206
So let's explore that a little

506
00:16:15,206 --> 00:16:15,656
bit.

507
00:16:15,706 --> 00:16:18,556
How big is your file is

508
00:16:18,556 --> 00:16:18,716
[inaudible].

509
00:16:18,716 --> 00:16:20,986
Let's say the same situation

510
00:16:20,986 --> 00:16:23,366
applies and you have a file that

511
00:16:23,366 --> 00:16:25,136
sparse, only takes two blocks

512
00:16:25,136 --> 00:16:25,936
and just going to take a

513
00:16:25,936 --> 00:16:28,146
Snapshot, record the location of

514
00:16:28,146 --> 00:16:30,176
those blocks, and now we want to

515
00:16:30,176 --> 00:16:31,106
modify the file.

516
00:16:31,586 --> 00:16:34,656
As you see, copy and write

517
00:16:34,656 --> 00:16:35,706
technique kicks in, will

518
00:16:35,706 --> 00:16:38,026
allocate new space for the new

519
00:16:38,026 --> 00:16:39,016
block that you just wrote.

520
00:16:40,496 --> 00:16:41,586
So how big is your file?

521
00:16:42,036 --> 00:16:43,876
It's still three megabytes,

522
00:16:44,006 --> 00:16:44,256
right?

523
00:16:45,636 --> 00:16:47,616
Physically you still only have

524
00:16:47,696 --> 00:16:49,796
two blocks for it allocated, but

525
00:16:49,796 --> 00:16:51,636
[inaudible] delete the file, you

526
00:16:51,636 --> 00:16:53,176
only get the one block back,

527
00:16:53,296 --> 00:16:54,506
important thing that you need to

528
00:16:54,506 --> 00:16:56,996
be aware about.

529
00:16:57,086 --> 00:17:00,006
So let's talk a little bit about

530
00:16:57,086 --> 00:17:00,006
So let's talk a little bit about

531
00:17:00,006 --> 00:17:02,106
next important aspect in your

532
00:17:02,106 --> 00:17:04,185
file system is Unicodes and

533
00:17:04,185 --> 00:17:05,826
normalization support.

534
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:10,796
As you guys all know, that's

535
00:17:10,906 --> 00:17:12,786
almost invisible until we have

536
00:17:12,786 --> 00:17:13,346
problems.

537
00:17:14,516 --> 00:17:17,026
So let's explore how the world

538
00:17:17,026 --> 00:17:19,756
differs in APFS versus HFS.

539
00:17:20,356 --> 00:17:23,076
By default, APFS is case

540
00:17:23,076 --> 00:17:25,346
insensitive and normalization

541
00:17:25,346 --> 00:17:27,646
insensitive, unlike HFS, which

542
00:17:27,646 --> 00:17:28,756
is case insensitive and

543
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:29,926
normalizing file system.

544
00:17:30,766 --> 00:17:31,756
What makes the difference?

545
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:35,346
Actually pretty simple.

546
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:37,776
In APFS, we keep the file names

547
00:17:37,896 --> 00:17:39,656
in exactly the same way you pass

548
00:17:39,656 --> 00:17:40,236
it to us.

549
00:17:41,496 --> 00:17:43,436
We compute case insensitive and

550
00:17:43,436 --> 00:17:44,756
normalization insensitive

551
00:17:45,406 --> 00:17:46,226
[inaudible] together with the

552
00:17:46,226 --> 00:17:47,786
file name and store it together.

553
00:17:49,066 --> 00:17:50,896
So when you want to do a lookup,

554
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:52,976
we perform the same hashing

555
00:17:52,976 --> 00:17:53,526
approach.

556
00:17:54,326 --> 00:17:55,746
We do hash comparison, and

557
00:17:55,746 --> 00:17:57,236
that's how we can find the name

558
00:17:57,236 --> 00:17:57,976
fast and efficient.

559
00:18:00,176 --> 00:18:04,686
Important caveat here, if you do

560
00:18:04,776 --> 00:18:06,006
a [inaudible] of directory

561
00:18:06,006 --> 00:18:07,626
structure, the names would come

562
00:18:07,626 --> 00:18:09,256
out in the order of the hash,

563
00:18:09,526 --> 00:18:13,826
not in the order of natural

564
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:16,286
lexicographical comparison like

565
00:18:16,286 --> 00:18:17,266
you normally would expect.

566
00:18:18,476 --> 00:18:19,716
We're also supporting Unicode

567
00:18:19,716 --> 00:18:22,706
9.0, unlike HFS that supports

568
00:18:22,706 --> 00:18:23,336
3.2.

569
00:18:23,896 --> 00:18:26,686
We do not allow unassigned code

570
00:18:26,686 --> 00:18:29,646
points unlike HFS, and this is

571
00:18:29,646 --> 00:18:31,036
done for the sake of future

572
00:18:31,036 --> 00:18:31,866
compatibility.

573
00:18:32,316 --> 00:18:34,286
So whenever new Unicode standard

574
00:18:34,286 --> 00:18:36,046
emerges, you can easily take

575
00:18:36,046 --> 00:18:37,676
advantage of that by replacing

576
00:18:37,676 --> 00:18:38,536
folds and tables.

577
00:18:39,716 --> 00:18:41,436
In APFS, we support canonical

578
00:18:41,436 --> 00:18:43,786
folds unlike in HFS, which

579
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:45,346
supports simplified folds, and

580
00:18:45,626 --> 00:18:47,136
canonical folding is better

581
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:48,756
because it allows you natural

582
00:18:48,756 --> 00:18:50,206
sorts and quarter in the same

583
00:18:50,206 --> 00:18:51,856
way that users expect.

584
00:18:52,366 --> 00:18:56,016
Let's talk a little bit about

585
00:18:56,016 --> 00:18:58,406
Unicode 9.0 and why that's a big

586
00:18:58,406 --> 00:18:58,646
deal.

587
00:18:58,716 --> 00:19:00,946
You might wonder, who cares

588
00:18:58,716 --> 00:19:00,946
You might wonder, who cares

589
00:19:00,946 --> 00:19:02,626
about Unicode version.

590
00:19:03,396 --> 00:19:04,276
Well, you should.

591
00:19:05,956 --> 00:19:07,956
Unicode 9.0 makes your

592
00:19:07,956 --> 00:19:09,426
applications truly global.

593
00:19:09,786 --> 00:19:13,806
For example, in Unicode 8, the

594
00:19:13,806 --> 00:19:15,406
support for Native American

595
00:19:15,406 --> 00:19:17,076
Cherokee was added, and now we

596
00:19:17,396 --> 00:19:20,006
have lower case symbols and

597
00:19:20,226 --> 00:19:21,986
capital symbols to properly

598
00:19:21,986 --> 00:19:22,516
support it.

599
00:19:23,326 --> 00:19:24,656
We support pretty much

600
00:19:24,756 --> 00:19:26,256
everything language that's

601
00:19:26,256 --> 00:19:28,126
written and understood by man,

602
00:19:28,926 --> 00:19:30,456
and if that's not global, I

603
00:19:30,456 --> 00:19:33,776
don't know what is.

604
00:19:33,996 --> 00:19:35,386
We support latest emojis.

605
00:19:36,206 --> 00:19:37,136
You might wonder why?

606
00:19:37,136 --> 00:19:41,486
Of course, because it

607
00:19:41,486 --> 00:19:42,436
[inaudible].

608
00:19:42,436 --> 00:19:46,126
And you might think, okay, HFS

609
00:19:46,156 --> 00:19:47,256
supported that too.

610
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:48,376
So what's the big deal?

611
00:19:48,756 --> 00:19:50,536
The big deal is actually

612
00:19:50,536 --> 00:19:51,196
correctness.

613
00:19:51,926 --> 00:19:55,006
HFS supported that sacrificed

614
00:19:55,046 --> 00:19:56,546
some aspects of correctness.

615
00:19:56,806 --> 00:20:00,566
Now the folds in APFS is

616
00:19:56,806 --> 00:20:00,566
Now the folds in APFS is

617
00:20:00,786 --> 00:20:02,556
completely Unicode 9.0

618
00:20:02,556 --> 00:20:06,586
compatible and for some of them,

619
00:20:06,586 --> 00:20:09,276
we just were certain rules

620
00:20:09,276 --> 00:20:11,376
succeed, let's say like capital

621
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:12,966
I was taught in Turkish language

622
00:20:13,376 --> 00:20:16,836
or sharp S in German, they would

623
00:20:16,836 --> 00:20:17,916
be capitalized properly.

624
00:20:19,026 --> 00:20:21,356
Let's talk a little bit about

625
00:20:21,356 --> 00:20:21,986
boot support.

626
00:20:22,756 --> 00:20:24,426
Of course APFS is bootable.

627
00:20:24,876 --> 00:20:26,156
You would like to boot your Mac,

628
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:27,266
right?

629
00:20:28,066 --> 00:20:29,806
And will have embedded EFT

630
00:20:29,806 --> 00:20:30,316
driver.

631
00:20:31,076 --> 00:20:32,326
What embedded means in that

632
00:20:32,326 --> 00:20:34,356
particular case is the driver

633
00:20:34,356 --> 00:20:36,256
actually baked in a file system

634
00:20:36,256 --> 00:20:37,576
for [inaudible] and it's very

635
00:20:37,576 --> 00:20:41,076
easy, can be loaded by third

636
00:20:41,076 --> 00:20:43,666
parties that support virtual

637
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:44,176
machines.

638
00:20:44,836 --> 00:20:46,306
You don't really have to

639
00:20:46,996 --> 00:20:49,266
complete the full driver and the

640
00:20:49,266 --> 00:20:50,376
standard full format.

641
00:20:50,706 --> 00:20:52,056
All you have to do is follow a

642
00:20:52,056 --> 00:20:53,156
couple of pointers from the

643
00:20:53,156 --> 00:20:55,076
superblock and load the driver

644
00:20:55,076 --> 00:20:56,996
that's baked into the volume

645
00:20:56,996 --> 00:20:57,376
itself.

646
00:20:58,546 --> 00:21:00,336
That makes it future approved so

647
00:20:58,546 --> 00:21:00,336
That makes it future approved so

648
00:21:00,336 --> 00:21:02,426
in case volume format changes

649
00:21:03,006 --> 00:21:04,976
all you have to do is just load

650
00:21:04,976 --> 00:21:06,386
new driver from the new volume.

651
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:08,746
We can boot from encrypted

652
00:21:08,746 --> 00:21:09,236
drives.

653
00:21:09,376 --> 00:21:10,946
We can boot from fusion drives.

654
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:13,316
An encryption boot actually

655
00:21:13,316 --> 00:21:14,186
makes it more secure.

656
00:21:14,806 --> 00:21:17,076
Let's talk a little bit about

657
00:21:17,076 --> 00:21:18,076
security and encryption.

658
00:21:19,476 --> 00:21:20,856
We support the same FileVault

659
00:21:20,856 --> 00:21:23,156
model that we used to.

660
00:21:24,146 --> 00:21:26,176
We have converted for existing

661
00:21:26,176 --> 00:21:28,256
FileVault volumes.

662
00:21:29,156 --> 00:21:31,636
We support the same recovery

663
00:21:31,686 --> 00:21:33,506
keys and not only will we

664
00:21:33,506 --> 00:21:34,786
support the same mechanisms, we

665
00:21:34,786 --> 00:21:36,816
will also make it compatible so

666
00:21:36,816 --> 00:21:38,476
whenever you convert, you

667
00:21:38,476 --> 00:21:40,326
preserve your existing recovery

668
00:21:40,326 --> 00:21:41,476
keys, you preserve your existing

669
00:21:41,476 --> 00:21:41,996
passwords.

670
00:21:42,156 --> 00:21:43,296
You do not have to move your

671
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:44,636
data all over the place, and

672
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:45,956
conversion doesn't take that

673
00:21:45,956 --> 00:21:46,456
much time.

674
00:21:47,586 --> 00:21:48,656
Also important point, your

675
00:21:48,656 --> 00:21:50,196
Snapshots are encrypted as well,

676
00:21:50,896 --> 00:21:52,526
and that means if you took a

677
00:21:52,526 --> 00:21:54,526
Snapshot at some point and you

678
00:21:54,526 --> 00:21:56,116
didn't have a password, and then

679
00:21:56,116 --> 00:21:57,986
you enabled encryption, your old

680
00:21:57,986 --> 00:22:00,556
data is protected as well.

681
00:21:57,986 --> 00:22:00,556
data is protected as well.

682
00:22:01,076 --> 00:22:02,506
We support Fusion drives.

683
00:22:02,506 --> 00:22:05,046
The he same features that you

684
00:22:05,046 --> 00:22:06,456
used to have before are still

685
00:22:06,456 --> 00:22:08,906
there, is write back cache and

686
00:22:08,906 --> 00:22:09,466
read cache.

687
00:22:09,746 --> 00:22:11,446
To take advantage of faster SSD

688
00:22:11,446 --> 00:22:13,476
devices, we made small

689
00:22:13,476 --> 00:22:15,616
improvement, and now all your

690
00:22:15,616 --> 00:22:17,326
metadata always going to be on

691
00:22:17,356 --> 00:22:19,796
SSD, that makes this a little

692
00:22:19,976 --> 00:22:20,806
bit faster.

693
00:22:20,806 --> 00:22:25,036
Another important feature is

694
00:22:25,036 --> 00:22:25,946
defragmentation.

695
00:22:26,826 --> 00:22:27,866
We support intelligent

696
00:22:27,866 --> 00:22:28,466
defragmenter.

697
00:22:29,456 --> 00:22:30,486
What makes it intelligent?

698
00:22:30,486 --> 00:22:31,896
It's smart enough to understand

699
00:22:32,036 --> 00:22:33,266
[inaudible] performance first to

700
00:22:33,266 --> 00:22:35,106
most were which files were most

701
00:22:35,106 --> 00:22:37,106
fragmented and it defragments

702
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:37,786
them first.

703
00:22:38,256 --> 00:22:40,526
It defragments only hard drives,

704
00:22:41,116 --> 00:22:43,626
and defragmentation happens when

705
00:22:43,626 --> 00:22:45,266
your machine is idle and it

706
00:22:45,266 --> 00:22:46,376
doesn't interfere with your

707
00:22:46,376 --> 00:22:47,506
normal workflow.

708
00:22:51,116 --> 00:22:53,746
Another interesting topic is

709
00:22:53,746 --> 00:22:54,376
Snapshots.

710
00:22:55,486 --> 00:22:57,076
Let's explore this a little bit.

711
00:22:58,216 --> 00:23:00,376
So what happens is imagine you

712
00:22:58,216 --> 00:23:00,376
So what happens is imagine you

713
00:23:00,376 --> 00:23:01,936
have a file system, a couple of

714
00:23:01,936 --> 00:23:03,966
files here, and you want to

715
00:23:03,966 --> 00:23:05,356
remember the state of that file

716
00:23:05,356 --> 00:23:06,986
system for future reference.

717
00:23:07,506 --> 00:23:11,206
What happens here, will remember

718
00:23:11,276 --> 00:23:13,206
all the references to all the

719
00:23:13,206 --> 00:23:15,596
files, create a Snapshot of the

720
00:23:15,596 --> 00:23:18,796
metadata and record it.

721
00:23:18,796 --> 00:23:19,976
If you later make [inaudible] to

722
00:23:20,076 --> 00:23:22,236
your file system, let's say you

723
00:23:22,236 --> 00:23:25,616
[inaudible] file, the same copy

724
00:23:25,616 --> 00:23:26,726
on the write technology kicks

725
00:23:26,726 --> 00:23:30,296
in, will allocate space in a new

726
00:23:30,296 --> 00:23:32,246
location, write your files.

727
00:23:32,566 --> 00:23:34,296
Your existing blocks are intact.

728
00:23:34,826 --> 00:23:36,596
Now let's say you delete a file.

729
00:23:37,806 --> 00:23:39,266
The blocks are not actually

730
00:23:39,266 --> 00:23:41,206
gone, only the reference to that

731
00:23:41,266 --> 00:23:44,456
block is gone.

732
00:23:44,606 --> 00:23:46,826
So later if you want to revert

733
00:23:46,856 --> 00:23:49,156
to a Snapshot, it will restore

734
00:23:49,156 --> 00:23:51,016
the state the way it used to be.

735
00:23:51,926 --> 00:23:53,836
For example, your [inaudible]

736
00:23:53,996 --> 00:23:56,516
will be gone, and the file that

737
00:23:56,516 --> 00:23:59,776
you deleted would be restored.

738
00:23:59,846 --> 00:24:00,946
A Snapshot [inaudible] feature.

739
00:23:59,846 --> 00:24:00,946
A Snapshot [inaudible] feature.

740
00:24:01,976 --> 00:24:02,796
They're fast to take.

741
00:24:03,576 --> 00:24:05,186
You need to be mindful that they

742
00:24:05,186 --> 00:24:06,116
occupy space.

743
00:24:07,086 --> 00:24:08,466
Because of that, creating

744
00:24:08,466 --> 00:24:10,146
Snapshots requires entitlements,

745
00:24:11,236 --> 00:24:12,286
and if you want to take

746
00:24:12,286 --> 00:24:13,016
advantage of a [inaudible],

747
00:24:13,016 --> 00:24:15,346
please talk to us.

748
00:24:15,636 --> 00:24:17,306
With that, I'm going to show you

749
00:24:17,306 --> 00:24:17,866
a demo.

750
00:24:17,866 --> 00:24:19,336
I'm going to invite Pavel Cisler

751
00:24:19,336 --> 00:24:20,646
and going to show you a demo of

752
00:24:20,646 --> 00:24:20,966
the time machine.

753
00:24:21,516 --> 00:24:25,706
[ Applause ]

754
00:24:26,206 --> 00:24:26,726
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Pavel.

755
00:24:26,726 --> 00:24:28,616
Hello everybody.

756
00:24:28,616 --> 00:24:32,556
My name is Pavel Cisler, and in

757
00:24:32,556 --> 00:24:35,016
case you wonder what's up with

758
00:24:35,186 --> 00:24:36,346
this guy's first name and the

759
00:24:36,346 --> 00:24:37,516
last guy's first name being the

760
00:24:37,516 --> 00:24:40,256
same, let me just say, we did

761
00:24:40,296 --> 00:24:42,446
some testing on clone file, and

762
00:24:42,976 --> 00:24:45,556
[laughter]-- anyway, so I manage

763
00:24:45,616 --> 00:24:46,776
the Finder and Time Machine

764
00:24:46,776 --> 00:24:47,086
teams.

765
00:24:47,086 --> 00:24:50,666
Who is a Time Machine user here?

766
00:24:51,726 --> 00:24:52,236
Wow, cool.

767
00:24:52,306 --> 00:24:53,646
A lot of you guys.

768
00:24:54,146 --> 00:24:55,606
Anybody here know about the

769
00:24:55,606 --> 00:24:56,876
mobile Time Machine feature?

770
00:24:58,136 --> 00:24:58,856
Some of you.

771
00:24:58,856 --> 00:24:59,646
Not as many.

772
00:25:00,196 --> 00:25:02,686
Okay. So I'm going to show you

773
00:25:03,006 --> 00:25:04,246
mobile Time Machine a little

774
00:25:04,646 --> 00:25:04,746
bit.

775
00:25:04,896 --> 00:25:06,576
Let me switch over to my demo

776
00:25:06,576 --> 00:25:07,236
machine here.

777
00:25:08,806 --> 00:25:11,626
So mobile Time Machine is this

778
00:25:11,626 --> 00:25:14,516
convenient part of Time Machine

779
00:25:14,516 --> 00:25:16,016
that's a feature that lets you

780
00:25:16,196 --> 00:25:19,796
back up your changes when you

781
00:25:19,796 --> 00:25:20,986
are on the go and you're away

782
00:25:20,986 --> 00:25:22,196
from your backup device, your

783
00:25:22,196 --> 00:25:24,536
time capsule, or your hard

784
00:25:24,536 --> 00:25:25,056
drive, right.

785
00:25:25,306 --> 00:25:26,516
Let's say you take your laptop

786
00:25:26,516 --> 00:25:27,186
on the road.

787
00:25:27,186 --> 00:25:30,826
Your time capsule is at home.

788
00:25:31,726 --> 00:25:33,596
Your machine still continues to

789
00:25:33,596 --> 00:25:34,976
make hourly backups through

790
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:37,346
mobile Time Machine, and that's

791
00:25:37,346 --> 00:25:38,306
a great feature, right?

792
00:25:38,306 --> 00:25:39,556
It doesn't necessarily help you

793
00:25:39,556 --> 00:25:41,016
with things like you lose your

794
00:25:41,016 --> 00:25:42,796
laptop or you lose your entire

795
00:25:42,796 --> 00:25:44,326
hard drive, but if you

796
00:25:44,326 --> 00:25:45,836
accidentally erase that

797
00:25:45,836 --> 00:25:47,116
important spreadsheet or

798
00:25:47,166 --> 00:25:50,396
whatnot, mobile Time Machine can

799
00:25:50,796 --> 00:25:51,996
save the day.

800
00:25:52,376 --> 00:25:54,576
So we have this feature since

801
00:25:54,576 --> 00:25:57,096
MacQuest and Lion, and let me

802
00:25:57,096 --> 00:25:58,156
show you real quick how it

803
00:25:58,156 --> 00:25:58,486
works.

804
00:25:58,486 --> 00:25:59,806
So here I am.

805
00:26:00,306 --> 00:26:02,406
Here's the Time Machine restore

806
00:26:02,406 --> 00:26:04,906
UI, and my laptop here, I

807
00:26:04,906 --> 00:26:06,456
brought it from my office, I'm

808
00:26:06,456 --> 00:26:07,656
not connected to any time

809
00:26:07,656 --> 00:26:09,726
capsule, and yet I still have a

810
00:26:09,836 --> 00:26:13,036
backup history here, and I can

811
00:26:13,206 --> 00:26:14,666
browse and see my files.

812
00:26:16,456 --> 00:26:18,406
And here's that secret budget

813
00:26:19,476 --> 00:26:20,866
document that I was working on

814
00:26:20,866 --> 00:26:22,096
earlier that I accidentally

815
00:26:22,096 --> 00:26:24,086
deleted, and just like that I

816
00:26:24,086 --> 00:26:28,866
restored it, and I can continue

817
00:26:28,866 --> 00:26:30,256
working on it.

818
00:26:30,516 --> 00:26:32,446
So simple feature.

819
00:26:33,106 --> 00:26:34,516
You can really save the day when

820
00:26:34,516 --> 00:26:35,616
you need it.

821
00:26:36,046 --> 00:26:40,846
Now you guys are developers, and

822
00:26:41,216 --> 00:26:43,136
you would like to know how it

823
00:26:43,136 --> 00:26:45,276
works under the hood, right?

824
00:26:45,666 --> 00:26:48,666
So on MacQuest and Lion when we

825
00:26:48,666 --> 00:26:50,076
first developed this feature, it

826
00:26:50,356 --> 00:26:51,906
was quite involved.

827
00:26:51,986 --> 00:26:55,076
It takes no less than two demons

828
00:26:55,396 --> 00:26:56,076
to do.

829
00:26:56,426 --> 00:26:58,886
One of them is a virtual file

830
00:26:58,926 --> 00:26:59,786
system overlay.

831
00:26:59,786 --> 00:27:02,456
If any of you had a chance to

832
00:26:59,786 --> 00:27:02,456
If any of you had a chance to

833
00:27:02,456 --> 00:27:03,676
work on something like that, you

834
00:27:03,676 --> 00:27:04,996
know it's pretty tricky.

835
00:27:05,386 --> 00:27:06,546
So it's literally tens of

836
00:27:06,546 --> 00:27:08,596
thousands of lines of code.

837
00:27:08,986 --> 00:27:11,576
So for macOS 10 High Sierra, the

838
00:27:11,836 --> 00:27:14,316
Time Machine team was super busy

839
00:27:14,876 --> 00:27:16,086
deleting all this code.

840
00:27:16,526 --> 00:27:19,786
So what we did, we reimplemented

841
00:27:19,786 --> 00:27:21,326
mobile Time Machine on top of

842
00:27:21,326 --> 00:27:23,306
APFS Snapshots, and that's

843
00:27:23,306 --> 00:27:25,036
actually what I just demoed to

844
00:27:25,036 --> 00:27:25,416
you here.

845
00:27:26,326 --> 00:27:28,556
So never mind this UI.

846
00:27:28,556 --> 00:27:30,626
Let me open up Terminal and show

847
00:27:30,626 --> 00:27:33,656
you some of it under the hood.

848
00:27:34,046 --> 00:27:35,866
When we talk about Snapshots,

849
00:27:36,626 --> 00:27:37,966
what do they look like?

850
00:27:37,966 --> 00:27:39,756
What do they feel like?

851
00:27:39,756 --> 00:27:41,276
Well, they feel very much like

852
00:27:41,396 --> 00:27:44,896
any other volume, and as such,

853
00:27:44,966 --> 00:27:47,526
you can inspect them using a

854
00:27:47,526 --> 00:27:50,376
variety of volume management

855
00:27:50,376 --> 00:27:50,746
tools.

856
00:27:51,136 --> 00:27:53,056
My favorite is Mount, so let me

857
00:27:53,056 --> 00:27:54,916
go ahead and type Mount here.

858
00:27:55,056 --> 00:27:57,906
Without any arguments, if you do

859
00:27:57,906 --> 00:27:59,436
that, it lists all your disks,

860
00:27:59,946 --> 00:28:01,726
and you can see here that at the

861
00:27:59,946 --> 00:28:01,726
and you can see here that at the

862
00:28:01,726 --> 00:28:06,046
top there's my slash, there's a

863
00:28:06,046 --> 00:28:07,106
swap space here.

864
00:28:07,426 --> 00:28:09,246
A bunch of other common volumes,

865
00:28:09,246 --> 00:28:10,726
but then there's these funny

866
00:28:11,186 --> 00:28:14,006
volumes that are mounted at a

867
00:28:14,006 --> 00:28:15,986
mount point that continues to

868
00:28:15,986 --> 00:28:17,816
[inaudible] that Time Machine in

869
00:28:17,816 --> 00:28:19,956
the path, and there's also this

870
00:28:20,016 --> 00:28:22,626
strange time stamp.

871
00:28:22,866 --> 00:28:25,596
Well, these are all APFS

872
00:28:25,596 --> 00:28:28,796
Snapshots that represent the

873
00:28:28,796 --> 00:28:30,836
individual hourly mobile Time

874
00:28:30,836 --> 00:28:32,496
Machine backups, right.

875
00:28:32,756 --> 00:28:34,046
Each of them is a Snapshot.

876
00:28:34,046 --> 00:28:35,476
Each of them mounted as a

877
00:28:35,476 --> 00:28:35,966
volume.

878
00:28:36,216 --> 00:28:37,786
So if I go into the Time Machine

879
00:28:38,566 --> 00:28:41,326
restore UI on the right here,

880
00:28:41,326 --> 00:28:42,056
that's what they are.

881
00:28:43,146 --> 00:28:44,836
So let me go back.

882
00:28:45,146 --> 00:28:48,246
So these Snapshots aren't

883
00:28:48,246 --> 00:28:51,186
actually mounted all the time.

884
00:28:51,186 --> 00:28:52,626
They get mounted [inaudible], so

885
00:28:52,626 --> 00:28:54,036
they don't have to stick around.

886
00:28:54,036 --> 00:28:55,946
Mobile Time Machine only kicks

887
00:28:56,006 --> 00:28:57,836
them in when it needs them and

888
00:28:58,296 --> 00:28:58,756
[inaudible] them after.

889
00:28:58,756 --> 00:29:02,436
So let me show you how that,

890
00:28:58,756 --> 00:29:02,436
So let me show you how that,

891
00:29:02,436 --> 00:29:03,796
what happens when you do that.

892
00:29:03,796 --> 00:29:06,076
So I'm going to simulate what

893
00:29:06,076 --> 00:29:07,686
mobile Time Machine would do

894
00:29:07,686 --> 00:29:09,726
when it's done with Snapshots

895
00:29:09,726 --> 00:29:10,786
and unmount them all.

896
00:29:10,786 --> 00:29:12,756
I'll use this command line too

897
00:29:12,756 --> 00:29:15,506
called tmutil with a verb called

898
00:29:15,506 --> 00:29:18,106
unmount local Snapshots.

899
00:29:18,176 --> 00:29:20,346
And it's going ahead and

900
00:29:20,346 --> 00:29:21,746
unmounting all the Snapshots.

901
00:29:22,006 --> 00:29:25,236
So now if I entered the restore

902
00:29:25,236 --> 00:29:28,026
UI, it actually has to remount

903
00:29:28,066 --> 00:29:28,716
them, right.

904
00:29:28,716 --> 00:29:31,616
So that was super quick, right.

905
00:29:32,146 --> 00:29:34,826
So it just mounted what, like

906
00:29:34,826 --> 00:29:37,656
some 20 volumes just like that.

907
00:29:37,716 --> 00:29:39,186
So that's fantastic.

908
00:29:39,636 --> 00:29:42,386
Now, I'm going to go ahead and

909
00:29:42,506 --> 00:29:43,756
do a backup.

910
00:29:43,756 --> 00:29:45,066
Mobile Time Machine backs up

911
00:29:45,206 --> 00:29:45,906
once an hour.

912
00:29:45,906 --> 00:29:47,476
It wakes up and creates a

913
00:29:47,476 --> 00:29:48,056
Snapshot.

914
00:29:48,296 --> 00:29:49,856
We're not going to sit around

915
00:29:49,856 --> 00:29:51,396
for an hour here and wait for

916
00:29:51,396 --> 00:29:51,546
that.

917
00:29:51,606 --> 00:29:53,456
So I'll use a tool again.

918
00:29:54,016 --> 00:30:00,336
Tmutil Snapshot and it just

919
00:29:54,016 --> 00:30:00,336
Tmutil Snapshot and it just

920
00:30:00,586 --> 00:30:02,146
backed up, right.

921
00:30:02,446 --> 00:30:05,026
So you saw it took a little less

922
00:30:05,086 --> 00:30:07,166
than a second to back up the

923
00:30:07,216 --> 00:30:08,656
entire machine.

924
00:30:09,006 --> 00:30:09,876
So that's fantastic.

925
00:30:10,516 --> 00:30:14,036
[ Applause ]

926
00:30:14,536 --> 00:30:16,856
So I'm going to go ahead and

927
00:30:17,346 --> 00:30:18,796
show you that it actually

928
00:30:18,866 --> 00:30:19,056
worked.

929
00:30:19,056 --> 00:30:21,566
I'm going to accidentally delete

930
00:30:21,566 --> 00:30:22,476
some data here.

931
00:30:23,996 --> 00:30:27,786
Oh no, what did I do, my

932
00:30:27,786 --> 00:30:28,616
important movie.

933
00:30:28,616 --> 00:30:30,626
And I'm going to go back into

934
00:30:30,626 --> 00:30:33,526
the restore UI and, ah, whew,

935
00:30:33,916 --> 00:30:36,476
there it is, and restore it.

936
00:30:36,866 --> 00:30:39,406
So again mobile Time Machine

937
00:30:39,406 --> 00:30:39,976
saves the day.

938
00:30:40,846 --> 00:30:44,486
So how come this was so fast?

939
00:30:44,646 --> 00:30:46,376
Well, as the other Pavel

940
00:30:46,376 --> 00:30:48,546
explained to you, snapshotting

941
00:30:48,776 --> 00:30:50,856
is a copy and write technology,

942
00:30:50,856 --> 00:30:53,346
so you basically just grab

943
00:30:53,346 --> 00:30:56,036
references to your data, and the

944
00:30:56,036 --> 00:30:57,616
actual copying happens later if

945
00:30:57,616 --> 00:30:59,816
there's an actual change.

946
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:00,576
It's deferred.

947
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:00,576
It's deferred.

948
00:31:00,576 --> 00:31:01,536
It's lazy, right.

949
00:31:02,056 --> 00:31:03,586
So much more faster, much more

950
00:31:03,586 --> 00:31:03,996
efficient.

951
00:31:05,606 --> 00:31:07,546
So the other thing I'm going to

952
00:31:07,546 --> 00:31:09,216
point out here is that this

953
00:31:09,216 --> 00:31:10,606
movie that I just restored is

954
00:31:10,606 --> 00:31:12,886
actually pretty big.

955
00:31:12,966 --> 00:31:15,196
It's a movie of our last year's

956
00:31:15,886 --> 00:31:16,236
talk.

957
00:31:16,846 --> 00:31:20,926
It's 1.1 gigs, and the old

958
00:31:20,926 --> 00:31:23,286
mobile Time Machine had certain

959
00:31:23,286 --> 00:31:25,446
limits, like it couldn't back up

960
00:31:25,446 --> 00:31:27,876
changes to files over 20

961
00:31:27,876 --> 00:31:28,396
megabytes.

962
00:31:28,396 --> 00:31:30,066
Well, all these limits are gone

963
00:31:30,626 --> 00:31:31,256
now.

964
00:31:31,256 --> 00:31:32,966
Mobile Time Machine on top of

965
00:31:32,966 --> 00:31:36,046
APFS Snapshots will back up

966
00:31:36,156 --> 00:31:37,686
anything in a very speedy way

967
00:31:37,686 --> 00:31:39,416
and efficiently.

968
00:31:39,536 --> 00:31:42,116
So that's mobile Time Machine on

969
00:31:42,116 --> 00:31:43,376
top of APFS Snapshots.

970
00:31:44,526 --> 00:31:44,996
All right.

971
00:31:44,996 --> 00:31:47,896
S otherwise that, I'm going to

972
00:31:49,106 --> 00:31:51,096
switch back to the slides and

973
00:31:51,096 --> 00:31:54,146
Pavel will tell you more about

974
00:31:54,146 --> 00:31:56,056
some of the APIs we've used to

975
00:31:56,106 --> 00:31:56,756
make this happen.

976
00:31:56,756 --> 00:31:57,276
Thank you everyone.

977
00:31:58,516 --> 00:32:04,676

[ Background Noise ]

981
00:32:11,476 --> 00:32:13,486
So you might wonder what about

982
00:32:13,486 --> 00:32:15,416
APIs, how to take advantage of

983
00:32:15,416 --> 00:32:15,856
all that.

984
00:32:16,646 --> 00:32:21,006
So good news is if you program

985
00:32:21,006 --> 00:32:22,076
[inaudible] like you probably

986
00:32:22,076 --> 00:32:25,896
should, it's all taken care of

987
00:32:26,946 --> 00:32:27,536
for you.

988
00:32:28,246 --> 00:32:31,166
The copyItem API automatically

989
00:32:31,166 --> 00:32:33,216
takes advantage of API files

990
00:32:34,116 --> 00:32:35,016
clone feature.

991
00:32:36,116 --> 00:32:37,346
How that happens behind the

992
00:32:37,346 --> 00:32:39,246
scenes we see if volume is

993
00:32:39,246 --> 00:32:41,946
compatible with cloning, and we

994
00:32:41,996 --> 00:32:43,816
take clones automatically as you

995
00:32:43,816 --> 00:32:44,756
copy the files.

996
00:32:46,176 --> 00:32:47,736
There's also replaceItem API,

997
00:32:47,986 --> 00:32:48,946
which takes care of [inaudible]

998
00:32:48,946 --> 00:32:51,596
save save, again automatically

999
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:54,286
you don't have to do anything

1000
00:32:54,286 --> 00:32:56,366
for that.

1001
00:32:56,626 --> 00:32:57,846
There are a couple of guidelines

1002
00:32:57,896 --> 00:32:59,916
that I want to remind, good

1003
00:33:00,016 --> 00:33:02,876
practices, and important points.

1004
00:33:03,576 --> 00:33:05,656
In particular, [inaudible] data

1005
00:33:05,856 --> 00:33:06,766
is duplicated.

1006
00:33:06,796 --> 00:33:08,636
We announced that a year ago,

1007
00:33:09,456 --> 00:33:11,116
and not only is it duplicated,

1008
00:33:11,856 --> 00:33:13,766
it's also not going to work with

1009
00:33:13,766 --> 00:33:14,376
API files.

1010
00:33:15,456 --> 00:33:17,666
Instead of that, if you want to

1011
00:33:17,936 --> 00:33:19,586
take advantage of [inaudible]

1012
00:33:19,586 --> 00:33:21,276
file swap, [inaudible] save

1013
00:33:21,276 --> 00:33:23,626
save, use new API which is

1014
00:33:23,626 --> 00:33:25,376
called rename underscore np.

1015
00:33:26,086 --> 00:33:29,876
Also, please do not use carbon

1016
00:33:29,876 --> 00:33:30,336
APIs.

1017
00:33:30,716 --> 00:33:31,696
Again that's [inaudible].

1018
00:33:32,016 --> 00:33:33,526
It works in compatibility mode

1019
00:33:33,526 --> 00:33:34,316
with API files.

1020
00:33:34,546 --> 00:33:35,866
It's going to be much slower.

1021
00:33:36,236 --> 00:33:38,196
It's [inaudible] the file

1022
00:33:38,196 --> 00:33:38,626
system.

1023
00:33:38,926 --> 00:33:41,706
Instead, use foundation APIs.

1024
00:33:42,636 --> 00:33:46,196
If you want a little bit lower

1025
00:33:46,196 --> 00:33:48,716
layer, you can use [inaudible]

1026
00:33:48,716 --> 00:33:51,366
copyfile with copyfile function

1027
00:33:51,686 --> 00:33:53,186
that supports copyfile clone

1028
00:33:53,186 --> 00:33:53,556
flag.

1029
00:33:53,736 --> 00:33:57,346
There are a couple of caveats

1030
00:33:57,656 --> 00:33:59,196
for that [inaudible] preview.

1031
00:34:00,276 --> 00:34:02,206
In particular, we're not going

1032
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:03,906
to automatically upgrade

1033
00:34:03,956 --> 00:34:06,216
HDD-based file systems.

1034
00:34:07,056 --> 00:34:07,776
We're still working on

1035
00:34:07,776 --> 00:34:11,556
performance, and if you'd like

1036
00:34:11,606 --> 00:34:14,826
to get bootable APFS, it's not

1037
00:34:14,826 --> 00:34:15,856
enough just to run the

1038
00:34:15,856 --> 00:34:16,366
converter.

1039
00:34:16,656 --> 00:34:17,676
You have to go through the

1040
00:34:17,676 --> 00:34:18,156
installer.

1041
00:34:18,346 --> 00:34:24,076
So APFS is coming to macOS.

1042
00:34:24,166 --> 00:34:25,025
It's here.

1043
00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:27,406
In fact, it's supported file

1044
00:34:27,406 --> 00:34:27,826
system.

1045
00:34:28,815 --> 00:34:30,306
It supports Fusion drives.

1046
00:34:30,306 --> 00:34:32,136
It will support native

1047
00:34:32,136 --> 00:34:32,706
encryption.

1048
00:34:33,016 --> 00:34:34,536
Space sharing is an awesome

1049
00:34:34,536 --> 00:34:34,896
feature.

1050
00:34:35,956 --> 00:34:37,315
There are clone files and

1051
00:34:37,446 --> 00:34:39,376
snapshots that are going to make

1052
00:34:39,376 --> 00:34:40,966
your storage more efficient and

1053
00:34:41,005 --> 00:34:41,396
faster.

1054
00:34:42,096 --> 00:34:44,146
Please test your apps as you

1055
00:34:44,146 --> 00:34:45,886
just noticed there are a couple

1056
00:34:45,886 --> 00:34:47,485
of important differences between

1057
00:34:47,485 --> 00:34:48,666
HFS and APFS.

1058
00:34:48,826 --> 00:34:49,956
We would like your apps to be
