[ Applause ]

2
00:00:31,766 --> 00:00:32,305
&gt;&gt; Jeff Tu: Good afternoon,

3
00:00:32,305 --> 00:00:32,746
everyone.

4
00:00:32,876 --> 00:00:34,116
I'd like to welcome to you part

5
00:00:34,116 --> 00:00:35,996
two to Advances in Networking, a

6
00:00:35,996 --> 00:00:37,356
continuation of the session from

7
00:00:37,356 --> 00:00:38,166
the past hour.

8
00:00:38,956 --> 00:00:40,466
My name is Jeff Tu, and I'll be

9
00:00:40,466 --> 00:00:41,326
taking you through the first

10
00:00:41,326 --> 00:00:41,500
topic.

11
00:00:44,516 --> 00:00:45,936
In this session we'll discuss

12
00:00:45,936 --> 00:00:47,856
new URLSession developer API and

13
00:00:47,856 --> 00:00:49,736
enhancements, networking best

14
00:00:49,736 --> 00:00:51,386
practices, and other important

15
00:00:51,386 --> 00:00:53,000
technology areas in networking.

16
00:00:56,066 --> 00:00:57,516
Our first topic is new

17
00:00:57,516 --> 00:00:58,446
URLSession API.

18
00:00:59,386 --> 00:01:02,556
But before that, I'd like to

19
00:00:59,386 --> 00:01:02,556
But before that, I'd like to

20
00:01:02,556 --> 00:01:04,086
review the underlying API we'll

21
00:01:04,086 --> 00:01:05,396
be talking about, which is

22
00:01:05,396 --> 00:01:06,226
URLSession.

23
00:01:07,106 --> 00:01:09,086
URLSession is an easy-to-use API

24
00:01:09,206 --> 00:01:11,176
for networking introduced in iOS

25
00:01:11,176 --> 00:01:12,676
7 and OS X Mavericks.

26
00:01:13,736 --> 00:01:15,236
URLSession supports networking

27
00:01:15,266 --> 00:01:18,816
protocols like HTTP/2; HTTP/1.1;

28
00:01:19,156 --> 00:01:21,646
FTP; and custom streams with an

29
00:01:21,646 --> 00:01:23,756
overall emphasis on URL loading.

30
00:01:24,126 --> 00:01:26,976
If you provide it an HTTPS URL,

31
00:01:27,276 --> 00:01:29,096
it also automatically provides

32
00:01:29,096 --> 00:01:30,906
the encryption and decryption of

33
00:01:30,906 --> 00:01:32,636
data between you and the web

34
00:01:32,636 --> 00:01:32,956
server.

35
00:01:34,286 --> 00:01:35,726
Last year we deprecated

36
00:01:35,866 --> 00:01:36,846
NSURLConnection API.

37
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:39,476
So we encourage any new app

38
00:01:39,476 --> 00:01:40,596
development to occur with

39
00:01:40,596 --> 00:01:41,416
URLSession.

40
00:01:42,136 --> 00:01:43,486
For more information on

41
00:01:43,486 --> 00:01:44,946
URLSession, I encourage you to

42
00:01:44,946 --> 00:01:47,356
review past WWDC sessions and

43
00:01:47,356 --> 00:01:48,726
other online documentation.

44
00:01:51,936 --> 00:01:53,336
Recall that there are different

45
00:01:53,336 --> 00:01:54,916
kinds of URLSession objects that

46
00:01:54,916 --> 00:01:55,576
you can create.

47
00:01:56,446 --> 00:01:57,896
The basic object you can create

48
00:01:57,966 --> 00:01:59,556
is a default configuration

49
00:01:59,676 --> 00:02:01,126
URLSession object.

50
00:01:59,676 --> 00:02:01,126
URLSession object.

51
00:02:02,096 --> 00:02:03,786
Default sessions have a behavior

52
00:02:03,906 --> 00:02:05,616
where a task either fetches a

53
00:02:05,616 --> 00:02:07,896
URL immediately; or if the

54
00:02:07,896 --> 00:02:09,036
device can't connect to the web

55
00:02:09,106 --> 00:02:10,616
server, fails immediately.

56
00:02:11,646 --> 00:02:13,106
URL loads can fail because the

57
00:02:13,106 --> 00:02:14,316
device isn't connected to the

58
00:02:14,316 --> 00:02:15,686
Internet or if the server you're

59
00:02:15,686 --> 00:02:16,826
trying to reach happens to be

60
00:02:16,826 --> 00:02:17,296
down.

61
00:02:18,236 --> 00:02:19,386
Those are just a couple of

62
00:02:19,386 --> 00:02:19,946
examples.

63
00:02:21,146 --> 00:02:22,836
Background URLSession objects,

64
00:02:22,836 --> 00:02:24,506
on the other hand, don't have

65
00:02:24,506 --> 00:02:25,656
this immediate fetch or fail

66
00:02:25,656 --> 00:02:27,256
behavior but are scheduled out

67
00:02:27,256 --> 00:02:28,976
of process and continually

68
00:02:28,976 --> 00:02:30,096
monitored for network

69
00:02:30,346 --> 00:02:31,626
connectivity to the server.

70
00:02:34,436 --> 00:02:36,386
There are more examples of a

71
00:02:36,386 --> 00:02:37,926
URLSession task failing because

72
00:02:37,926 --> 00:02:38,876
of bad connectivity.

73
00:02:39,816 --> 00:02:40,736
You might have no Internet

74
00:02:40,736 --> 00:02:42,556
connection, you might be in a

75
00:02:42,606 --> 00:02:43,666
theatre with your device in

76
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:45,056
Airplane Mode or it should be in

77
00:02:45,056 --> 00:02:45,626
Airplane Mode.

78
00:02:46,756 --> 00:02:47,776
Perhaps you have a session

79
00:02:47,776 --> 00:02:49,196
object where you've disallowed

80
00:02:49,196 --> 00:02:51,246
cell usage but the user only has

81
00:02:51,246 --> 00:02:52,036
cell connectivity.

82
00:02:52,986 --> 00:02:54,236
Or the server might only be

83
00:02:54,236 --> 00:02:55,726
accessible behind a VPN and the

84
00:02:55,726 --> 00:02:57,406
admin recently changed VPN

85
00:02:57,406 --> 00:02:58,000
access.

86
00:03:01,206 --> 00:03:02,686
How do you as an app developer

87
00:03:02,686 --> 00:03:03,896
deal with a network load that

88
00:03:03,976 --> 00:03:04,476
fails?

89
00:03:05,696 --> 00:03:08,366
In the past, we've advised you

90
00:03:08,366 --> 00:03:10,096
to use the SCNetworkReachability

91
00:03:10,096 --> 00:03:11,576
API to monitor when you might

92
00:03:11,576 --> 00:03:13,116
have connectivity again to the

93
00:03:13,176 --> 00:03:13,566
server.

94
00:03:14,406 --> 00:03:16,006
Other approaches are polling

95
00:03:16,006 --> 00:03:17,856
every set period of time or

96
00:03:17,856 --> 00:03:19,636
depending on the user to tap or

97
00:03:19,636 --> 00:03:21,186
drag to refresh the UI.

98
00:03:22,246 --> 00:03:23,786
The problem is that these

99
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:25,196
approaches add complexity to

100
00:03:25,196 --> 00:03:26,646
your apps and aren't always

101
00:03:26,646 --> 00:03:27,146
effective.

102
00:03:28,226 --> 00:03:30,256
SCNetworkReachability only tells

103
00:03:30,256 --> 00:03:31,606
you that you might be able to

104
00:03:31,606 --> 00:03:32,936
reach the server, not that you

105
00:03:32,936 --> 00:03:33,276
will.

106
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:35,616
You, our developers, have been

107
00:03:35,616 --> 00:03:37,000
asking for an easier solution.

108
00:03:39,536 --> 00:03:41,066
Wouldn't it be easier to say,

109
00:03:41,066 --> 00:03:42,956
then, "Please fetch me this

110
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:44,746
resource when the network is

111
00:03:44,746 --> 00:03:45,366
available"?

112
00:03:48,756 --> 00:03:50,016
We're happy to tell you about a

113
00:03:50,016 --> 00:03:51,126
new feature that lets you do

114
00:03:51,126 --> 00:03:51,436
this.

115
00:03:51,886 --> 00:03:53,396
We call this the URLSession

116
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:55,036
Adaptable Connectivity API.

117
00:03:56,246 --> 00:03:56,486
This --

118
00:03:57,516 --> 00:04:01,936
[ Applause ]

119
00:03:57,516 --> 00:04:01,936
[ Applause ]

120
00:04:02,436 --> 00:04:04,706
This API is available now on all

121
00:04:04,706 --> 00:04:05,256
platforms.

122
00:04:07,476 --> 00:04:09,626
By opting into this API, you

123
00:04:09,626 --> 00:04:11,316
tell URLSession that in the

124
00:04:11,316 --> 00:04:13,156
event that the task would fail

125
00:04:13,156 --> 00:04:13,936
because of a lack of

126
00:04:13,936 --> 00:04:15,746
connectivity that it should wait

127
00:04:15,746 --> 00:04:17,176
for a connection to the server

128
00:04:17,176 --> 00:04:18,416
instead of failing.

129
00:04:21,546 --> 00:04:22,436
How do you opt in?

130
00:04:22,766 --> 00:04:24,286
There's a new boolean property

131
00:04:24,286 --> 00:04:26,056
called waitsForConnectivity.

132
00:04:26,826 --> 00:04:28,296
Set this to true, and then you

133
00:04:28,296 --> 00:04:29,246
get the new behavior.

134
00:04:30,226 --> 00:04:31,746
I'd like to repeat what this

135
00:04:31,746 --> 00:04:32,496
property does.

136
00:04:33,056 --> 00:04:34,566
You go from the default behavior

137
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:36,466
of load it now or fail now if I

138
00:04:36,466 --> 00:04:38,976
can't connect to load it now,

139
00:04:39,306 --> 00:04:40,366
but if I can't and would have

140
00:04:40,366 --> 00:04:42,206
failed because of a lack of

141
00:04:42,206 --> 00:04:44,146
connectivity, try again when I

142
00:04:44,146 --> 00:04:45,426
get a real chance to talk to the

143
00:04:45,426 --> 00:04:45,816
server.

144
00:04:46,526 --> 00:04:48,896
The API also waits when it

145
00:04:48,896 --> 00:04:50,556
encounters DNS failures as well

146
00:04:50,686 --> 00:04:52,426
since one network's DNS service

147
00:04:52,426 --> 00:04:53,986
might fail to resolve but

148
00:04:53,986 --> 00:04:55,946
another one may not.

149
00:04:56,576 --> 00:04:59,046
Please note that this boolean is

150
00:04:59,046 --> 00:05:00,776
a no op for background sessions,

151
00:04:59,046 --> 00:05:00,776
a no op for background sessions,

152
00:05:00,776 --> 00:05:02,916
as background URLSession objects

153
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:04,366
get this behavior automatically.

154
00:05:04,986 --> 00:05:05,966
We'll tell you later in this

155
00:05:05,966 --> 00:05:09,000
hour more about the differences.

156
00:05:11,016 --> 00:05:12,526
You may be wondering, "Can my

157
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:14,146
code get a notification if it's

158
00:05:14,146 --> 00:05:15,276
in this waiting state?"

159
00:05:15,376 --> 00:05:18,556
You might want to have the app

160
00:05:18,556 --> 00:05:19,836
present other behavior while

161
00:05:19,836 --> 00:05:20,686
it's waiting to connect.

162
00:05:20,936 --> 00:05:22,826
For example, having an offline

163
00:05:22,826 --> 00:05:24,376
browsing mode or a mode that

164
00:05:24,376 --> 00:05:25,946
operates when the user is only

165
00:05:25,946 --> 00:05:26,660
on cell.

166
00:05:29,436 --> 00:05:30,786
If you would like to know when

167
00:05:30,786 --> 00:05:32,076
your app is in this waiting

168
00:05:32,076 --> 00:05:33,766
state, you can optionally

169
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:35,246
implement the URLSession

170
00:05:35,286 --> 00:05:37,176
taskIsWaitingForConnectivity

171
00:05:37,176 --> 00:05:38,086
delegate method.

172
00:05:39,106 --> 00:05:40,446
Note that this delegate method

173
00:05:40,446 --> 00:05:42,776
is only called if you've opted

174
00:05:42,776 --> 00:05:43,866
into the waitsForConnectivity

175
00:05:43,866 --> 00:05:45,096
property with a true value.

176
00:05:45,806 --> 00:05:47,446
If you've done this, the

177
00:05:47,446 --> 00:05:48,636
delegate method itself will be

178
00:05:48,636 --> 00:05:50,386
called only one time or not at

179
00:05:50,386 --> 00:05:52,256
all if the task never had to

180
00:05:53,016 --> 00:05:53,126
wait.

181
00:05:56,896 --> 00:05:58,566
We recommend that your apps

182
00:05:58,706 --> 00:05:59,726
always opt into the

183
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:01,046
waitsForConnectivity property.

184
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:01,046
waitsForConnectivity property.

185
00:06:01,816 --> 00:06:03,306
This is because even when you

186
00:06:03,306 --> 00:06:05,386
opt in, the task will still try

187
00:06:05,386 --> 00:06:06,156
to run immediately.

188
00:06:06,696 --> 00:06:08,106
The task will only wait if it

189
00:06:08,106 --> 00:06:09,146
can't connect to the server.

190
00:06:09,986 --> 00:06:11,146
There are rare exceptions to

191
00:06:11,146 --> 00:06:12,126
opting into the property,

192
00:06:12,126 --> 00:06:12,396
though.

193
00:06:13,126 --> 00:06:14,366
For example, if you had a

194
00:06:14,366 --> 00:06:15,796
URLSession task whose purpose

195
00:06:15,796 --> 00:06:16,916
was to buy stock at market

196
00:06:16,916 --> 00:06:18,516
price, you'd want that to run

197
00:06:18,516 --> 00:06:20,476
now or fail now and not wait

198
00:06:20,476 --> 00:06:22,746
until you had an Internet

199
00:06:23,066 --> 00:06:23,576
connection.

200
00:06:24,556 --> 00:06:26,656
I'd also like to mention that

201
00:06:26,656 --> 00:06:27,376
when you opt into

202
00:06:27,376 --> 00:06:29,236
waitsForConnectivity, the

203
00:06:29,236 --> 00:06:30,796
timeout interval for request

204
00:06:31,086 --> 00:06:33,186
timer starts only after you've

205
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:34,256
connected to the server.

206
00:06:35,066 --> 00:06:36,756
Timeout interval for resource,

207
00:06:36,756 --> 00:06:38,456
however, is always respected.

208
00:06:39,026 --> 00:06:43,746
Let's summarize how we would use

209
00:06:43,746 --> 00:06:45,326
the API and then go through a

210
00:06:45,326 --> 00:06:45,976
code example.

211
00:06:47,326 --> 00:06:48,956
The main thing is to opt into

212
00:06:48,956 --> 00:06:49,856
the waitsForConnectivity

213
00:06:49,856 --> 00:06:50,336
property.

214
00:06:50,956 --> 00:06:52,286
You would create and resume the

215
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:53,646
URLSessionTask as before.

216
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:56,216
If the device can't connect to

217
00:06:56,216 --> 00:06:57,946
the server, we'd call a delegate

218
00:06:57,946 --> 00:06:59,656
callback if you implemented it

219
00:06:59,796 --> 00:07:00,636
and only once.

220
00:06:59,796 --> 00:07:00,636
and only once.

221
00:07:02,116 --> 00:07:03,756
All other URLSession methods are

222
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:05,436
still called same as before.

223
00:07:06,496 --> 00:07:08,016
Remember, though, that this API

224
00:07:08,016 --> 00:07:09,316
only has an effect for

225
00:07:09,316 --> 00:07:10,660
non-background sessions.

226
00:07:14,636 --> 00:07:15,826
Let's go through a sample code.

227
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:18,846
First create a session

228
00:07:18,846 --> 00:07:20,756
configuration object and make

229
00:07:20,756 --> 00:07:24,886
one for default session type.

230
00:07:25,086 --> 00:07:25,756
Opt into the

231
00:07:25,756 --> 00:07:27,056
waitsForConnectivity property.

232
00:07:29,536 --> 00:07:31,286
Create the session object and

233
00:07:31,286 --> 00:07:32,736
set the URL you want to load.

234
00:07:33,366 --> 00:07:37,276
Use the session object to create

235
00:07:37,276 --> 00:07:38,046
a task object.

236
00:07:41,976 --> 00:07:43,606
And finally, resume the task to

237
00:07:43,606 --> 00:07:44,000
get it started.

238
00:07:50,156 --> 00:07:51,346
Even with adaptable

239
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:52,936
connectivity, your request may

240
00:07:52,936 --> 00:07:54,396
still fail for other reasons.

241
00:07:55,126 --> 00:07:56,736
For example, you could connect

242
00:07:56,736 --> 00:07:58,846
to the server, but a new data

243
00:07:58,846 --> 00:08:00,856
center employee might unplug a

244
00:07:58,846 --> 00:08:00,856
center employee might unplug a

245
00:08:00,856 --> 00:08:02,016
server, cause the network

246
00:08:02,016 --> 00:08:03,086
connection to drop, and all your

247
00:08:03,086 --> 00:08:03,946
apps on your phone might

248
00:08:04,086 --> 00:08:04,660
disappear.

249
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:08,416
Or your device connects to the

250
00:08:08,466 --> 00:08:10,826
server and sends an HTTP

251
00:08:10,826 --> 00:08:12,226
request, but there's so much

252
00:08:12,226 --> 00:08:13,476
traffic that the request times

253
00:08:13,476 --> 00:08:13,706
out.

254
00:08:14,926 --> 00:08:16,446
For situations like these, we'd

255
00:08:16,446 --> 00:08:17,536
like you to consult online

256
00:08:17,536 --> 00:08:19,696
resources that go into more

257
00:08:19,696 --> 00:08:20,776
detail on what you can do.

258
00:08:22,136 --> 00:08:23,336
Retrying network loads in a

259
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,786
tight loop, though, is almost

260
00:08:24,786 --> 00:08:25,746
always a bad idea.

261
00:08:25,876 --> 00:08:30,876
You asked for a better way to

262
00:08:30,876 --> 00:08:32,116
load network resources.

263
00:08:32,525 --> 00:08:33,846
Better than polling for network

264
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:35,556
connectivity to the server and

265
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:36,775
better than reachability API

266
00:08:36,905 --> 00:08:37,876
that won't guarantee a

267
00:08:37,876 --> 00:08:38,905
connection to the server.

268
00:08:40,265 --> 00:08:42,596
Let URLSession do the work for

269
00:08:42,596 --> 00:08:42,836
you.

270
00:08:43,626 --> 00:08:44,476
Opt into the

271
00:08:44,476 --> 00:08:46,116
waitsForConnectivity Adaptable

272
00:08:46,116 --> 00:08:47,056
Connectivity API.

273
00:08:47,686 --> 00:08:49,746
If you opt in, the request will

274
00:08:49,746 --> 00:08:51,516
still run immediately with no

275
00:08:51,516 --> 00:08:53,786
performance penalty and only

276
00:08:53,786 --> 00:08:55,056
wait if you can't connect to the

277
00:08:55,056 --> 00:08:55,476
server.

278
00:08:56,366 --> 00:08:57,756
Once it can connect, your

279
00:08:57,756 --> 00:08:59,396
URLSession task behaves just

280
00:08:59,396 --> 00:09:00,106
like it did before.

281
00:08:59,396 --> 00:09:00,106
like it did before.

282
00:09:02,326 --> 00:09:03,566
Continuing our theme of what's

283
00:09:03,566 --> 00:09:05,126
new, I'd like to pass the mic to

284
00:09:05,126 --> 00:09:06,336
my colleague, Jeff Jenkins.

285
00:09:07,516 --> 00:09:13,016
[ Applause ]

286
00:09:13,516 --> 00:09:14,166
&gt;&gt; Jeff Jenkins: Thanks, Jeff.

287
00:09:15,586 --> 00:09:16,646
Well, good afternoon.

288
00:09:16,686 --> 00:09:17,836
Hope you guys are having a great

289
00:09:17,836 --> 00:09:18,736
WWDC.

290
00:09:18,736 --> 00:09:20,556
And I'm exciting to be here and

291
00:09:20,556 --> 00:09:21,966
thrilled to talk to you a little

292
00:09:21,966 --> 00:09:24,296
bit more about some enhancements

293
00:09:24,296 --> 00:09:27,946
we've made to the URLSessionTask

294
00:09:28,196 --> 00:09:29,000
API.

295
00:09:32,106 --> 00:09:33,606
Now, first I want to spend a

296
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:34,956
little bit of time talking about

297
00:09:34,956 --> 00:09:37,056
background URLSession.

298
00:09:37,056 --> 00:09:38,036
We haven't talked a whole lot

299
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:39,156
about it, so let me give you a

300
00:09:39,156 --> 00:09:40,616
little bit of background on

301
00:09:40,616 --> 00:09:40,846
that.

302
00:09:41,246 --> 00:09:42,516
The background session

303
00:09:42,876 --> 00:09:45,716
URLSession API allows your

304
00:09:45,716 --> 00:09:47,086
application to perform

305
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:49,266
networking even if your process,

306
00:09:49,266 --> 00:09:50,796
your application isn't running.

307
00:09:51,926 --> 00:09:53,696
We monitor the system

308
00:09:53,936 --> 00:09:57,286
conditions, CPU, battery, all

309
00:09:57,286 --> 00:09:59,136
sorts of things to really find

310
00:09:59,136 --> 00:10:01,146
of right time to do your

311
00:09:59,136 --> 00:10:01,146
of right time to do your

312
00:10:01,146 --> 00:10:02,496
networking tasks.

313
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:05,866
Now, of course, if you implement

314
00:10:05,866 --> 00:10:07,786
various delegate methods, we're

315
00:10:07,786 --> 00:10:09,456
going to wake up your app and

316
00:10:09,456 --> 00:10:10,946
call those delegate callbacks so

317
00:10:10,946 --> 00:10:11,976
that you can handle that

318
00:10:11,976 --> 00:10:12,816
information.

319
00:10:13,286 --> 00:10:14,326
And, of course, we're going to

320
00:10:14,326 --> 00:10:15,936
make sure your app is running

321
00:10:16,376 --> 00:10:17,706
when your task completes so that

322
00:10:17,706 --> 00:10:19,316
you can then process that data.

323
00:10:19,316 --> 00:10:24,546
Now, one of the great use cases

324
00:10:24,696 --> 00:10:26,556
for background URLSession is

325
00:10:26,556 --> 00:10:28,106
taking advantage of another

326
00:10:28,516 --> 00:10:30,186
feature on the system, which is

327
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:32,376
background app refresh.

328
00:10:33,176 --> 00:10:34,716
Now, what this really does is

329
00:10:34,716 --> 00:10:36,876
allows your application to have

330
00:10:36,876 --> 00:10:38,766
the most current, the freshest

331
00:10:38,766 --> 00:10:39,206
data, right?

332
00:10:39,546 --> 00:10:41,166
There's nothing more frustrating

333
00:10:41,576 --> 00:10:42,936
than pulling your device out,

334
00:10:43,136 --> 00:10:44,456
launching an app, and the first

335
00:10:44,456 --> 00:10:45,426
thing you're greeted with is

336
00:10:45,426 --> 00:10:47,476
some sort of spinner, right?

337
00:10:47,476 --> 00:10:48,326
You're waiting for this

338
00:10:48,326 --> 00:10:50,036
application to start pulling

339
00:10:50,036 --> 00:10:50,586
down data.

340
00:10:50,996 --> 00:10:52,416
You want that data right away.

341
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:53,456
You want to be able to get that

342
00:10:53,456 --> 00:10:55,116
data to your user so your user

343
00:10:55,466 --> 00:10:57,296
is excited and happy to use your

344
00:10:57,296 --> 00:10:57,566
app.

345
00:10:58,106 --> 00:10:59,486
Background app refresh is a way

346
00:10:59,486 --> 00:10:59,806
to do this.

347
00:10:59,806 --> 00:11:01,316
It's a way to tell the system

348
00:10:59,806 --> 00:11:01,316
It's a way to tell the system

349
00:11:01,756 --> 00:11:03,286
that, "Hey, in the future I want

350
00:11:03,286 --> 00:11:04,296
to be able to be launched so

351
00:11:04,296 --> 00:11:05,886
that I can refresh my data so I

352
00:11:05,886 --> 00:11:06,766
have the most important

353
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:08,046
information," maybe stock

354
00:11:08,046 --> 00:11:09,756
information, or weather

355
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:11,396
forecast, other important things

356
00:11:11,396 --> 00:11:12,356
that your app does.

357
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:13,996
Now, this applies to

358
00:11:13,996 --> 00:11:16,566
applications, as well as watchOS

359
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:18,096
complications.

360
00:11:18,426 --> 00:11:19,166
And if you want to learn a

361
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:20,256
little bit more in depth about

362
00:11:20,256 --> 00:11:22,706
background app refresh, you can

363
00:11:22,706 --> 00:11:26,256
go back to 2013 WWDC, as well as

364
00:11:26,256 --> 00:11:28,996
last year's 2016 WWDC and look

365
00:11:28,996 --> 00:11:30,136
at these sessions for more

366
00:11:30,136 --> 00:11:30,816
details.

367
00:11:31,296 --> 00:11:35,786
So let's look at background app

368
00:11:35,786 --> 00:11:37,986
refresh in action; what is it

369
00:11:37,986 --> 00:11:38,766
really doing?

370
00:11:39,496 --> 00:11:41,246
And to do that, we kind of need

371
00:11:41,246 --> 00:11:42,896
to look at the state of your

372
00:11:43,176 --> 00:11:44,026
application.

373
00:11:44,366 --> 00:11:45,876
We're interested in three states

374
00:11:45,876 --> 00:11:47,476
here: A running state, suspended

375
00:11:47,476 --> 00:11:49,626
state, or a background state.

376
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:52,786
Now, with your app running,

377
00:11:52,786 --> 00:11:53,616
you're going to opt into

378
00:11:53,616 --> 00:11:54,936
background app refresh.

379
00:11:54,936 --> 00:11:55,756
You're going to say, "In the

380
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:57,816
future, run my app, make sure my

381
00:11:57,816 --> 00:11:58,936
app runs so that I can get the

382
00:11:58,936 --> 00:12:00,056
latest information."

383
00:11:58,936 --> 00:12:00,056
latest information."

384
00:12:00,556 --> 00:12:02,216
And then your process could be

385
00:12:02,216 --> 00:12:02,846
suspended.

386
00:12:02,846 --> 00:12:04,846
And in the future your process

387
00:12:04,846 --> 00:12:07,036
is now running, your app is now

388
00:12:07,606 --> 00:12:09,486
going to be able to ask for new

389
00:12:09,486 --> 00:12:09,796
data.

390
00:12:09,796 --> 00:12:12,396
And like good developers, this

391
00:12:12,396 --> 00:12:14,076
app is using URLSession API.

392
00:12:14,246 --> 00:12:15,866
In fact, it uses a background

393
00:12:15,866 --> 00:12:16,596
URLSession.

394
00:12:16,596 --> 00:12:19,046
It creates a URLSession task and

395
00:12:19,046 --> 00:12:21,446
schedules this task to run and

396
00:12:21,446 --> 00:12:22,456
grab the data that your

397
00:12:22,456 --> 00:12:23,576
application needs.

398
00:12:25,396 --> 00:12:28,626
Now, your process could go away

399
00:12:28,626 --> 00:12:30,226
at this point, but then at some

400
00:12:30,226 --> 00:12:32,126
point URLSession is going to run

401
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:33,216
your task and it's going to run

402
00:12:33,216 --> 00:12:34,636
it to completion hopefully if

403
00:12:34,636 --> 00:12:35,566
everything goes well.

404
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:36,726
And you're going to get the

405
00:12:36,726 --> 00:12:37,136
data.

406
00:12:37,136 --> 00:12:38,556
So we're going to background

407
00:12:38,556 --> 00:12:40,406
launch your application and

408
00:12:40,406 --> 00:12:41,696
allow you to process that

409
00:12:41,696 --> 00:12:43,936
completed task and process that

410
00:12:43,936 --> 00:12:45,456
data that we've fetched for you.

411
00:12:45,826 --> 00:12:48,856
And then at some point the user

412
00:12:48,856 --> 00:12:49,886
is going to launch your app,

413
00:12:49,886 --> 00:12:50,826
it's going to come foreground,

414
00:12:50,826 --> 00:12:51,746
and boom, they've got the

415
00:12:51,746 --> 00:12:53,016
freshest data there.

416
00:12:53,436 --> 00:12:54,226
So this is great.

417
00:12:54,606 --> 00:12:56,756
But we looked at this flow and

418
00:12:56,756 --> 00:12:57,936
said, "Hmm, maybe there's

419
00:12:57,936 --> 00:13:00,236
something we can do to help our

420
00:12:57,936 --> 00:13:00,236
something we can do to help our

421
00:13:00,236 --> 00:13:02,116
developers improve their

422
00:13:02,116 --> 00:13:04,386
applications on our platforms."

423
00:13:05,026 --> 00:13:06,756
And we think we can do something

424
00:13:06,756 --> 00:13:07,236
for you.

425
00:13:08,596 --> 00:13:10,746
The first problem that we want

426
00:13:10,746 --> 00:13:13,006
to solve is we noticed there's

427
00:13:13,006 --> 00:13:14,836
an extra background launch that

428
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:16,186
had to happen just for you to

429
00:13:16,186 --> 00:13:18,166
create the URLSession task.

430
00:13:19,026 --> 00:13:20,466
And as we all know, anytime your

431
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:21,666
process is launched, what does

432
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:21,976
that do?

433
00:13:21,976 --> 00:13:23,696
It impacts battery life,

434
00:13:24,116 --> 00:13:25,456
requires CPU burden.

435
00:13:25,456 --> 00:13:27,306
So that's not necessarily great

436
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:28,316
for the device if we're doing

437
00:13:28,366 --> 00:13:30,226
extraneous work, and we really

438
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:31,846
don't need to be doing that.

439
00:13:32,936 --> 00:13:34,366
The other problem we'd like to

440
00:13:34,366 --> 00:13:36,146
solve are stale network

441
00:13:36,146 --> 00:13:37,066
requests, right?

442
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:38,996
You're asking URLSession to do

443
00:13:38,996 --> 00:13:39,446
work.

444
00:13:39,446 --> 00:13:40,906
And at some point in the future,

445
00:13:41,396 --> 00:13:42,686
that work is going to complete.

446
00:13:43,126 --> 00:13:44,766
Well, what happens between when

447
00:13:44,766 --> 00:13:46,036
you ask for the work to be done

448
00:13:46,036 --> 00:13:47,356
and when it actually got done?

449
00:13:47,356 --> 00:13:48,796
Maybe there was some change in

450
00:13:48,796 --> 00:13:50,796
context and that original

451
00:13:50,796 --> 00:13:52,046
request doesn't make sense

452
00:13:52,046 --> 00:13:52,576
anymore.

453
00:13:53,216 --> 00:13:53,956
So we need to give you an

454
00:13:53,956 --> 00:13:55,976
opportunity to really, if

455
00:13:56,026 --> 00:13:57,436
there's a context change, let us

456
00:13:57,436 --> 00:13:59,426
know about that and get rid of

457
00:13:59,426 --> 00:14:01,226
these stale network requests.

458
00:13:59,426 --> 00:14:01,226
these stale network requests.

459
00:14:01,226 --> 00:14:02,146
Because there's nothing worse

460
00:14:02,146 --> 00:14:03,406
than getting data and going, "I

461
00:14:03,406 --> 00:14:04,376
can't do anything with it," and

462
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:04,936
throw it away.

463
00:14:05,626 --> 00:14:08,356
And the last problem we think we

464
00:14:08,356 --> 00:14:10,886
could help you with is helping

465
00:14:10,886 --> 00:14:13,556
us know how to best schedule

466
00:14:13,836 --> 00:14:15,596
your URLSession tasks.

467
00:14:16,126 --> 00:14:17,906
When is the most optimal, best

468
00:14:17,906 --> 00:14:19,236
time in the system to be able to

469
00:14:19,236 --> 00:14:20,606
run your task so that we can get

470
00:14:20,606 --> 00:14:21,686
your data in the most efficient

471
00:14:21,686 --> 00:14:23,986
way for you to display that so

472
00:14:23,986 --> 00:14:25,376
that your users are excited and

473
00:14:25,376 --> 00:14:26,346
delighted by that data?

474
00:14:26,346 --> 00:14:29,036
Let's look at what we did.

475
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,206
We're introducing the

476
00:14:32,206 --> 00:14:34,336
URLSessionTask scheduling API.

477
00:14:35,406 --> 00:14:37,216
Now, this is available across

478
00:14:37,216 --> 00:14:38,156
all of our platforms.

479
00:14:38,156 --> 00:14:39,956
It's available in the beta

480
00:14:39,956 --> 00:14:41,296
builds that you have received

481
00:14:41,296 --> 00:14:41,916
here at WWDC.

482
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:44,566
And we encourage you to take a

483
00:14:44,566 --> 00:14:45,656
deep look at this.

484
00:14:46,516 --> 00:14:49,716
Now, what we've done first is we

485
00:14:49,716 --> 00:14:51,346
provided a new property.

486
00:14:51,556 --> 00:14:52,876
This is a property on

487
00:14:52,876 --> 00:14:54,506
URLSessionTask object.

488
00:14:55,066 --> 00:14:57,456
It is called earliestBeginDate.

489
00:14:58,366 --> 00:14:59,406
And what you're going to do here

490
00:14:59,406 --> 00:15:01,116
is provide a date to us in the

491
00:14:59,406 --> 00:15:01,116
is provide a date to us in the

492
00:15:01,116 --> 00:15:03,336
future when you want your task

493
00:15:03,406 --> 00:15:05,586
to be eligible for running.

494
00:15:05,896 --> 00:15:08,266
I use that word eligible because

495
00:15:08,266 --> 00:15:09,016
it's important.

496
00:15:09,016 --> 00:15:10,176
It doesn't mean that this is the

497
00:15:10,176 --> 00:15:11,576
point in time when your task

498
00:15:11,686 --> 00:15:13,486
will run, it will do networking;

499
00:15:13,856 --> 00:15:15,586
it's just telling the system, "I

500
00:15:15,586 --> 00:15:16,706
would like my task to be

501
00:15:16,766 --> 00:15:18,486
eligible so that it can run."

502
00:15:18,796 --> 00:15:20,646
And we're still bound by system

503
00:15:20,646 --> 00:15:23,046
policies as to when we can make

504
00:15:23,046 --> 00:15:25,256
the networking happen for this

505
00:15:25,256 --> 00:15:25,816
task.

506
00:15:26,896 --> 00:15:28,546
It's only applicable to

507
00:15:28,686 --> 00:15:31,326
background URLSessions and tasks

508
00:15:31,326 --> 00:15:33,166
built off of background

509
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:33,876
URLSession.

510
00:15:34,406 --> 00:15:37,896
Let's take a look at how this

511
00:15:37,946 --> 00:15:39,626
property in conjunction with

512
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:41,586
other existing properties really

513
00:15:41,586 --> 00:15:43,446
allows you to do some fine-grain

514
00:15:43,446 --> 00:15:44,046
scheduling.

515
00:15:44,606 --> 00:15:46,356
So you'll create a

516
00:15:46,356 --> 00:15:47,776
URLSessionTask and, of course,

517
00:15:47,776 --> 00:15:49,336
you'll call resume on it so that

518
00:15:49,336 --> 00:15:50,796
we know that this task can now

519
00:15:50,796 --> 00:15:53,456
be put into the queue so that

520
00:15:53,456 --> 00:15:54,566
work can happen.

521
00:15:55,206 --> 00:15:57,396
You'll -- and at this point the

522
00:15:57,806 --> 00:16:00,756
task will be in a waiting state.

523
00:15:57,806 --> 00:16:00,756
task will be in a waiting state.

524
00:16:00,756 --> 00:16:01,486
We're waiting for the

525
00:16:01,566 --> 00:16:03,526
earliestBeginDate to happen.

526
00:16:04,136 --> 00:16:06,506
And as soon as that is hit, that

527
00:16:06,506 --> 00:16:07,836
task becomes eligible for

528
00:16:07,836 --> 00:16:08,116
running.

529
00:16:09,156 --> 00:16:10,516
Now, you can use the existing

530
00:16:10,706 --> 00:16:13,386
timeoutIntervalForResource to

531
00:16:13,386 --> 00:16:15,546
really control how long your app

532
00:16:15,546 --> 00:16:17,326
is willing to wait for at that

533
00:16:17,326 --> 00:16:19,506
resource to get loaded, right?

534
00:16:19,506 --> 00:16:21,596
You might set some amount of

535
00:16:21,596 --> 00:16:23,366
time to say, "After this point

536
00:16:23,526 --> 00:16:25,466
in time, this resource isn't

537
00:16:25,466 --> 00:16:26,706
interesting to me anymore."

538
00:16:27,136 --> 00:16:28,926
And that interval of time covers

539
00:16:29,156 --> 00:16:32,426
from resume to when that timeout

540
00:16:32,426 --> 00:16:34,246
happens based on the value you

541
00:16:34,246 --> 00:16:34,856
place in

542
00:16:34,856 --> 00:16:36,396
timeoutIntervalForResource.

543
00:16:36,716 --> 00:16:41,526
Now, I want to go back to the

544
00:16:41,526 --> 00:16:43,736
original background app refresh

545
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:45,276
workflow that we looked at

546
00:16:45,276 --> 00:16:45,746
earlier.

547
00:16:46,546 --> 00:16:47,316
Right? We noticed there was a

548
00:16:47,316 --> 00:16:49,676
couple of background launches

549
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:50,366
that occurred.

550
00:16:50,736 --> 00:16:54,066
But with this new API we're able

551
00:16:54,066 --> 00:16:55,426
to get rid of one of those.

552
00:16:55,426 --> 00:16:56,336
So the way that your app will

553
00:16:56,336 --> 00:16:58,396
work is while your running,

554
00:16:58,466 --> 00:16:59,146
you're going to create a

555
00:16:59,146 --> 00:17:01,616
URLSessionTask; you'll opt into

556
00:16:59,146 --> 00:17:01,616
URLSessionTask; you'll opt into

557
00:17:01,906 --> 00:17:03,606
our new scheduling API by

558
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:05,376
setting an earliestBeginDate;

559
00:17:05,935 --> 00:17:07,016
then your process can go to

560
00:17:07,016 --> 00:17:07,415
sleep.

561
00:17:07,715 --> 00:17:08,776
We're going to complete the work

562
00:17:08,776 --> 00:17:09,366
for you.

563
00:17:09,955 --> 00:17:11,406
And when that work is available,

564
00:17:11,406 --> 00:17:12,726
we're going to background launch

565
00:17:12,726 --> 00:17:14,195
you that one time and allow you

566
00:17:14,195 --> 00:17:16,136
to process the resulting data.

567
00:17:16,136 --> 00:17:18,486
And then when the user brings

568
00:17:18,486 --> 00:17:19,556
your app to the foreground,

569
00:17:19,556 --> 00:17:21,215
boom, it's got the freshest,

570
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:22,415
most current data.

571
00:17:23,096 --> 00:17:24,626
And we've been able to solve

572
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:26,106
that one problem of that

573
00:17:26,106 --> 00:17:27,796
additional background app

574
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:28,256
launch.

575
00:17:28,256 --> 00:17:29,716
And so it's better performing on

576
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:30,916
the system, and we think that's

577
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:31,346
great.

578
00:17:31,846 --> 00:17:35,016
So that's problem number one

579
00:17:35,306 --> 00:17:35,766
solved.

580
00:17:35,766 --> 00:17:36,736
Let's look at problem number

581
00:17:36,736 --> 00:17:40,660
two, the stale network fetches.

582
00:17:42,296 --> 00:17:43,296
We want to give you an

583
00:17:43,296 --> 00:17:45,316
opportunity to alter future

584
00:17:45,316 --> 00:17:45,936
requests.

585
00:17:45,936 --> 00:17:47,046
So you might have given us a

586
00:17:47,046 --> 00:17:49,316
request, but the context might

587
00:17:49,316 --> 00:17:49,916
change.

588
00:17:50,956 --> 00:17:53,856
We've introduced a new delegate

589
00:17:53,856 --> 00:17:55,326
callback on a

590
00:17:55,326 --> 00:17:57,356
URLSessionTaskDelegate titled

591
00:17:57,796 --> 00:18:00,136
willBeginDelayedRequest.

592
00:17:57,796 --> 00:18:00,136
willBeginDelayedRequest.

593
00:18:01,406 --> 00:18:03,596
With this delegate, you'll be

594
00:18:03,596 --> 00:18:05,506
able to be called at the moment

595
00:18:05,506 --> 00:18:07,136
when your task is about to start

596
00:18:07,136 --> 00:18:07,736
networking.

597
00:18:08,226 --> 00:18:10,416
So it is you've told this that

598
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:12,346
the task is eligible and the

599
00:18:12,346 --> 00:18:14,066
system now has decided yes, this

600
00:18:14,066 --> 00:18:15,026
is the right time to do the

601
00:18:15,026 --> 00:18:15,686
networking.

602
00:18:16,116 --> 00:18:17,096
We're going to call this

603
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,216
delegate method, if you

604
00:18:18,216 --> 00:18:20,076
implement it, and allow you to

605
00:18:20,076 --> 00:18:22,436
make some decisions about this

606
00:18:22,436 --> 00:18:23,036
task.

607
00:18:24,986 --> 00:18:26,256
Now, this will only be called

608
00:18:26,256 --> 00:18:27,966
one, if you implement it; also,

609
00:18:27,966 --> 00:18:29,546
if you opt into the scheduling

610
00:18:29,546 --> 00:18:30,736
API by setting an

611
00:18:30,736 --> 00:18:32,046
earliestBeginDate.

612
00:18:32,366 --> 00:18:33,706
And, again, this is only

613
00:18:33,706 --> 00:18:35,116
available on background

614
00:18:35,116 --> 00:18:36,026
URLSessions.

615
00:18:36,566 --> 00:18:39,526
And as I mentioned, this is an

616
00:18:39,526 --> 00:18:40,556
optional delegate.

617
00:18:40,996 --> 00:18:42,806
And I want to take a second here

618
00:18:42,806 --> 00:18:44,016
to have you really think about

619
00:18:44,046 --> 00:18:45,336
this because it's important,

620
00:18:46,036 --> 00:18:47,136
this delegate method.

621
00:18:47,136 --> 00:18:48,656
As with all delegate methods,

622
00:18:48,656 --> 00:18:49,786
they're all opt into.

623
00:18:50,246 --> 00:18:52,776
But this one will cause some

624
00:18:52,846 --> 00:18:53,926
interesting side effect that

625
00:18:53,926 --> 00:18:54,986
I'll show you in a minute.

626
00:18:55,606 --> 00:18:56,586
You really need to think about,

627
00:18:56,676 --> 00:18:58,356
"Can my application determine

628
00:18:58,356 --> 00:19:00,456
context, the viability of a

629
00:18:58,356 --> 00:19:00,456
context, the viability of a

630
00:19:00,456 --> 00:19:02,396
request in the future?"

631
00:19:02,906 --> 00:19:06,986
Now, there's a completion

632
00:19:06,986 --> 00:19:08,726
handler that's passed to this

633
00:19:08,726 --> 00:19:09,546
delegate method.

634
00:19:10,256 --> 00:19:10,986
And you need to give a

635
00:19:10,986 --> 00:19:12,516
disposition to URLSession.

636
00:19:12,516 --> 00:19:14,456
You need to tell us does the

637
00:19:14,456 --> 00:19:16,276
original request, does it still

638
00:19:16,276 --> 00:19:17,566
make sense?

639
00:19:17,826 --> 00:19:18,756
Go ahead and proceed.

640
00:19:19,226 --> 00:19:21,336
Or maybe the context has changed

641
00:19:21,336 --> 00:19:22,826
enough and you need to make some

642
00:19:22,826 --> 00:19:24,396
modifications, maybe a different

643
00:19:24,396 --> 00:19:26,596
URL or maybe a header value's

644
00:19:26,596 --> 00:19:27,906
different and you want to go

645
00:19:27,906 --> 00:19:29,326
ahead and modify that request at

646
00:19:29,326 --> 00:19:30,736
this point in time right before

647
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:31,796
the networking happens.

648
00:19:32,226 --> 00:19:33,566
Or you might make the decision

649
00:19:34,086 --> 00:19:35,756
this request is just useless at

650
00:19:35,786 --> 00:19:37,076
this point, cancel.

651
00:19:37,396 --> 00:19:42,596
We don't want to do stale

652
00:19:42,596 --> 00:19:42,836
requests.

653
00:19:42,956 --> 00:19:44,736
So now if we go back to this

654
00:19:44,736 --> 00:19:46,926
workflow and we go back to my

655
00:19:46,926 --> 00:19:48,266
comment about really thinking

656
00:19:48,266 --> 00:19:50,026
about this delegate method, you

657
00:19:50,026 --> 00:19:51,926
will see that we're kind of back

658
00:19:51,926 --> 00:19:53,596
to that original workflow where

659
00:19:54,046 --> 00:19:55,776
there's two background launches

660
00:19:55,776 --> 00:19:59,396
in order to satisfy this URL

661
00:19:59,396 --> 00:19:59,976
task.

662
00:20:00,856 --> 00:20:02,356
Right? But we have to stop and

663
00:20:02,356 --> 00:20:03,196
think about that.

664
00:20:03,476 --> 00:20:04,696
What is more expensive,

665
00:20:05,056 --> 00:20:07,046
performing a stale network load

666
00:20:07,046 --> 00:20:09,756
or a mere application background

667
00:20:09,756 --> 00:20:10,186
launch?

668
00:20:10,606 --> 00:20:12,896
It is way more expensive to the

669
00:20:12,896 --> 00:20:14,516
system to do stale loads, get

670
00:20:14,516 --> 00:20:16,016
all this data, and then decide I

671
00:20:16,016 --> 00:20:17,526
don't need it and pitch it.

672
00:20:18,286 --> 00:20:19,966
Okay? So we want you to really

673
00:20:20,016 --> 00:20:21,536
think about this new delegate

674
00:20:21,536 --> 00:20:22,626
method and whether your

675
00:20:22,626 --> 00:20:24,996
application has the ability to

676
00:20:24,996 --> 00:20:27,066
really understand the viability

677
00:20:27,066 --> 00:20:28,836
of your requests in the future.

678
00:20:29,316 --> 00:20:30,436
Hopefully that make sense to

679
00:20:30,436 --> 00:20:30,586
you.

680
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:35,986
Now, the third problem we want

681
00:20:35,986 --> 00:20:38,696
to solve is how do we schedule

682
00:20:39,146 --> 00:20:41,806
your request in a most optimal,

683
00:20:41,806 --> 00:20:43,116
most intelligent way in our

684
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:43,616
system?

685
00:20:43,956 --> 00:20:45,226
There's some information that in

686
00:20:45,226 --> 00:20:46,426
URLSession we just don't know

687
00:20:46,426 --> 00:20:46,776
about.

688
00:20:47,256 --> 00:20:48,496
So we're providing a little bit

689
00:20:48,496 --> 00:20:50,266
of change to our API to allow

690
00:20:50,266 --> 00:20:51,666
you to explain to us some

691
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:53,676
information about your requests

692
00:20:54,056 --> 00:20:56,076
and also about your responses.

693
00:20:56,596 --> 00:20:58,016
We're giving you two properties,

694
00:20:58,116 --> 00:20:59,946
the first one is countOfBytes

695
00:21:00,016 --> 00:21:02,606
ClientExpectsToSend, and the

696
00:21:02,606 --> 00:21:03,846
second one is countOfBytes

697
00:21:03,846 --> 00:21:05,496
ClientExpectsToReceive.

698
00:21:06,176 --> 00:21:07,686
We think you know more about

699
00:21:07,686 --> 00:21:08,556
your requests.

700
00:21:08,556 --> 00:21:10,696
Maybe you have a stream body

701
00:21:10,696 --> 00:21:11,696
that you want to attach to a

702
00:21:11,696 --> 00:21:12,946
request, we don't know about

703
00:21:12,946 --> 00:21:13,206
that.

704
00:21:13,206 --> 00:21:14,456
You probably know the size of

705
00:21:14,456 --> 00:21:14,746
that.

706
00:21:15,386 --> 00:21:16,926
We don't know about your servers

707
00:21:17,176 --> 00:21:18,456
and the size of data your

708
00:21:18,456 --> 00:21:19,546
servers' shipping back.

709
00:21:19,926 --> 00:21:21,486
We believe you have some insight

710
00:21:21,486 --> 00:21:21,876
to that.

711
00:21:21,876 --> 00:21:23,756
And that will give us hints as

712
00:21:23,756 --> 00:21:25,876
how we can in a most optimal,

713
00:21:25,876 --> 00:21:27,626
intelligent way schedule your

714
00:21:27,656 --> 00:21:28,346
tasks.

715
00:21:28,826 --> 00:21:30,626
If you don't know, well, then

716
00:21:30,626 --> 00:21:31,746
you can always specify

717
00:21:31,746 --> 00:21:34,066
NSURLSessionTransferSizeUnknown.

718
00:21:36,286 --> 00:21:37,396
So that solves the third

719
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:37,696
problem.

720
00:21:37,696 --> 00:21:38,836
Let's take a look at how this

721
00:21:38,836 --> 00:21:40,006
new API works in code.

722
00:21:40,006 --> 00:21:41,506
It's very easy to use.

723
00:21:42,216 --> 00:21:43,446
First thing we're going to do is

724
00:21:43,446 --> 00:21:46,086
create a URLSession background

725
00:21:46,086 --> 00:21:46,936
configuration.

726
00:21:46,936 --> 00:21:48,626
We're then going to create a

727
00:21:48,626 --> 00:21:50,366
session based on that

728
00:21:50,826 --> 00:21:51,766
configuration.

729
00:21:52,226 --> 00:21:54,926
Once we have that, we're going

730
00:21:54,926 --> 00:21:57,256
to now generate a URLRequest,

731
00:21:57,636 --> 00:21:59,496
specify the URL we want to go

732
00:21:59,496 --> 00:22:02,296
to, maybe set a header value,

733
00:21:59,496 --> 00:22:02,296
to, maybe set a header value,

734
00:22:02,606 --> 00:22:03,746
something that makes sense for

735
00:22:03,746 --> 00:22:04,346
your task.

736
00:22:04,346 --> 00:22:05,996
Again, this is just an example.

737
00:22:07,586 --> 00:22:08,476
And now we're going to create a

738
00:22:08,476 --> 00:22:09,866
task that encapsulates that

739
00:22:09,866 --> 00:22:11,916
request on that session.

740
00:22:12,566 --> 00:22:13,986
And we're going to opt into the

741
00:22:13,986 --> 00:22:16,316
new scheduling API by setting

742
00:22:16,316 --> 00:22:17,986
the earliestBeginDate property

743
00:22:18,266 --> 00:22:19,116
and give us a date.

744
00:22:19,116 --> 00:22:20,976
In this example we say two hours

745
00:22:20,976 --> 00:22:22,886
from now I want this task to be

746
00:22:22,936 --> 00:22:24,336
eligible to be run.

747
00:22:25,936 --> 00:22:26,916
And I'm also going to give some

748
00:22:26,916 --> 00:22:28,286
hints to URLSession and say,

749
00:22:28,586 --> 00:22:30,126
"This is a small request,

750
00:22:30,126 --> 00:22:31,646
there's no body, I've just set

751
00:22:31,646 --> 00:22:33,896
one header, maybe 80 bytes."

752
00:22:34,216 --> 00:22:36,216
And then my server probably is

753
00:22:36,216 --> 00:22:38,016
going to send about a 2K

754
00:22:38,016 --> 00:22:39,206
response to this.

755
00:22:40,406 --> 00:22:42,026
And with all URLSession tasks,

756
00:22:42,216 --> 00:22:43,376
make sure you call resume.

757
00:22:43,996 --> 00:22:46,406
Now, how does the new delegate

758
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:46,836
work?

759
00:22:47,146 --> 00:22:50,096
Well, we decided I know context.

760
00:22:50,186 --> 00:22:51,636
I can make some intelligent

761
00:22:51,636 --> 00:22:53,846
decisions about my networking

762
00:22:53,846 --> 00:22:56,006
tasks in the future.

763
00:22:56,546 --> 00:22:57,456
So I've implemented

764
00:22:57,456 --> 00:22:58,896
willBeginDelayedRequest.

765
00:22:59,046 --> 00:23:01,946
So in our example here what I've

766
00:22:59,046 --> 00:23:01,946
So in our example here what I've

767
00:23:01,946 --> 00:23:03,916
decided to do is to modify the

768
00:23:03,916 --> 00:23:04,506
request.

769
00:23:04,506 --> 00:23:05,676
I'm going to take the original

770
00:23:05,676 --> 00:23:06,926
request, create a new

771
00:23:06,926 --> 00:23:08,026
updatedRequest.

772
00:23:08,026 --> 00:23:09,526
I'm going to maybe change a

773
00:23:09,526 --> 00:23:10,896
value in the header that makes

774
00:23:10,896 --> 00:23:13,436
more sense now that this task is

775
00:23:13,436 --> 00:23:14,566
actually going to do some

776
00:23:14,566 --> 00:23:15,266
networking.

777
00:23:15,556 --> 00:23:17,506
Time has passed, I have new

778
00:23:17,506 --> 00:23:18,206
information.

779
00:23:18,526 --> 00:23:20,036
I put that information on that

780
00:23:20,036 --> 00:23:20,426
task.

781
00:23:20,826 --> 00:23:21,956
And then I'm going to call the

782
00:23:21,956 --> 00:23:24,626
completionHandler and use a

783
00:23:24,626 --> 00:23:26,896
disposition of useNewRequest and

784
00:23:26,896 --> 00:23:28,246
passed it that new request.

785
00:23:28,246 --> 00:23:29,076
If you take a look at our header

786
00:23:29,076 --> 00:23:30,266
file, you can see other

787
00:23:30,266 --> 00:23:33,166
dispositions available to you in

788
00:23:33,166 --> 00:23:36,666
this completionHandler call.

789
00:23:36,816 --> 00:23:39,136
So let me recap the scheduling

790
00:23:39,256 --> 00:23:40,756
API that we're introducing here.

791
00:23:41,206 --> 00:23:42,696
Background URLSession is an

792
00:23:42,816 --> 00:23:45,146
awesome API for doing networking

793
00:23:45,146 --> 00:23:46,276
that allows your application to

794
00:23:46,276 --> 00:23:47,496
not even be running and have

795
00:23:47,496 --> 00:23:49,026
this networking happen for you.

796
00:23:50,086 --> 00:23:51,666
Our new scheduling API will

797
00:23:51,716 --> 00:23:54,156
allow you to delay your requests

798
00:23:54,406 --> 00:23:57,226
so that they can, you know,

799
00:23:57,226 --> 00:23:59,356
obtain and pull down the

800
00:23:59,356 --> 00:24:00,786
freshest information for your

801
00:23:59,356 --> 00:24:00,786
freshest information for your

802
00:24:00,786 --> 00:24:01,566
application.

803
00:24:02,186 --> 00:24:03,426
And it's really we give you an

804
00:24:03,426 --> 00:24:04,766
opportunity to alter those

805
00:24:04,766 --> 00:24:06,456
things based on the context and

806
00:24:06,456 --> 00:24:07,996
the time at when the networking

807
00:24:07,996 --> 00:24:10,376
is actually going to happen.

808
00:24:10,376 --> 00:24:11,856
The other part of this API

809
00:24:12,036 --> 00:24:13,616
change is to allow you to give

810
00:24:13,616 --> 00:24:14,916
hints to us so that we can be

811
00:24:14,916 --> 00:24:16,836
super intelligent and make these

812
00:24:16,836 --> 00:24:18,446
tasks run at the most optimal

813
00:24:18,446 --> 00:24:20,706
time on these devices.

814
00:24:21,286 --> 00:24:24,936
Now, I'd like to turn the time

815
00:24:24,936 --> 00:24:26,556
over to Stuart Cheshire, an

816
00:24:26,556 --> 00:24:28,086
Apple distinguished engineer.

817
00:24:28,086 --> 00:24:29,466
And thank you for your time.

818
00:24:30,516 --> 00:24:33,826
[ Applause ]

819
00:24:34,326 --> 00:24:36,716
&gt;&gt; Stuart Cheshire: Thank you,

820
00:24:38,576 --> 00:24:38,696
Jeff.

821
00:24:38,896 --> 00:24:40,636
Now we're going to talk about

822
00:24:41,066 --> 00:24:43,006
enhancements in URLSession.

823
00:24:43,456 --> 00:24:45,156
We have four things to cover,

824
00:24:45,466 --> 00:24:46,276
let's move through them.

825
00:24:48,866 --> 00:24:49,876
Often you want to show a

826
00:24:49,876 --> 00:24:51,756
progress bar to indicate to the

827
00:24:51,756 --> 00:24:53,766
users how progress is being

828
00:24:53,766 --> 00:24:54,026
made.

829
00:24:54,676 --> 00:24:56,676
And right now this is a little

830
00:24:56,676 --> 00:24:57,456
bit cumbersome.

831
00:24:57,936 --> 00:24:59,746
There are four variables that

832
00:24:59,746 --> 00:25:00,996
you need to monitor with

833
00:24:59,746 --> 00:25:00,996
you need to monitor with

834
00:25:00,996 --> 00:25:02,236
Key-value Observing.

835
00:25:02,776 --> 00:25:04,576
And sometimes the

836
00:25:04,576 --> 00:25:07,426
countOfBytesExpectedToReceive or

837
00:25:07,426 --> 00:25:09,000
Send is not always available.

838
00:25:12,266 --> 00:25:15,936
The good news now in iOS 11 is

839
00:25:16,196 --> 00:25:18,386
URLSessionTask has adopted the

840
00:25:18,456 --> 00:25:20,116
ProgressReporting protocol.

841
00:25:21,226 --> 00:25:23,466
You can get a progress object

842
00:25:23,896 --> 00:25:28,066
from the URLSessionTask, and

843
00:25:28,606 --> 00:25:30,876
that gives you a variable

844
00:25:30,876 --> 00:25:32,966
fractionCompleted, which is a

845
00:25:32,966 --> 00:25:35,206
number in the range zero to one.

846
00:25:35,656 --> 00:25:37,676
You can also provide strings to

847
00:25:37,676 --> 00:25:40,056
give more detail about what the

848
00:25:40,056 --> 00:25:40,776
operation is.

849
00:25:41,396 --> 00:25:42,816
You can attach that progress

850
00:25:42,816 --> 00:25:46,186
object to a UIProgressView or an

851
00:25:46,216 --> 00:25:48,536
NSProgressIndicator to get an

852
00:25:48,536 --> 00:25:49,996
automatic progress bar.

853
00:25:50,416 --> 00:25:52,886
You can also combine multiple

854
00:25:52,886 --> 00:25:55,016
progress objects into a parent

855
00:25:55,016 --> 00:25:56,826
progress object when you're

856
00:25:56,826 --> 00:25:58,726
performing multiple tasks, such

857
00:25:58,726 --> 00:26:00,306
as downloading a file,

858
00:25:58,726 --> 00:26:00,306
as downloading a file,

859
00:26:00,596 --> 00:26:02,536
decompressing a file, and then

860
00:26:02,536 --> 00:26:03,486
handling the data.

861
00:26:04,556 --> 00:26:07,246
So that makes your progress

862
00:26:07,246 --> 00:26:09,126
reporting much simpler.

863
00:26:10,676 --> 00:26:13,166
The binding between a

864
00:26:13,166 --> 00:26:15,616
URLSessionTask and the progress

865
00:26:15,616 --> 00:26:17,036
object is bidirectional.

866
00:26:17,656 --> 00:26:19,866
So if you suspend a

867
00:26:19,866 --> 00:26:21,666
URLSessionTask, that is the same

868
00:26:21,666 --> 00:26:23,936
as pausing the progress object.

869
00:26:23,936 --> 00:26:25,096
If you pause the progress

870
00:26:25,096 --> 00:26:26,616
object, that is the same as

871
00:26:26,616 --> 00:26:28,726
suspending the URLSessionTask.

872
00:26:29,336 --> 00:26:34,656
We now have support for the

873
00:26:34,656 --> 00:26:36,756
Brotli compression algorithm.

874
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:40,576
In tests this compresses about

875
00:26:40,576 --> 00:26:42,996
15% better than gzip, which

876
00:26:42,996 --> 00:26:45,696
results in faster network

877
00:26:45,696 --> 00:26:46,306
access.

878
00:26:48,006 --> 00:26:49,376
Like other new compression

879
00:26:49,376 --> 00:26:51,706
schemes, this is only used over

880
00:26:51,706 --> 00:26:53,616
encrypted connections to avoid

881
00:26:53,616 --> 00:26:55,496
confusing middle boxes that

882
00:26:55,496 --> 00:26:56,616
might not recognize this

883
00:26:56,616 --> 00:26:57,166
compression.

884
00:26:59,896 --> 00:27:03,466
Because Safari uses URLSession,

885
00:26:59,896 --> 00:27:03,466
Because Safari uses URLSession,

886
00:27:03,466 --> 00:27:05,096
that's also means Safari gets

887
00:27:05,096 --> 00:27:07,026
the benefit of this new Brotli

888
00:27:07,026 --> 00:27:08,106
compression algorithm.

889
00:27:08,526 --> 00:27:10,896
And many major websites have

890
00:27:10,896 --> 00:27:12,566
already announced support for

891
00:27:12,566 --> 00:27:14,006
Brotli in their web service.

892
00:27:14,006 --> 00:27:17,776
Our next topic is the Public

893
00:27:17,776 --> 00:27:18,586
Suffix List.

894
00:27:19,216 --> 00:27:20,616
The Public Suffix List is

895
00:27:20,616 --> 00:27:22,846
sometimes called the effective

896
00:27:22,846 --> 00:27:24,076
top-level domain list.

897
00:27:24,836 --> 00:27:27,946
And this is important for

898
00:27:27,946 --> 00:27:29,776
determining where administrative

899
00:27:29,776 --> 00:27:31,566
boundaries occur in the

900
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:32,756
namespace of the Internet.

901
00:27:34,036 --> 00:27:35,566
One thing we don't want to allow

902
00:27:36,026 --> 00:27:40,126
is for a website to set a cookie

903
00:27:40,126 --> 00:27:42,096
on the com domain, which is then

904
00:27:42,096 --> 00:27:44,006
accessible to any other dot com

905
00:27:44,006 --> 00:27:44,486
company.

906
00:27:45,066 --> 00:27:47,916
So you might be tempted to make

907
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:50,486
a rule that you can't set

908
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:52,576
cookies on top level domains,

909
00:27:52,636 --> 00:27:54,546
only on second level and lower.

910
00:27:55,146 --> 00:27:56,926
But domains are named

911
00:27:56,926 --> 00:27:58,416
differently in different parts

912
00:27:58,416 --> 00:27:59,006
of the world.

913
00:28:00,086 --> 00:28:03,276
In America, Apple.com and

914
00:28:03,276 --> 00:28:04,886
FileMaker.com are different

915
00:28:04,886 --> 00:28:05,396
companies.

916
00:28:06,136 --> 00:28:08,236
But in Australia many, many

917
00:28:08,236 --> 00:28:10,526
companies are under com.au, and

918
00:28:10,746 --> 00:28:11,806
that doesn't make them all the

919
00:28:11,806 --> 00:28:12,486
same company.

920
00:28:12,786 --> 00:28:15,196
So the Public Suffix List is a

921
00:28:15,196 --> 00:28:17,706
file of rules and patterns that

922
00:28:17,706 --> 00:28:20,726
tells software how to judge

923
00:28:20,816 --> 00:28:22,396
where administrative boundaries

924
00:28:22,436 --> 00:28:23,226
occur.

925
00:28:24,076 --> 00:28:28,396
This is used for partitioning

926
00:28:28,396 --> 00:28:32,876
cookies, and it's used by the

927
00:28:32,876 --> 00:28:34,296
URLSession APIs.

928
00:28:34,376 --> 00:28:36,046
And if you use the

929
00:28:36,046 --> 00:28:37,876
HTTPCookieStorage APIs directly,

930
00:28:38,036 --> 00:28:39,206
it's supported there, too.

931
00:28:40,346 --> 00:28:41,506
We used to update this in

932
00:28:41,506 --> 00:28:43,576
software updates, but now with

933
00:28:43,616 --> 00:28:46,106
the more rapid progress in

934
00:28:46,106 --> 00:28:47,626
creating top level domains,

935
00:28:48,066 --> 00:28:49,796
we've changed to doing this over

936
00:28:49,796 --> 00:28:50,346
the air.

937
00:28:50,606 --> 00:28:52,046
We could push a new list every

938
00:28:52,046 --> 00:28:56,476
two weeks if we wanted to.

939
00:28:57,416 --> 00:29:01,636
URLSessionStreamTask is the API

940
00:28:57,416 --> 00:29:01,636
URLSessionStreamTask is the API

941
00:29:01,726 --> 00:29:03,506
you would use if you just want a

942
00:29:03,506 --> 00:29:04,146
byte stream.

943
00:29:04,436 --> 00:29:06,896
If you're not doing HTTP Style

944
00:29:06,896 --> 00:29:08,536
Gets but say you want to write a

945
00:29:08,536 --> 00:29:09,196
mail client,

946
00:29:09,596 --> 00:29:12,676
URLSessionStreamTask gives you a

947
00:29:12,676 --> 00:29:13,626
simple byte stream.

948
00:29:14,766 --> 00:29:16,646
It supports upgrading to TLS

949
00:29:16,646 --> 00:29:18,026
with the STARTTLS option.

950
00:29:18,276 --> 00:29:21,286
If you have existing code that

951
00:29:21,416 --> 00:29:22,866
is written using the old

952
00:29:22,866 --> 00:29:25,526
NSInputStream and NSOutputStream

953
00:29:25,526 --> 00:29:27,796
APIs, you can extract those

954
00:29:27,796 --> 00:29:29,156
objects from a

955
00:29:29,236 --> 00:29:32,016
URLSessionStreamTask to use your

956
00:29:32,016 --> 00:29:32,566
old code.

957
00:29:32,886 --> 00:29:34,016
But for any new code you're

958
00:29:34,016 --> 00:29:36,006
writing, we strongly recommend

959
00:29:36,066 --> 00:29:38,246
that you use the new native

960
00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:40,676
URLSessionStreamTask APIs.

961
00:29:41,486 --> 00:29:42,836
We announced this a couple of

962
00:29:42,836 --> 00:29:46,116
years ago at WWDC 2015.

963
00:29:46,596 --> 00:29:49,336
What we have new for you now is

964
00:29:49,396 --> 00:29:50,836
automatic navigation of

965
00:29:50,836 --> 00:29:52,446
authenticating proxies.

966
00:29:52,666 --> 00:29:53,776
If the proxy requires

967
00:29:53,776 --> 00:29:56,336
credentials, then we will

968
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:57,886
automatically extract those from

969
00:29:57,886 --> 00:29:59,106
the key chain or promptly the

970
00:29:59,106 --> 00:30:01,326
user on your behalf.

971
00:29:59,106 --> 00:30:01,326
user on your behalf.

972
00:30:03,136 --> 00:30:05,276
So we've covered the

973
00:30:05,276 --> 00:30:07,346
enhancements for URLSession,

974
00:30:07,816 --> 00:30:08,496
let's move on.

975
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:15,636
[ Applause ]

976
00:30:16,136 --> 00:30:16,476
Thank you.

977
00:30:18,346 --> 00:30:21,076
Tips and hints that we've

978
00:30:21,076 --> 00:30:23,846
learned from our years helping

979
00:30:23,846 --> 00:30:24,476
developers.

980
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:29,116
Number one rule: Don't use BSD

981
00:30:29,116 --> 00:30:29,726
Sockets.

982
00:30:33,246 --> 00:30:34,536
And by the same token, we

983
00:30:34,536 --> 00:30:36,436
encourage you not to embed

984
00:30:36,746 --> 00:30:39,156
libraries that are based on BSD

985
00:30:39,156 --> 00:30:39,796
Sockets.

986
00:30:41,356 --> 00:30:44,386
Because we do lots of work, as

987
00:30:44,386 --> 00:30:46,116
you've been hearing today, to

988
00:30:46,116 --> 00:30:48,286
provide benefits to your

989
00:30:48,286 --> 00:30:49,146
applications.

990
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:51,676
We provide Wi-Fi Assist so that

991
00:30:51,676 --> 00:30:53,246
your application succeeds

992
00:30:53,356 --> 00:30:54,856
instead of failing when Wi-Fi

993
00:30:54,856 --> 00:30:55,596
isn't working.

994
00:30:56,146 --> 00:30:58,386
We provide techniques to

995
00:30:58,796 --> 00:31:01,156
minimize CPU use and minimize

996
00:30:58,796 --> 00:31:01,156
minimize CPU use and minimize

997
00:31:01,196 --> 00:31:02,946
battery use to give users longer

998
00:31:02,946 --> 00:31:03,676
battery life.

999
00:31:04,376 --> 00:31:06,456
We have the ability to do tasks

1000
00:31:06,456 --> 00:31:08,116
in the background when your

1001
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:09,536
application isn't even running.

1002
00:31:09,796 --> 00:31:11,096
And the third-party libraries

1003
00:31:11,096 --> 00:31:12,196
just can't do anything when

1004
00:31:12,196 --> 00:31:13,206
they're not in memory running.

1005
00:31:14,556 --> 00:31:18,116
And final bit of advice: Always

1006
00:31:18,116 --> 00:31:20,396
try to use connect-by-name APIs

1007
00:31:20,736 --> 00:31:22,746
as opposed to APIs where you

1008
00:31:22,746 --> 00:31:24,916
resolve a name to an IP address

1009
00:31:24,976 --> 00:31:26,256
and then connect to the address.

1010
00:31:27,036 --> 00:31:28,546
We talked earlier about the

1011
00:31:28,546 --> 00:31:30,466
requirement for IPv6 support.

1012
00:31:30,996 --> 00:31:33,016
And the reason that almost all

1013
00:31:33,276 --> 00:31:36,366
of your apps worked perfectly is

1014
00:31:36,416 --> 00:31:37,826
because when you use

1015
00:31:37,826 --> 00:31:40,366
connect-by-name APIs, you don't

1016
00:31:40,366 --> 00:31:41,506
get involved with the IP

1017
00:31:41,506 --> 00:31:41,956
addresses.

1018
00:31:42,046 --> 00:31:43,136
And if you're not involved with

1019
00:31:43,136 --> 00:31:45,496
the IP address, you don't need

1020
00:31:45,496 --> 00:31:47,726
to care whether it's v4 or v6,

1021
00:31:48,196 --> 00:31:50,846
it just works.

1022
00:31:50,886 --> 00:31:53,366
Another question we often get is

1023
00:31:53,366 --> 00:31:54,706
about the timeout values.

1024
00:31:55,096 --> 00:31:56,316
So I want to recap that.

1025
00:31:57,466 --> 00:31:59,476
The timeoutIntervalForResource

1026
00:32:00,456 --> 00:32:02,496
is the time limit for fetching

1027
00:32:02,496 --> 00:32:03,566
the entire resource.

1028
00:32:03,646 --> 00:32:06,436
By default, this is seven days.

1029
00:32:07,346 --> 00:32:08,996
If the entire resource has not

1030
00:32:08,996 --> 00:32:10,206
been fetched by that time, it

1031
00:32:10,206 --> 00:32:10,666
will fail.

1032
00:32:11,716 --> 00:32:14,726
timeoutIntervalForRequest is a

1033
00:32:14,726 --> 00:32:17,036
timer that only starts once the

1034
00:32:17,036 --> 00:32:18,166
transfer starts.

1035
00:32:18,646 --> 00:32:21,386
Once it starts, if your transfer

1036
00:32:21,386 --> 00:32:23,796
stalls and ceases making

1037
00:32:23,796 --> 00:32:24,986
progress for that time-out

1038
00:32:24,986 --> 00:32:26,806
value, that when that timer will

1039
00:32:26,806 --> 00:32:27,826
fire.

1040
00:32:29,876 --> 00:32:33,356
We have seen developers that

1041
00:32:33,356 --> 00:32:35,766
take their old NSURLConnection

1042
00:32:35,766 --> 00:32:38,716
code and convert it to the new

1043
00:32:38,716 --> 00:32:41,066
URLSession code by mechanically

1044
00:32:41,256 --> 00:32:43,946
making a URLSession for every

1045
00:32:43,946 --> 00:32:46,186
old NSURLConnection they used to

1046
00:32:46,186 --> 00:32:46,406
have.

1047
00:32:47,076 --> 00:32:48,566
This is very inefficient and

1048
00:32:48,566 --> 00:32:49,006
wasteful.

1049
00:32:49,186 --> 00:32:51,486
For almost all of your apps what

1050
00:32:51,486 --> 00:32:53,436
you want to have is just one

1051
00:32:53,436 --> 00:32:55,446
URLSession, which can then have

1052
00:32:55,446 --> 00:32:56,786
as many tasks as you want.

1053
00:32:57,696 --> 00:32:59,236
The only time you would want

1054
00:32:59,236 --> 00:33:01,446
more than one URLSession is when

1055
00:32:59,236 --> 00:33:01,446
more than one URLSession is when

1056
00:33:01,446 --> 00:33:02,946
you have groups of different

1057
00:33:02,946 --> 00:33:04,936
operations that have radically

1058
00:33:04,936 --> 00:33:05,926
different requirements.

1059
00:33:06,086 --> 00:33:07,786
And in that case you might

1060
00:33:07,816 --> 00:33:08,836
create two different

1061
00:33:08,836 --> 00:33:11,066
configuration objects and create

1062
00:33:11,066 --> 00:33:13,436
two different URLSessions using

1063
00:33:13,436 --> 00:33:15,096
those two configuration objects.

1064
00:33:15,546 --> 00:33:17,666
One example is private browsing

1065
00:33:17,666 --> 00:33:19,686
in Safari where each private

1066
00:33:19,686 --> 00:33:21,116
browsing window is its own

1067
00:33:21,116 --> 00:33:23,316
separate URLSession so that it

1068
00:33:23,316 --> 00:33:24,636
doesn't share cookies and other

1069
00:33:24,636 --> 00:33:25,936
states with the other sessions.

1070
00:33:27,896 --> 00:33:30,496
Most apps can just have one

1071
00:33:30,496 --> 00:33:32,326
statically-allocated URLSession,

1072
00:33:32,326 --> 00:33:33,016
and that's fine.

1073
00:33:33,376 --> 00:33:34,776
But if you do allocate

1074
00:33:34,776 --> 00:33:36,266
URLSessions dynamically,

1075
00:33:36,606 --> 00:33:38,266
remember to clean up afterwards.

1076
00:33:38,696 --> 00:33:40,096
Either finish tasks and

1077
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:42,526
invalidate or invalidate and

1078
00:33:42,526 --> 00:33:42,936
cancel.

1079
00:33:43,346 --> 00:33:44,286
But if you don't clean up,

1080
00:33:44,496 --> 00:33:45,296
you'll leak memory.

1081
00:33:45,856 --> 00:33:50,956
We get developers asking us

1082
00:33:51,016 --> 00:33:52,776
about convenience methods and

1083
00:33:52,776 --> 00:33:53,836
delegate callbacks.

1084
00:33:55,336 --> 00:33:57,426
Delegate callbacks give you

1085
00:33:57,426 --> 00:33:59,376
detailed step-by-step progress

1086
00:33:59,376 --> 00:34:01,546
information on the state of your

1087
00:33:59,376 --> 00:34:01,546
information on the state of your

1088
00:34:01,546 --> 00:34:01,926
task.

1089
00:34:02,506 --> 00:34:04,236
The convenience methods, like

1090
00:34:04,236 --> 00:34:06,516
the name suggests, are a quick

1091
00:34:06,516 --> 00:34:09,246
and easy way of using the API.

1092
00:34:10,795 --> 00:34:13,106
With convenience methods you

1093
00:34:13,106 --> 00:34:14,565
don't get all the intermediate

1094
00:34:14,565 --> 00:34:16,466
delegate callbacks, you just get

1095
00:34:16,466 --> 00:34:18,346
the final result reported to the

1096
00:34:18,346 --> 00:34:19,246
completionHandler.

1097
00:34:21,005 --> 00:34:22,626
Don't mix and match both on the

1098
00:34:22,626 --> 00:34:24,636
same URLSession, pick one style

1099
00:34:24,636 --> 00:34:25,456
and be consistent.

1100
00:34:26,536 --> 00:34:27,356
If you're using the

1101
00:34:27,396 --> 00:34:28,985
completionHandler, you will not

1102
00:34:28,985 --> 00:34:30,876
get the delegate callbacks with

1103
00:34:30,916 --> 00:34:31,846
two exceptions.

1104
00:34:33,295 --> 00:34:35,706
If networking is not currently

1105
00:34:35,706 --> 00:34:37,795
available and the task is

1106
00:34:37,795 --> 00:34:39,815
waiting for connectivity, you'll

1107
00:34:39,815 --> 00:34:41,565
be notified of that in case you

1108
00:34:41,565 --> 00:34:42,936
want to show some indication in

1109
00:34:42,976 --> 00:34:44,396
your UI.

1110
00:34:44,396 --> 00:34:45,786
The other delegate method you

1111
00:34:45,786 --> 00:34:47,636
may get notified is the

1112
00:34:47,636 --> 00:34:48,376
didReceive

1113
00:34:48,376 --> 00:34:49,565
AuthenticationChallenge.

1114
00:34:50,266 --> 00:34:54,656
So here's a summary of the

1115
00:34:54,706 --> 00:34:58,636
options available to you.

1116
00:34:58,636 --> 00:35:00,416
Doing URLSessionTasks in your

1117
00:34:58,636 --> 00:35:00,416
Doing URLSessionTasks in your

1118
00:35:00,416 --> 00:35:03,516
process with waits for

1119
00:35:03,516 --> 00:35:05,206
connectivity as we recommend,

1120
00:35:06,206 --> 00:35:07,486
the task will start immediately

1121
00:35:07,486 --> 00:35:10,266
if it can; or if it can't, it

1122
00:35:10,266 --> 00:35:11,776
will start at the first possible

1123
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:12,346
opportunity.

1124
00:35:13,226 --> 00:35:14,666
You also have the option of

1125
00:35:14,666 --> 00:35:16,176
doing tasks in the background.

1126
00:35:17,346 --> 00:35:18,516
And you can do background

1127
00:35:18,516 --> 00:35:20,346
discretionary tasks, which will

1128
00:35:20,346 --> 00:35:22,406
wait until the best time in

1129
00:35:22,406 --> 00:35:25,776
terms of battery power and Wi-Fi

1130
00:35:25,776 --> 00:35:26,330
networking.

1131
00:35:30,356 --> 00:35:31,816
Now I have a couple of ongoing

1132
00:35:31,816 --> 00:35:33,606
developments to talk about.

1133
00:35:35,386 --> 00:35:36,616
I'm sure many people in this

1134
00:35:36,616 --> 00:35:38,686
room have heard about TLS 1.3.

1135
00:35:39,596 --> 00:35:41,716
TLS, Transport Layer Security is

1136
00:35:41,716 --> 00:35:43,566
the protocol that encrypts your

1137
00:35:43,566 --> 00:35:45,516
data on the network to prevent

1138
00:35:45,516 --> 00:35:47,966
eavesdroppers from seeing it and

1139
00:35:48,276 --> 00:35:50,636
perhaps as importantly to make

1140
00:35:50,636 --> 00:35:51,816
sure that you have connected to

1141
00:35:51,886 --> 00:35:53,066
the server you intended to

1142
00:35:53,066 --> 00:35:53,596
connect to.

1143
00:35:54,506 --> 00:35:57,646
TLS 1.2 is very old at this

1144
00:35:57,646 --> 00:35:58,116
stage.

1145
00:35:58,116 --> 00:35:59,516
It has a number of problems that

1146
00:35:59,516 --> 00:36:00,426
have been discovered.

1147
00:35:59,516 --> 00:36:00,426
have been discovered.

1148
00:36:00,996 --> 00:36:04,696
And TLS 1.3 is almost finished.

1149
00:36:05,426 --> 00:36:06,706
That standard is not quite

1150
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:07,406
finalized.

1151
00:36:07,966 --> 00:36:09,996
Apple is participating in that

1152
00:36:09,996 --> 00:36:13,686
IETF working group, and we

1153
00:36:13,686 --> 00:36:14,756
expect that to be finished by

1154
00:36:14,756 --> 00:36:15,526
the end of this year.

1155
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:17,456
In the meantime, we do have a

1156
00:36:17,456 --> 00:36:19,666
draft implementation if you want

1157
00:36:19,666 --> 00:36:21,136
to experiment with it right now.

1158
00:36:21,816 --> 00:36:23,726
And if you check out the

1159
00:36:23,726 --> 00:36:26,146
security session from this Apple

1160
00:36:26,146 --> 00:36:27,326
Developer Conference, you can

1161
00:36:27,326 --> 00:36:29,566
learn how to experiment with

1162
00:36:30,116 --> 00:36:30,226
that.

1163
00:36:30,446 --> 00:36:32,036
Another thing you may have heard

1164
00:36:32,036 --> 00:36:32,736
of is QUIC.

1165
00:36:33,706 --> 00:36:35,786
QUIC is a new transport protocol

1166
00:36:36,236 --> 00:36:39,236
designed to experiment with new

1167
00:36:39,236 --> 00:36:41,666
ideas that are hard to do with

1168
00:36:42,216 --> 00:36:42,500
TCP.

1169
00:36:42,716 --> 00:36:43,886
QUIC started out as an

1170
00:36:43,886 --> 00:36:45,156
experiment by some Google

1171
00:36:45,156 --> 00:36:47,546
engineers, and it was a very

1172
00:36:47,896 --> 00:36:49,186
successful experiment.

1173
00:36:49,236 --> 00:36:50,096
They learned a lot.

1174
00:36:50,256 --> 00:36:52,056
Some ideas were good, some

1175
00:36:52,056 --> 00:36:53,446
turned out not to work as well

1176
00:36:53,446 --> 00:36:55,116
as they hoped.

1177
00:36:55,766 --> 00:36:58,346
Those engineers have taken those

1178
00:36:58,346 --> 00:36:59,916
lessons they learned to the

1179
00:36:59,916 --> 00:37:00,646
IETF.

1180
00:36:59,916 --> 00:37:00,646
IETF.

1181
00:37:00,646 --> 00:37:02,306
We have formed a new working

1182
00:37:02,306 --> 00:37:03,916
group to develop the IETF

1183
00:37:03,916 --> 00:37:05,346
standard QUIC protocol.

1184
00:37:06,316 --> 00:37:07,856
Apple is also participating in

1185
00:37:07,856 --> 00:37:08,796
that working group.

1186
00:37:08,946 --> 00:37:10,626
That is not nearly as far long

1187
00:37:10,796 --> 00:37:12,666
as TLS is, but that is also

1188
00:37:12,666 --> 00:37:13,746
making good progress.

1189
00:37:17,416 --> 00:37:19,516
Before we finish, one other

1190
00:37:19,516 --> 00:37:20,676
thing we should talk about,

1191
00:37:21,496 --> 00:37:22,206
Bonjour.

1192
00:37:25,036 --> 00:37:27,866
Fifteen year ago at this very

1193
00:37:27,866 --> 00:37:29,946
convention center in San Jose,

1194
00:37:30,616 --> 00:37:32,506
Steve Jobs announced Bonjour to

1195
00:37:32,506 --> 00:37:32,906
the world.

1196
00:37:33,246 --> 00:37:35,326
And I got the opportunity to

1197
00:37:35,326 --> 00:37:37,056
tell you all how it worked.

1198
00:37:37,456 --> 00:37:39,196
A lot has happened since then.

1199
00:37:40,356 --> 00:37:44,686
Since we launched it in 2004, we

1200
00:37:44,686 --> 00:37:46,786
brought out Bonjour for Windows,

1201
00:37:46,786 --> 00:37:47,526
for Linux.

1202
00:37:47,606 --> 00:37:49,046
We had Java APIs.

1203
00:37:50,356 --> 00:37:52,476
The next year Mac OS X 10.4

1204
00:37:52,476 --> 00:37:54,306
introduced wide-area Bonjour to

1205
00:37:54,456 --> 00:37:55,596
complement the local

1206
00:37:55,596 --> 00:37:57,396
multicast-based Bonjour that was

1207
00:37:57,396 --> 00:37:59,886
in the original Mac OS 10.2

1208
00:38:00,396 --> 00:38:00,716
launch.

1209
00:38:01,726 --> 00:38:03,526
The same year the Linux

1210
00:38:03,526 --> 00:38:04,986
community came out with a

1211
00:38:04,986 --> 00:38:06,556
completely independent

1212
00:38:06,556 --> 00:38:08,456
GPL-licensed implementation of

1213
00:38:08,456 --> 00:38:09,776
Bonjour called Avahi.

1214
00:38:11,126 --> 00:38:12,566
A couple of years after that,

1215
00:38:13,256 --> 00:38:15,226
Apple shipped Back to My Mac,

1216
00:38:15,736 --> 00:38:17,956
which is built on the wide-area

1217
00:38:17,956 --> 00:38:19,666
Bonjour capabilities introduced

1218
00:38:19,666 --> 00:38:20,656
in 10.4.

1219
00:38:21,476 --> 00:38:23,796
And in 2009 we brought out the

1220
00:38:23,796 --> 00:38:26,026
Bonjour Sleep Proxy, which let

1221
00:38:26,026 --> 00:38:27,196
you get Back to Your Mac at

1222
00:38:27,196 --> 00:38:28,686
Home, even when it was asleep to

1223
00:38:28,686 --> 00:38:29,666
save power.

1224
00:38:30,306 --> 00:38:33,216
In the years since then, Android

1225
00:38:33,266 --> 00:38:35,566
adopted with Bonjour with their

1226
00:38:35,566 --> 00:38:38,386
own native APIs in 2012.

1227
00:38:38,386 --> 00:38:40,556
That was in API Level 16 for

1228
00:38:40,556 --> 00:38:41,606
those of you paying attention.

1229
00:38:42,406 --> 00:38:43,936
And a couple of years ago,

1230
00:38:44,076 --> 00:38:45,626
Windows 10 added their own

1231
00:38:45,706 --> 00:38:47,206
native Bonjour support.

1232
00:38:47,756 --> 00:38:48,936
Now, I know a lot of people in

1233
00:38:48,936 --> 00:38:50,376
this room are well aware of the

1234
00:38:50,476 --> 00:38:50,926
history.

1235
00:38:51,236 --> 00:38:52,846
We know about the major OS

1236
00:38:52,846 --> 00:38:54,596
vendors adopting Bonjour.

1237
00:38:55,726 --> 00:38:57,116
But something else happened that

1238
00:38:57,116 --> 00:38:59,366
surprised even me: Bonjour

1239
00:38:59,366 --> 00:39:01,616
started showing up in a lot of

1240
00:38:59,366 --> 00:39:01,616
started showing up in a lot of

1241
00:39:01,616 --> 00:39:02,416
other places.

1242
00:39:02,666 --> 00:39:04,066
And I want to illustrate this

1243
00:39:04,326 --> 00:39:05,456
with just a little personal

1244
00:39:05,456 --> 00:39:06,016
anecdote.

1245
00:39:06,066 --> 00:39:07,586
I recently bought a new house.

1246
00:39:08,316 --> 00:39:09,716
And as part of the process of

1247
00:39:09,716 --> 00:39:11,126
buying a new house, you often

1248
00:39:11,126 --> 00:39:12,116
end up buying a bunch of new

1249
00:39:12,116 --> 00:39:12,556
stuff.

1250
00:39:13,136 --> 00:39:14,816
And I started adding things to

1251
00:39:14,816 --> 00:39:16,706
my home and connecting things to

1252
00:39:16,706 --> 00:39:17,346
the network.

1253
00:39:17,966 --> 00:39:19,426
And I started finding a bunch of

1254
00:39:19,426 --> 00:39:20,896
stuff showing up in Bonjour.

1255
00:39:20,896 --> 00:39:22,246
Now, I bought a new printer; it

1256
00:39:22,246 --> 00:39:23,026
had Bonjour.

1257
00:39:23,236 --> 00:39:25,266
I bought some Access Network

1258
00:39:25,266 --> 00:39:26,786
security cameras, they had

1259
00:39:26,826 --> 00:39:27,316
Bonjour.

1260
00:39:27,316 --> 00:39:28,916
That didn't surprise me because

1261
00:39:28,916 --> 00:39:30,686
we know printers and network

1262
00:39:30,686 --> 00:39:31,956
cameras were among the first

1263
00:39:31,956 --> 00:39:33,386
devices to adopt Bonjour.

1264
00:39:35,056 --> 00:39:37,326
But then I got a surround sound

1265
00:39:37,326 --> 00:39:41,216
amplifier and it had Wi-Fi, and

1266
00:39:41,216 --> 00:39:43,276
it had an embedded web server

1267
00:39:43,546 --> 00:39:44,536
with Bonjour.

1268
00:39:45,066 --> 00:39:46,346
Now, you can set up the

1269
00:39:46,346 --> 00:39:47,946
amplifier with the TV and the

1270
00:39:47,946 --> 00:39:50,136
remote control, but naming the

1271
00:39:50,136 --> 00:39:51,956
inputs with up, down, left,

1272
00:39:51,956 --> 00:39:53,286
right on the remote control one

1273
00:39:53,286 --> 00:39:54,586
character at a time is really

1274
00:39:54,586 --> 00:39:55,056
tedious.

1275
00:39:55,396 --> 00:39:56,536
Being able to do this on my

1276
00:39:56,536 --> 00:39:58,966
laptop or on my 27-inch iMac

1277
00:39:59,126 --> 00:40:00,956
with a keyboard and a mouse is

1278
00:39:59,126 --> 00:40:00,956
with a keyboard and a mouse is

1279
00:40:00,956 --> 00:40:03,206
such a nicer way to set up a new

1280
00:40:03,206 --> 00:40:04,046
piece of equipment.

1281
00:40:04,166 --> 00:40:06,216
I bought another amplifier from

1282
00:40:06,216 --> 00:40:07,536
different company, it also had

1283
00:40:07,536 --> 00:40:08,116
Bonjour.

1284
00:40:08,826 --> 00:40:10,276
I got solar panels on the roof

1285
00:40:10,276 --> 00:40:11,556
of the house to save on the

1286
00:40:11,556 --> 00:40:13,516
electricity bill, the inverter

1287
00:40:13,836 --> 00:40:16,356
has Wi-Fi with an embedded web

1288
00:40:16,356 --> 00:40:18,696
server advertised with Bonjour.

1289
00:40:19,016 --> 00:40:21,166
So now with one click, I can see

1290
00:40:21,166 --> 00:40:22,966
a graph of how much power I've

1291
00:40:23,006 --> 00:40:25,056
produced in the day.

1292
00:40:25,056 --> 00:40:27,306
My most recent purchase was an

1293
00:40:27,306 --> 00:40:29,846
irrigation controller to control

1294
00:40:29,846 --> 00:40:30,996
the sprinklers that water my

1295
00:40:30,996 --> 00:40:31,606
lawn.

1296
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:34,136
It has Wi-Fi with an embedded

1297
00:40:34,136 --> 00:40:35,896
web server advertised with

1298
00:40:35,896 --> 00:40:36,586
Bonjour.

1299
00:40:37,166 --> 00:40:38,656
Compared to trying to program

1300
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:40,326
your garden sprinkles with a

1301
00:40:40,326 --> 00:40:42,196
two-digital LCD display and the

1302
00:40:42,246 --> 00:40:44,186
plus minus buttons, this is such

1303
00:40:44,186 --> 00:40:45,916
a glorious experience to see it

1304
00:40:45,916 --> 00:40:47,576
all on my big iMac screen at the

1305
00:40:47,576 --> 00:40:47,976
same time.

1306
00:40:48,516 --> 00:40:54,546
[ Applause ]

1307
00:40:55,046 --> 00:40:56,626
So thank you to all you device

1308
00:40:56,626 --> 00:40:57,696
makers who are making these

1309
00:40:57,696 --> 00:40:58,576
wonderful products.

1310
00:40:58,896 --> 00:41:00,646
For the app developers in the

1311
00:40:58,896 --> 00:41:00,646
For the app developers in the

1312
00:41:00,646 --> 00:41:03,446
room, how does this affect you?

1313
00:41:04,046 --> 00:41:05,906
The IETF DNS Service Discovery

1314
00:41:05,906 --> 00:41:07,696
Working Group continues to make

1315
00:41:07,726 --> 00:41:08,306
progress.

1316
00:41:09,686 --> 00:41:11,566
We have new enhancements to do

1317
00:41:11,566 --> 00:41:13,466
serve discovery on enterprise

1318
00:41:13,466 --> 00:41:15,266
networks where multicast is not

1319
00:41:15,266 --> 00:41:16,926
efficient and on new mesh

1320
00:41:16,926 --> 00:41:18,166
network technologies that like

1321
00:41:18,266 --> 00:41:19,686
Thread that don't support

1322
00:41:19,686 --> 00:41:20,516
multicast well.

1323
00:41:21,176 --> 00:41:22,756
The good news for app developers

1324
00:41:22,816 --> 00:41:23,826
is this is all completely

1325
00:41:23,826 --> 00:41:25,146
transparent to your apps.

1326
00:41:25,146 --> 00:41:26,796
The APIs haven't changed because

1327
00:41:26,796 --> 00:41:28,716
we anticipated these things even

1328
00:41:28,716 --> 00:41:29,666
15 years ago.

1329
00:41:30,276 --> 00:41:32,146
The only thing to remember is

1330
00:41:32,146 --> 00:41:33,876
when you do a browse call and

1331
00:41:33,876 --> 00:41:35,286
you get back a name, type, and

1332
00:41:35,286 --> 00:41:37,226
domain, pay attention to all

1333
00:41:37,226 --> 00:41:37,636
three.

1334
00:41:38,016 --> 00:41:41,256
You may be used to see the

1335
00:41:41,256 --> 00:41:43,136
domain always being local, but

1336
00:41:43,136 --> 00:41:44,266
now it may not be local.

1337
00:41:44,606 --> 00:41:46,816
So when you call resolve, make

1338
00:41:46,816 --> 00:41:48,476
sure to pass the name, type, and

1339
00:41:48,476 --> 00:41:49,616
domain you got from the browse

call.

1341
00:41:50,066 --> 00:41:51,796
And for the device makers out

1342
00:41:51,796 --> 00:41:54,006
there, don't forget to support

1343
00:41:54,176 --> 00:41:55,226
link-local addressing.

1344
00:41:55,326 --> 00:41:56,506
Link-local addressing is the

1345
00:41:56,506 --> 00:41:58,156
most reliable way to get to a

1346
00:41:58,156 --> 00:41:59,486
device on the local network

1347
00:42:00,316 --> 00:42:02,186
because if you can't configure

1348
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:03,726
it, you can't misconfigure it.

[ Laughter ]

1350
00:42:07,586 --> 00:42:10,066
So to wrap up, in part one we

1351
00:42:10,096 --> 00:42:12,386
talked about ongoing progress in

1352
00:42:12,486 --> 00:42:12,826
ECN.

1353
00:42:13,196 --> 00:42:14,636
It's now supported in clients

1354
00:42:14,636 --> 00:42:16,386
and servers, the stage is set.

1355
00:42:16,786 --> 00:42:18,636
Any ISP can now see an immediate

1356
00:42:18,636 --> 00:42:20,276
benefit for their customers by

1357
00:42:20,276 --> 00:42:21,996
turning on ECN at the key

1358
00:42:21,996 --> 00:42:22,896
bottleneck links.

1359
00:42:23,776 --> 00:42:25,196
Continue testing your apps on

1360
00:42:25,196 --> 00:42:25,626
NAT64.

1361
00:42:25,676 --> 00:42:29,026
Mostly known use there, we're

1362
00:42:29,026 --> 00:42:30,266
very happy everything is going

1363
00:42:30,266 --> 00:42:30,736
smoothly.

1364
00:42:32,766 --> 00:42:34,236
We have a move to user space

1365
00:42:34,236 --> 00:42:36,216
networking, which also doesn't

1366
00:42:36,216 --> 00:42:36,976
change the APIs.

1367
00:42:37,036 --> 00:42:39,126
But you may notice when you're

1368
00:42:39,166 --> 00:42:40,586
debugging and looking at stack

1369
00:42:40,586 --> 00:42:42,196
traces, you may see symbols in

1370
00:42:42,196 --> 00:42:43,366
the stack trace you're not used

1371
00:42:43,366 --> 00:42:43,496
to.

1372
00:42:43,496 --> 00:42:44,886
You may see differences in CPU

1373
00:42:44,886 --> 00:42:45,626
usage.

1374
00:42:45,986 --> 00:42:46,966
We wanted to you to be aware of

1375
00:42:46,966 --> 00:42:48,246
that so it didn't surprise you.

1376
00:42:49,196 --> 00:42:51,426
We have new capabilities in the

1377
00:42:51,426 --> 00:42:52,836
network extension framework.

1378
00:42:53,436 --> 00:42:55,116
And the big news, we have

1379
00:42:55,196 --> 00:42:58,346
multipath TCP as used by Siri

1380
00:42:58,496 --> 00:42:59,836
now available for your apps to

1381
00:42:59,836 --> 00:43:00,736
use as well.

1382
00:42:59,836 --> 00:43:00,736
use as well.

00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:02,706

1385
00:43:08,456 --> 00:43:10,526
In part two, we covered some

1386
00:43:10,526 --> 00:43:12,076
enhancements in URLSession,

1387
00:43:12,076 --> 00:43:12,736
especially the

1388
00:43:12,736 --> 00:43:14,656
waitsForConnectivity, which is

1389
00:43:14,656 --> 00:43:16,706
really networking APIs done the

1390
00:43:16,706 --> 00:43:18,326
way they always should have

1391
00:43:18,326 --> 00:43:18,576
done.

1392
00:43:18,856 --> 00:43:20,736
When you ask us to do something,

1393
00:43:21,106 --> 00:43:22,476
we should just do it, not bother

1394
00:43:22,476 --> 00:43:24,406
you with silly error messages

1395
00:43:24,406 --> 00:43:25,636
that it can't be done right now.

1396
00:43:25,776 --> 00:43:27,196
You ask us, we will do it when

1397
00:43:27,196 --> 00:43:27,566
we can.

1398
00:43:28,506 --> 00:43:29,736

1399
00:43:29,786 --> 00:43:33,296

00:43:42,586 --> 00:43:44,216
