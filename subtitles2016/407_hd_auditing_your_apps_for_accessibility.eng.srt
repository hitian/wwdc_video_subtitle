&gt;&gt; Good morning.

4
00:00:29,086 --> 00:00:30,796
My name is Susumu Harada.

5
00:00:30,796 --> 00:00:32,756
I'm an engineer on the

00:00:33,146 --> 00:00:35,166
And I'm here today with

7
00:00:35,576 --> 00:00:39,216
And we're really excited to

8
00:00:39,216 --> 00:00:43,206
that will make it easier than

9
00:00:43,346 --> 00:00:45,906
and fix accessibility

10
00:00:47,236 --> 00:00:49,296
So, some of you may be

11
00:00:49,526 --> 00:00:51,426
So let me quickly go

12
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:54,186
to make your app accessible

13
00:00:54,186 --> 00:00:56,616
that you may encounter

14
00:00:58,336 --> 00:01:01,176
So, accessibility

15
00:00:58,336 --> 00:01:01,176
So, accessibility

16
00:01:01,426 --> 00:01:05,446
that everyone can enjoy

17
00:01:05,446 --> 00:01:07,346
and the great apps

18
00:01:07,596 --> 00:01:10,876
regardless of their abilities.

19
00:01:10,876 --> 00:01:12,816
Now, some users may

20
00:01:12,816 --> 00:01:16,076
with their vision

21
00:01:16,646 --> 00:01:21,326
And some may experience

22
00:01:22,816 --> 00:01:24,586
or cognitive and

23
00:01:25,166 --> 00:01:29,586
So, to support this

24
00:01:30,106 --> 00:01:32,886
we at Apple have worked

25
00:01:32,886 --> 00:01:34,056
of assistive technologies

26
00:01:34,396 --> 00:01:38,056
that help augment various users'

27
00:01:38,086 --> 00:01:40,656
for people with visual

28
00:01:40,656 --> 00:01:42,416
for people with motor

29
00:01:42,746 --> 00:01:48,806
And we also made sure that these

30
00:01:48,806 --> 00:01:51,226
across all of our

31
00:01:51,226 --> 00:01:54,266
and iOS to watchOS and tvOS.

32
00:01:54,926 --> 00:01:59,146
And while these assistive

33
00:01:59,146 --> 00:02:01,126
enabling tools, the heart

34
00:01:59,146 --> 00:02:01,126
enabling tools, the heart

35
00:02:01,126 --> 00:02:03,996
of our users' experience are

36
00:02:04,506 --> 00:02:08,936
So to better get a sense

37
00:02:08,936 --> 00:02:11,576
with our assistive technologies

38
00:02:11,576 --> 00:02:14,576
that you may run into, let's

39
00:02:15,836 --> 00:02:18,816
So here I have a simple app that

40
00:02:19,236 --> 00:02:22,326
And it just presents a user with

41
00:02:22,646 --> 00:02:24,396
and four answer buttons

42
00:02:24,956 --> 00:02:27,376
And the user can tap

43
00:02:27,436 --> 00:02:29,936
and you get a feedback whether

44
00:02:30,406 --> 00:02:31,746
It's pretty straightforward.

45
00:02:31,936 --> 00:02:33,546
And it looks like its

46
00:02:34,176 --> 00:02:38,446
But how might a user who is

47
00:02:39,796 --> 00:02:44,266
So, obviously without any

48
00:02:44,266 --> 00:02:45,366
be able to see the screen.

49
00:02:45,676 --> 00:02:47,076
So, it's pretty useless.

50
00:02:47,776 --> 00:02:51,226
But fortunately, they can

51
00:02:51,226 --> 00:02:53,736
VoiceOver to have

52
00:02:53,736 --> 00:02:55,226
on the screen read out to them.

53
00:02:55,386 --> 00:02:58,336
And they can use various

54
00:02:58,336 --> 00:03:00,306
and interact with different

55
00:02:58,336 --> 00:03:00,306
and interact with different

56
00:03:00,856 --> 00:03:02,676
So, if this app is

57
00:03:03,086 --> 00:03:05,706
when the user touches on the

58
00:03:06,336 --> 00:03:09,276
VoiceOver will read

59
00:03:10,146 --> 00:03:14,606
Great. So what does the

60
00:03:14,606 --> 00:03:16,956
like VoiceOver need

61
00:03:16,956 --> 00:03:18,806
to present the interface

62
00:03:18,806 --> 00:03:21,366
So, there are several key

63
00:03:21,786 --> 00:03:24,476
But first it needs to know

64
00:03:24,476 --> 00:03:27,396
where all the important

65
00:03:28,836 --> 00:03:31,646
And for each of those elements

66
00:03:31,646 --> 00:03:35,616
or their types such as what is a

67
00:03:36,106 --> 00:03:41,116
And finally, it also needs

68
00:03:41,366 --> 00:03:44,476
that uniquely identifies that

69
00:03:44,506 --> 00:03:46,006
to the user in an

70
00:03:46,006 --> 00:03:51,916
So with these key pieces

71
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:54,626
and other assistive technologies

72
00:03:54,716 --> 00:03:57,586
to the user in a

73
00:03:57,586 --> 00:04:02,526
And all the accessibility

74
00:03:57,586 --> 00:04:02,526
And all the accessibility

75
00:04:02,526 --> 00:04:04,896
by the app through

76
00:04:05,856 --> 00:04:07,596
And we at Apple have

77
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:10,946
to build accessibility support

78
00:04:11,406 --> 00:04:14,866
so that if you build your apps

79
00:04:14,866 --> 00:04:17,305
of this accessibility

80
00:04:17,305 --> 00:04:19,206
in for you automatically

81
00:04:19,206 --> 00:04:22,416
And you don't have

82
00:04:23,086 --> 00:04:25,596
But of course, your apps

83
00:04:25,596 --> 00:04:26,416
custom controls.

84
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:28,836
And when they do, you

85
00:04:28,836 --> 00:04:30,736
of this accessibility

86
00:04:31,856 --> 00:04:34,506
And if you don't, you might end

87
00:04:35,176 --> 00:04:38,986
So let's see what the impact

88
00:04:38,986 --> 00:04:41,146
So, if I had implemented

89
00:04:41,146 --> 00:04:45,136
at the top using complete custom

90
00:04:45,136 --> 00:04:48,566
or OpenGL, so they don't have

91
00:04:48,566 --> 00:04:49,186
by default.

92
00:04:49,186 --> 00:04:51,666
So unless I explicitly

93
00:04:52,776 --> 00:04:55,336
they might be completely

94
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:56,656
and other assistive

95
00:04:57,176 --> 00:05:00,136
And with these four

96
00:04:57,176 --> 00:05:00,136
And with these four

97
00:05:00,446 --> 00:05:03,316
if I used custom views

98
00:05:03,706 --> 00:05:06,046
but forgot to indicate

99
00:05:06,196 --> 00:05:09,066
as being a button,

100
00:05:09,066 --> 00:05:10,786
and their users will

101
00:05:10,786 --> 00:05:12,566
that they can press on these.

102
00:05:14,036 --> 00:05:16,066
And finally, for the

103
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:18,876
if I implemented it using

104
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:23,616
and forgot to supply the

105
00:05:23,616 --> 00:05:26,126
VoiceOver will have no idea

106
00:05:26,356 --> 00:05:28,866
And the user will have no

107
00:05:29,936 --> 00:05:32,916
So you can see how if you're

108
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:36,016
information the user

109
00:05:36,016 --> 00:05:40,946
on assistive technology

110
00:05:41,076 --> 00:05:42,966
So obviously it's very important

111
00:05:42,966 --> 00:05:46,326
to make sure your app is

112
00:05:46,326 --> 00:05:48,216
that it has a positive

113
00:05:49,536 --> 00:05:51,206
But there's also

114
00:05:51,206 --> 00:05:52,936
to making sure your

115
00:05:53,026 --> 00:05:55,646
And that is a fully

116
00:05:56,216 --> 00:05:59,626
with a fully accessible app you

117
00:05:59,626 --> 00:06:02,966
for it using Xcode's

118
00:05:59,626 --> 00:06:02,966
for it using Xcode's

119
00:06:03,836 --> 00:06:06,306
And for more information on

120
00:06:06,306 --> 00:06:08,676
to check out UI Testing

121
00:06:08,676 --> 00:06:10,706
from last year's WWDC.

122
00:06:13,746 --> 00:06:15,506
Great. So, how can you make sure

123
00:06:15,506 --> 00:06:17,576
that your app is

124
00:06:17,576 --> 00:06:18,756
accessibility information?

125
00:06:19,316 --> 00:06:22,556
Well, one method that

126
00:06:22,636 --> 00:06:25,506
to use the actual assistive

127
00:06:25,506 --> 00:06:27,266
and Switch control

128
00:06:27,816 --> 00:06:29,876
Now, this is still

129
00:06:30,176 --> 00:06:33,346
since you can mirror the

130
00:06:33,436 --> 00:06:36,836
and also catch usability

131
00:06:36,836 --> 00:06:37,966
that something is accessible.

132
00:06:38,976 --> 00:06:41,766
But it does require that

133
00:06:41,766 --> 00:06:42,876
to use these technologies.

134
00:06:43,946 --> 00:06:46,376
And especially if your app

135
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:49,026
you might find it quite

136
00:06:49,066 --> 00:06:51,796
to repeatedly deploy your

137
00:06:52,296 --> 00:06:54,766
run through it using each of

138
00:06:55,116 --> 00:06:57,706
and repeat the process

139
00:06:58,266 --> 00:07:02,936
And all those platforms also

140
00:06:58,266 --> 00:07:02,936
And all those platforms also

141
00:07:03,066 --> 00:07:04,956
settings that the

142
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:07,646
such the Dynamic Type font size.

143
00:07:08,106 --> 00:07:12,906
And you as a developer might

144
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:15,696
to go and switch back and forth

145
00:07:15,736 --> 00:07:17,596
between changing the

146
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:21,626
going back to your app,

147
00:07:21,626 --> 00:07:22,666
and repeating the process.

148
00:07:24,086 --> 00:07:25,916
So, we've heard all

149
00:07:26,186 --> 00:07:30,486
And today we're very excited

150
00:07:30,486 --> 00:07:32,006
and more streamlined alternative

151
00:07:32,196 --> 00:07:35,846
to auditing your apps using the

152
00:07:39,046 --> 00:07:40,956
And in the new Accessibility

153
00:07:42,026 --> 00:07:43,816
with just a single

154
00:07:44,356 --> 00:07:45,966
it can automatically

155
00:07:46,186 --> 00:07:47,666
for common accessibility issues.

156
00:07:48,036 --> 00:07:49,066
It's super easy.

157
00:07:49,196 --> 00:07:52,226
And it even suggests to you

158
00:07:52,816 --> 00:07:57,136
And in the Interactive

159
00:07:57,136 --> 00:07:59,156
easily, point at any

160
00:07:59,156 --> 00:08:01,606
and get very detailed

161
00:07:59,156 --> 00:08:01,606
and get very detailed

162
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:02,086
about them.

163
00:08:02,686 --> 00:08:05,666
And this works whether your

164
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:07,256
or on a connected device.

165
00:08:07,826 --> 00:08:13,796
And we also offer a live

166
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:15,926
which lets you really easily go

167
00:08:15,926 --> 00:08:17,416
and change an accessibility

168
00:08:17,556 --> 00:08:19,876
and immediately see

169
00:08:20,176 --> 00:08:23,766
without having to

170
00:08:24,026 --> 00:08:26,246
And we're really

171
00:08:26,446 --> 00:08:30,166
that this Accessibility

172
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:30,906
of our platforms.

173
00:08:31,436 --> 00:08:35,416
This means that with a single

174
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:39,506
on your desktop you can audit

175
00:08:39,506 --> 00:08:44,096
on macOS and iOS,

176
00:08:44,476 --> 00:08:48,306
And you can do this simply

177
00:08:48,306 --> 00:08:50,056
on the simulator or on a device

178
00:08:50,556 --> 00:08:53,126
and choosing the respective

179
00:08:53,626 --> 00:08:54,306
It's that easy.

180

00:08:54,896 --> 00:09:01,246
And we hope that with this

00:09:01,246 --> 00:09:03,826
than ever for you to test

183

across all of our platforms.

00:09:32,656 --> 00:09:37,856
And so I can't wait to

194
00:09:38,476 --> 00:09:42,516
So, to note, Accessibility

195
00:09:42,516 --> 00:09:43,906
of the developer package.

196
00:09:44,256 --> 00:09:46,686
That means you can

197
00:09:47,116 --> 00:09:50,306
under the Open Developer

198
00:09:50,926 --> 00:09:53,076
and launch the Accessibility

199
00:09:53,986 --> 00:09:57,726
So here is a screenshot of

200
00:09:57,726 --> 00:10:00,786
I want to bring your attention

201
00:09:57,726 --> 00:10:00,786
I want to bring your attention

202
00:10:01,376 --> 00:10:05,386
On the left we have what

203
00:10:05,966 --> 00:10:10,356
That allows you to inspect all

204
00:10:10,396 --> 00:10:12,946
that we have, including

205
00:10:13,706 --> 00:10:15,356
your desktop machine,

206
00:10:15,396 --> 00:10:17,226
your TV and the simulators.

207
00:10:17,786 --> 00:10:22,996
In the middle we have what we

208
00:10:23,536 --> 00:10:25,276
Now, when you have this enabled,

209
00:10:25,676 --> 00:10:29,676
then the tool can

210
00:10:29,676 --> 00:10:31,476
under your finger

211
00:10:32,266 --> 00:10:35,906
Or if you're in a simulator

212
00:10:36,226 --> 00:10:37,396
under your mouse cursor.

213
00:10:37,396 --> 00:10:41,966
Then on the right we

214
00:10:43,546 --> 00:10:46,276
These are three major

215
00:10:46,936 --> 00:10:48,646
And this is what I'll

216
00:10:48,646 --> 00:10:51,406
of the session telling you

217
00:10:51,406 --> 00:10:52,606
of these three features.

218
00:10:53,256 --> 00:10:54,726
So what are these

219
00:10:55,646 --> 00:10:57,266
First, we have Inspection.

220
00:10:58,056 --> 00:11:01,056
The Inspection feature

221
00:10:58,056 --> 00:11:01,056
The Inspection feature

222
00:11:01,056 --> 00:11:04,816
and analyze the accessibility

223
00:11:05,296 --> 00:11:07,866
Then we have the Audit

224
00:11:07,866 --> 00:11:10,586
to find accessibility

225
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:15,696
And last we have the Settings

226
00:11:15,696 --> 00:11:20,236
to quickly test how accessibly

227
00:11:21,376 --> 00:11:25,046
So the first one I want to talk

228
00:11:26,336 --> 00:11:29,456
So, ultimately your goal is

229
00:11:29,516 --> 00:11:32,556
to make sure your app is

230
00:11:33,206 --> 00:11:36,396
And to do that you need

231
00:11:36,736 --> 00:11:39,186
Now, earlier Susumu

232
00:11:39,186 --> 00:11:43,406
if you could actually run with

233
00:11:43,586 --> 00:11:44,786
and audit your app that way.

234
00:11:45,796 --> 00:11:48,466
Or you could also hire an

235
00:11:48,466 --> 00:11:50,056
to do the evaluation

236
00:11:50,746 --> 00:11:54,196
But today, I'm going to show

237
00:11:54,406 --> 00:11:55,666
to get that solution.

238
00:11:55,666 --> 00:12:03,406
And that is simply use our

239
00:11:55,666 --> 00:12:03,406
And that is simply use our

240
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:07,736
And so, in our Audit tab we

241
00:12:08,176 --> 00:12:10,346
And the best way to

242
00:12:10,346 --> 00:12:12,266
about this feature is

243
00:12:22,056 --> 00:12:25,076
So I have here on the

244
00:12:25,076 --> 00:12:29,896
of the iOS version of the

245
00:12:29,896 --> 00:12:30,696
in the simulator.

246
00:12:30,696 --> 00:12:33,656
And so you could play a game.

247
00:12:33,656 --> 00:12:34,486
We have equation.

248
00:12:34,756 --> 00:12:36,626
We could pick one

249
00:12:37,266 --> 00:12:38,026
Not that one.

250
00:12:38,026 --> 00:12:38,836
This one. There.

251
00:12:38,836 --> 00:12:43,106
So that's how you play the game.

252
00:12:44,006 --> 00:12:47,026
Okay. So now I want to launch

253
00:12:48,606 --> 00:12:51,446
So, I simply go to Xcode.

254
00:12:51,796 --> 00:12:59,256
And on the top, under

255
00:12:59,256 --> 00:13:02,356
we're going to launch the

256
00:12:59,256 --> 00:13:02,356
we're going to launch the

257
00:13:02,966 --> 00:13:08,316
So the first thing you

258
00:13:08,426 --> 00:13:10,126
which device you

259
00:13:11,486 --> 00:13:15,166
So in our Target Chooser, I'm

260
00:13:18,816 --> 00:13:21,616
And then we'll click

261
00:13:21,616 --> 00:13:24,826
And here's that Run Audit

262
00:13:25,486 --> 00:13:29,106
So I'm going to go

263
00:13:29,326 --> 00:13:32,566
In a split second we've

264
00:13:33,066 --> 00:13:35,556
And here are the

265
00:13:36,206 --> 00:13:38,976
You can now select that.

266
00:13:39,326 --> 00:13:40,926
As you cycle through

267
00:13:41,206 --> 00:13:44,396
you'll note that there's a

268
00:13:44,466 --> 00:13:46,476
over the area where

269
00:13:47,066 --> 00:13:52,116
And of course, if you're

270
00:13:52,116 --> 00:13:56,916
like iPhone or iPad, this is

271
00:13:57,396 --> 00:14:00,706
So, now if you want to

272
00:13:57,396 --> 00:14:00,706
So, now if you want to

273
00:14:00,926 --> 00:14:03,466
you will have to take your

274
00:14:03,836 --> 00:14:06,186
and look on your iPad or iPhone.

275
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:10,966
So what we have here is

276
00:14:11,086 --> 00:14:13,816
just give you a little

277
00:14:14,176 --> 00:14:16,946
of that same element that

278
00:14:16,946 --> 00:14:17,326
in the tools.

279
00:14:17,326 --> 00:14:20,346
So you could keep your eye

280
00:14:22,136 --> 00:14:22,716
All right.

281
00:14:22,806 --> 00:14:24,006
So we have these issues.

282
00:14:24,976 --> 00:14:27,466
So what's the next thing

283
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:29,096
Go fix it.

284
00:14:29,546 --> 00:14:30,876
So let's pick one of

285
00:14:31,986 --> 00:14:33,166
Element has no description.

286
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:38,056
And click on the disclosure

287
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:39,116
to get more information.

288
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:42,086
All right.

289
00:14:42,246 --> 00:14:44,586
So element has no description.

290
00:14:45,056 --> 00:14:46,836
What does that correspond

291
00:14:46,836 --> 00:14:49,366
Do you know which

292
00:14:50,576 --> 00:14:53,356
Well, if you went online,

293
00:14:53,356 --> 00:14:56,456
about the accessibility API

294
00:14:56,496 --> 00:14:57,816
on how to fix this issue.

295
00:14:58,486 --> 00:15:00,906
But today I'm going to show you

296
00:14:58,486 --> 00:15:00,906
But today I'm going to show you

297
00:15:01,896 --> 00:15:03,506
Simply click on this

298
00:15:04,836 --> 00:15:07,546
And the tool will tell

299
00:15:08,356 --> 00:15:11,456
It says: Consider setting

300
00:15:12,616 --> 00:15:15,556
So, at this point, if you

301
00:15:15,756 --> 00:15:18,596
you would just go right into

302
00:15:19,276 --> 00:15:22,596
But if you want more information

303
00:15:23,296 --> 00:15:24,886
you could click on

304
00:15:25,846 --> 00:15:27,626
which then will take you to --

305
00:15:27,936 --> 00:15:30,476
eventually take you to

306
00:15:30,476 --> 00:15:34,836
where you could find more

307
00:15:37,256 --> 00:15:38,296
All right?

308
00:15:38,296 --> 00:15:41,546
Since now I know which API

309
00:15:41,546 --> 00:15:43,366
into the code and fix it up.

310
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:53,056
So, what I'm fixing

311
00:15:53,386 --> 00:15:54,216
with the dots in there.

312
00:15:54,876 --> 00:15:58,986
And the way it's implemented,

313
00:15:59,866 --> 00:16:03,546
So now I'm simply going

314
00:15:59,866 --> 00:16:03,546
So now I'm simply going

315
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:07,536
to override the accessibility

316
00:16:08,226 --> 00:16:16,346
And I'm going to return a string

317
00:16:16,346 --> 00:16:20,796
And of course, you should

318
00:16:22,336 --> 00:16:24,616
Okay? So now I have my

319
00:16:25,936 --> 00:16:29,246
I'm going to save it,

320
00:16:41,286 --> 00:16:43,076
Okay, let's go back to Addition.

321
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:47,906
And let's clear out

322
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:52,966
And rerun the Audit.

323
00:16:53,516 --> 00:16:55,486
With that simple

324
00:16:56,066 --> 00:16:58,096
we've just fixed up

325
00:16:58,396 --> 00:16:58,946
Isn't that great?

326

[ Applause ]

327
00:17:07,046 --> 00:17:07,316
All right.

328
00:17:07,756 --> 00:17:12,286
So, note that this same powerful

329
00:17:12,286 --> 00:17:15,146
by other teams of your

330
00:17:15,146 --> 00:17:17,026
to do an assessment

331
00:17:17,705 --> 00:17:22,356
And of course, then they will

332
00:17:23,986 --> 00:17:27,185
So, to speed up the process

333
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:30,066
they can now just,

334
00:17:30,236 --> 00:17:33,506
they could simply copy and

335
00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:38,366
And of course, every good bug

336
00:17:39,716 --> 00:17:42,736
So we have here this

337
00:17:44,006 --> 00:17:48,046
If I click on that, you should

338
00:17:48,496 --> 00:17:49,766
of your entire screen,

339
00:17:50,336 --> 00:17:53,426
plus where the problem

340
00:17:54,016 --> 00:17:55,666
So again, you could

341
00:17:57,386 --> 00:17:58,976
and paste it into

342
00:17:59,186 --> 00:18:00,746
And now you're ready

343
00:17:59,186 --> 00:18:00,746
And now you're ready

[ Applause ]

345
00:18:17,436 --> 00:18:17,726
All right.

346
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:22,696
So what you've just seen is how

347
00:18:22,736 --> 00:18:25,936
auto-detect problems

348
00:18:25,936 --> 00:18:27,646
It could give you

And even speed up the process

350
00:18:32,906 --> 00:18:36,006
As powerful and as

351
00:18:36,046 --> 00:18:39,676
in helping you detect

352
00:18:39,676 --> 00:18:44,436
similar to the compile

353
00:18:45,776 --> 00:18:49,906
having no warning does not

any problem.

355
00:18:51,586 --> 00:18:53,306
So that's why it's

356
00:18:53,306 --> 00:18:55,366
of that manual auditing

357
00:18:55,886 --> 00:19:00,826
And to show you why

358

And to show you why

359
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:03,046
let me give you an example.

360
00:19:03,686 --> 00:19:07,136
So, suppose you have a button

361
00:19:07,786 --> 00:19:09,566
and its function

362
00:19:10,446 --> 00:19:13,046
Of course, the button comes

363
00:19:14,676 --> 00:19:16,956
One thing we tend to

364
00:19:16,956 --> 00:19:19,966
to create a new button

365
00:19:19,966 --> 00:19:22,596
of these existing button

366
00:19:22,596 --> 00:19:25,836
And of course, that

367
00:19:26,156 --> 00:19:27,566
of that button gets transferred.

368
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:31,016
And we go and tweak

369
00:19:31,016 --> 00:19:35,296
like the actions and the icons.

370
00:19:36,026 --> 00:19:37,136
That's fine.

371
00:19:37,956 --> 00:19:38,896
That's all good.

372
00:19:39,006 --> 00:19:44,176
Except if you forget to

373
00:19:44,176 --> 00:19:45,056
that could be a problem.

374
00:19:45,356 --> 00:19:46,486
Especially in this case,

375
00:19:46,536 --> 00:19:48,656
it's the accessibility

376
00:19:50,566 --> 00:19:52,816
For assistive clients

377
00:19:53,486 --> 00:19:56,476
the accessibility label

00:19:56,476 --> 00:19:59,226
Because that's the only

379
00:19:59,226 --> 00:20:01,386
about how this button functions.

380
00:19:59,226 --> 00:20:01,386
about how this button functions.

381
00:20:02,946 --> 00:20:06,926
So, if an assistive client

382
00:20:06,926 --> 00:20:10,366
on this button, and you haven't

383
00:20:10,366 --> 00:20:11,926
it still says Send Mail.

384
00:20:11,926 --> 00:20:14,866
But they're going to

385
00:20:14,866 --> 00:20:15,806
that they're sending a mail.

386
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:18,466
In fact, they've just

387
00:20:18,466 --> 00:20:20,596
So that's not a great outcome.

388
00:20:21,226 --> 00:20:27,636
And so for that, we're

389
00:20:27,636 --> 00:20:30,086
through that manual

390
00:20:30,466 --> 00:20:32,466
And that's why I want to

391
00:20:36,316 --> 00:20:38,916
So let me give you some

392
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:40,266
and show you how that helps you

393
00:20:40,346 --> 00:20:42,186
through the manual

394
00:20:42,646 --> 00:20:44,836
So, suppose we have

395
00:20:44,876 --> 00:20:45,916
that has eight dots in there.

396
00:20:46,776 --> 00:20:52,866
In the Inspection tab on the top

397
00:20:52,866 --> 00:20:58,846
And on the left side we have

398
00:20:59,226 --> 00:21:02,186
or give you a summary of how

399
00:20:59,226 --> 00:21:02,186
or give you a summary of how

400
00:21:02,546 --> 00:21:06,606
So in this case the eight-dot

401
00:21:07,196 --> 00:21:09,646
And to the right there's

402
00:21:09,646 --> 00:21:11,846
that allows you to

403
00:21:11,846 --> 00:21:16,346
to the neighboring UI

404
00:21:16,536 --> 00:21:18,056
from this button here.

405
00:21:19,076 --> 00:21:22,026
Then below we have

406
00:21:22,876 --> 00:21:26,966
that contains properties that's

407
00:21:27,676 --> 00:21:30,436
So for example, we have

408
00:21:30,436 --> 00:21:31,796
to Accessibility Label.

409
00:21:32,066 --> 00:21:33,486
And returns the value 8.

410
00:21:33,596 --> 00:21:34,856
And we have Trait.

411
00:21:35,016 --> 00:21:37,096
In this case, it's a

412
00:21:38,776 --> 00:21:41,076
And as this button

413
00:21:42,156 --> 00:21:45,286
you'll look into the

414
00:21:45,286 --> 00:21:48,216
that there's Activate

415
00:21:48,656 --> 00:21:52,006
And so you could simply click

416
00:21:52,346 --> 00:21:53,316
that this action works.

417
00:21:56,256 --> 00:21:58,146
So that's a highlight

418
00:21:58,256 --> 00:22:03,346
Let me go ahead and

419
00:21:58,256 --> 00:22:03,346
Let me go ahead and

420
00:22:12,096 --> 00:22:12,866
All right.

421
00:22:12,866 --> 00:22:15,846
So we're back here on our app.

422
00:22:15,846 --> 00:22:18,226
And now we're going to go

423
00:22:19,486 --> 00:22:23,116
So remember earlier I mentioned

424
00:22:23,786 --> 00:22:26,366
Right now it's enabled, which

425
00:22:26,456 --> 00:22:32,316
over the items in the simulator,

426
00:22:32,316 --> 00:22:33,626
that element under the cursor.

427
00:22:34,156 --> 00:22:35,976
And you can see that

428
00:22:36,976 --> 00:22:41,726
So on the simulator in desktop,

429
00:22:42,256 --> 00:22:46,576
on that item, it will turn

430
00:22:47,016 --> 00:22:49,466
which then allows you

431
00:22:49,466 --> 00:22:51,946
around without affecting

432
00:22:52,966 --> 00:22:55,296
So right now we're

433
00:22:55,296 --> 00:22:56,866
And you see a description

434
00:22:57,676 --> 00:23:01,106
Now, I could click on the

435
00:22:57,676 --> 00:23:01,106
Now, I could click on the

436
00:23:01,706 --> 00:23:04,466
And you'll see the highlight

437
00:23:04,976 --> 00:23:08,166
Click again and we

438
00:23:08,166 --> 00:23:09,466
And also you get a description.

439
00:23:09,466 --> 00:23:10,326
This is the four-dot.

440
00:23:11,726 --> 00:23:16,846
Note that we completely

441
00:23:17,096 --> 00:23:17,816
The equation.

442
00:23:19,016 --> 00:23:21,686
So simply doing this

443
00:23:21,686 --> 00:23:24,206
of find issues along the way.

444
00:23:24,206 --> 00:23:26,896
In this case we might have a

445
00:23:27,896 --> 00:23:29,136
Let's keep going.

446
00:23:30,506 --> 00:23:32,886
So, we're on the

447
00:23:34,116 --> 00:23:36,046
And down to this

448
00:23:36,376 --> 00:23:39,376
Except the description

449
00:23:39,466 --> 00:23:41,536
IMG 0151. Hmm.

450
00:23:41,966 --> 00:23:42,686
Doesn't sound right.

451
00:23:42,686 --> 00:23:45,556
So, again, that may be

452
00:23:46,226 --> 00:23:48,156
where you need to fix it up.

453
00:23:48,616 --> 00:23:52,206
So, if you could simply use

454
00:23:52,626 --> 00:23:57,586
navigate through all the

455
00:23:57,586 --> 00:23:59,586
that all the description

456
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:01,226
then you're on the right track.

457
00:24:02,186 --> 00:24:06,266
And of course, if you have

458
00:24:06,326 --> 00:24:08,946
like these buttons,

459
00:24:08,946 --> 00:24:14,186
to the Action Section and, in

460
00:24:14,186 --> 00:24:16,566
on the Perform button

461
00:24:16,926 --> 00:24:19,176
to verify the action works.

462
00:24:19,716 --> 00:24:21,376
All right.

463
00:24:21,766 --> 00:24:25,376
So what I've just shown you is

464
00:24:25,896 --> 00:24:30,776
to help you along with your

465
00:24:30,906 --> 00:24:36,706
Now the Inspection is also great

466
00:24:36,746 --> 00:24:39,726
and analysis of the

467
00:24:40,956 --> 00:24:43,806
An example of that is

468
00:24:43,806 --> 00:24:47,556
accessibility hierarchy works,

469
00:24:47,556 --> 00:24:49,926
especially on an OS X app

470
00:24:49,926 --> 00:24:52,626
where the corresponding

471
00:24:52,846 --> 00:24:53,886
to be more complex.

472
00:24:54,806 --> 00:24:57,186
So to show you how this

473
00:24:57,186 --> 00:25:00,326
and launch the OS X

474
00:24:57,186 --> 00:25:00,326
and launch the OS X

475
00:25:07,426 --> 00:25:07,736
All right?

476
00:25:07,916 --> 00:25:11,626
So I have here the OS X

477
00:25:11,916 --> 00:25:13,506
And let's do something a

478
00:25:13,736 --> 00:25:14,856
multiplication.

479
00:25:16,046 --> 00:25:17,926
And so then when you

480
00:25:17,926 --> 00:25:19,856
&gt;&gt; Sorry, try again.

481
00:25:19,856 --> 00:25:20,766
&gt;&gt; -- that, how about this?

482
00:25:20,766 --> 00:25:22,176
&gt;&gt; Incorrect.

483
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:22,876
Try again.

484
00:25:22,876 --> 00:25:24,026
&gt;&gt; -- 6. 18.

485
00:25:24,026 --> 00:25:24,476
&gt;&gt; Correct.

486
00:25:25,546 --> 00:25:27,076
&gt;&gt; Okay, so you play

487
00:25:27,076 --> 00:25:28,646
And you know, this app works.

488
00:25:29,116 --> 00:25:32,446
We have the same version

489
00:25:32,446 --> 00:25:32,616
All right.

490
00:25:33,436 --> 00:25:38,156
So the first thing you

491
00:25:38,156 --> 00:25:41,046
that you're inspecting

492
00:25:42,006 --> 00:25:45,136
So, we're going to go

493
00:25:45,136 --> 00:25:48,056
because we're inspecting the

494
00:25:48,266 --> 00:25:50,096
And in this case we

495
00:25:50,156 --> 00:25:51,516
which app we want to inspect.

496
00:25:51,896 --> 00:25:53,216
So I'm going to pick

497
00:25:53,776 --> 00:25:59,076
And again, we could run Audit

498
00:25:59,466 --> 00:26:00,726
And it found a bunch of issues.

499
00:25:59,466 --> 00:26:00,726
And it found a bunch of issues.

500
00:26:01,806 --> 00:26:05,616
I want to bring your attention

501
00:26:06,366 --> 00:26:08,276
It says: "Potentially

502
00:26:08,756 --> 00:26:11,286
So the way these answer

503
00:26:11,286 --> 00:26:14,136
they were simply custom NSview.

504
00:26:14,666 --> 00:26:17,206
That's drawing those

505
00:26:18,106 --> 00:26:21,246
Now, by default, CA layers

506
00:26:21,876 --> 00:26:23,206
Which means if you create them,

507
00:26:24,086 --> 00:26:27,266
clients like VoiceOver is not

508
00:26:27,266 --> 00:26:29,066
And so the tool is

509
00:26:29,376 --> 00:26:30,596
that these are not accessible.

510
00:26:30,596 --> 00:26:33,336
So to understand

511
00:26:33,336 --> 00:26:36,626
it helps to know how the

512
00:26:38,196 --> 00:26:39,626
So let's go to the Inspection.

513
00:26:40,166 --> 00:26:43,916
And again, I'm going to

514
00:26:44,976 --> 00:26:47,866
And so if I bring my

515
00:26:47,866 --> 00:26:49,646
it's going to inspect

516
00:26:50,156 --> 00:26:50,966
What I'm interested

517
00:26:50,966 --> 00:26:53,566
in to inspect right now

518
00:26:54,496 --> 00:26:56,656
And the reason is

519
00:26:56,916 --> 00:26:59,936
who are the children

520
00:27:00,566 --> 00:27:04,686
So, the way I could I look

521
00:27:05,266 --> 00:27:07,066
under the hierarchy

522
00:27:07,646 --> 00:27:12,756
And then here are all the

523
00:27:13,346 --> 00:27:16,366
So, I'm on the equation.

524
00:27:16,366 --> 00:27:17,656
You can see that red highlight.

525
00:27:18,426 --> 00:27:19,746
On the image.

526
00:27:20,726 --> 00:27:21,966
Some status text.

527
00:27:21,966 --> 00:27:25,136
And a bunch of stuff in

528
00:27:25,906 --> 00:27:30,516
So right now, those four crucial

529
00:27:30,516 --> 00:27:32,446
exist as children of the window.

530
00:27:33,816 --> 00:27:35,496
And so we know we need

531
00:27:35,956 --> 00:27:38,106
But today I'm not going to

532
00:27:39,076 --> 00:27:41,256
Instead, I'm going to refer you

533
00:27:41,256 --> 00:27:44,926
to our sample code

534
00:27:45,506 --> 00:27:47,916
It's something to download

535
00:27:48,696 --> 00:27:51,006
This sample app contains

536
00:27:51,006 --> 00:27:52,696
with different UI scenarios

537
00:27:53,086 --> 00:27:56,116
and how you could add

538
00:27:56,906 --> 00:27:58,166
So I encourage you to do that.

539
00:27:58,986 --> 00:28:01,676
And once you fix it up, I expect

540
00:27:58,986 --> 00:28:01,676
And once you fix it up, I expect

541
00:28:01,786 --> 00:28:05,986
that those four answer choice

542
00:28:05,986 --> 00:28:08,136
as children of this window.

543
00:28:08,356 --> 00:28:11,516
So you could verify

544
00:28:17,156 --> 00:28:18,866
So, what I've shown you

545
00:28:18,866 --> 00:28:21,816
so far is how you can use

546
00:28:21,816 --> 00:28:24,296
to help you do some of

547
00:28:25,106 --> 00:28:27,416
And also how you could

548
00:28:27,716 --> 00:28:30,136
to do some more debugging

549
00:28:30,136 --> 00:28:31,966
of the accessibility

550
00:28:33,136 --> 00:28:39,246
The next thing I want to

551
00:28:39,726 --> 00:28:43,336
So, on every OS platform

552
00:28:43,336 --> 00:28:45,106
many accessibility settings.

553
00:28:45,536 --> 00:28:47,126
That comes built right in.

554
00:28:48,026 --> 00:28:54,486
So for example, on the

555
00:28:54,756 --> 00:28:58,786
under General Accessibility

556
00:28:58,786 --> 00:29:01,546
many wonderful accessibility

557
00:28:58,786 --> 00:29:01,546
many wonderful accessibility

558
00:29:02,106 --> 00:29:04,146
And settings like Toggle.

559
00:29:04,786 --> 00:29:09,006
So let's say if you want to

560
00:29:09,006 --> 00:29:09,926
your app.

561
00:29:09,926 --> 00:29:15,206
You could go in, adjust the font

562
00:29:16,086 --> 00:29:16,806
Then go back to your app.

563
00:29:18,066 --> 00:29:21,526
And then visually verify how a

564
00:29:22,256 --> 00:29:24,016
Then you could go back

565
00:29:25,856 --> 00:29:27,926
Readjust to something

566
00:29:28,456 --> 00:29:35,406
Then see how a small

567
00:29:35,686 --> 00:29:38,936
Now, you could see that this

568

600
00:31:35,076 --> 00:31:37,006
