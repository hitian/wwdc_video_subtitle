00:00:20,106 --> 00:00:20,656
&gt;&gt; Hi everyone.

3
00:00:20,866 --> 00:00:22,246
I'm Conor Hughes, an engineer

4
00:00:22,246 --> 00:00:23,746
on the Accessibility

5
00:00:24,126 --> 00:00:26,086
And welcome to What's

6
00:00:26,786 --> 00:00:29,166
Today we're going to learn about

7
00:00:29,166 --> 00:00:31,746
in our operating systems and

8
00:00:31,746 --> 00:00:34,776
to know to make sure your

9
00:00:35,266 --> 00:00:36,166
So let's get started.

10
00:00:37,196 --> 00:00:39,116
So accessibility is a big word

11
00:00:39,116 --> 00:00:40,316
and many are not

12
00:00:40,646 --> 00:00:41,286
What does it mean?

13
00:00:41,546 --> 00:00:44,636
To us, accessibility means

14
00:00:44,636 --> 00:00:47,216
for everyone, with all

15
00:00:48,086 --> 00:00:50,316
This means both designing

16
00:00:50,316 --> 00:00:52,166
with different needs

17
00:00:52,166 --> 00:00:54,056
about your basic

18
00:00:54,806 --> 00:00:57,886
This being WWDC, we're going

19
00:00:57,886 --> 00:00:59,856
on Apple platforms

20
00:00:59,856 --> 00:01:02,436
with four major classes

21
00:00:59,856 --> 00:01:02,436
with four major classes

22
00:01:02,706 --> 00:01:04,775
vision, hearing and learning.

23
00:01:06,586 --> 00:01:08,666
Motor encompasses

24
00:01:08,666 --> 00:01:11,446
and Multiple Sclerosis and

25
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:14,646
to push with force on the screen

26
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:18,316
Vision accommodations

27
00:01:18,316 --> 00:01:19,596
and partial vision loss.

28
00:01:21,416 --> 00:01:23,626
Hearing covers hearing

29
00:01:24,946 --> 00:01:27,686
And learning, which includes

30
00:01:28,106 --> 00:01:31,266
Our operating systems can do a

31
00:01:31,266 --> 00:01:32,356
in all of these areas.

32
00:01:32,776 --> 00:01:35,466
But apps are a core part of

33
00:01:35,776 --> 00:01:38,236
So for our platforms to be

34
00:01:38,496 --> 00:01:41,216
we need you to make sure your

35
00:01:41,536 --> 00:01:43,626
which is why we're so happy

36
00:01:43,626 --> 00:01:44,866
about how to do just that.

37
00:01:45,336 --> 00:01:47,016
So let's go over what we're

38
00:01:47,556 --> 00:01:49,926
First we'll go over some of

39
00:01:49,926 --> 00:01:52,916
in Mac OS, iOS, watchOS and tvOS

40
00:01:52,916 --> 00:01:55,316
so you can see some

41
00:01:55,316 --> 00:01:57,566
of how software can

42
00:01:57,566 --> 00:01:58,666
for people with different needs.

43
00:01:59,276 --> 00:02:01,906
Then we'll take an iOS app

44
00:01:59,276 --> 00:02:01,906
Then we'll take an iOS app

45
00:02:01,906 --> 00:02:03,116
for accessibility issues.

46
00:02:04,476 --> 00:02:06,566
Then dig into the

47
00:02:06,566 --> 00:02:08,336
to make sure your

48
00:02:09,735 --> 00:02:11,376
And finally, we'll

49
00:02:11,376 --> 00:02:13,516
to fix the issues we

50
00:02:13,746 --> 00:02:16,626
including using some new API

51
00:02:17,076 --> 00:02:19,046
So what new assistive features

52
00:02:19,596 --> 00:02:22,386
Well, there are quite a few, so

53
00:02:22,386 --> 00:02:24,736
at what's new in

54
00:02:26,316 --> 00:02:27,436
First off, motor.

55
00:02:28,086 --> 00:02:32,476
So some people may only be able

56
00:02:32,476 --> 00:02:34,186
through pressing a

57
00:02:34,186 --> 00:02:36,896
for instance a switch on

58
00:02:37,566 --> 00:02:40,096
They can interact with the

59
00:02:40,096 --> 00:02:42,946
for instance, through Switch

60
00:02:42,946 --> 00:02:45,156
which moves through the

61
00:02:46,026 --> 00:02:47,966
When someone wants to

62
00:02:47,966 --> 00:02:49,926
under the cursor, they

63
00:02:50,556 --> 00:02:53,326
Switch Control lets people with

64
00:02:53,326 --> 00:02:55,596
from simple taps to

65
00:02:56,696 --> 00:02:59,646
iOS and OS X have had Switch

66
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:00,176
So what's new?

67
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:00,176
So what's new?

68
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:02,946
Well, we're excited to announce

69
00:03:02,946 --> 00:03:05,066
that we're bringing

70
00:03:05,716 --> 00:03:07,646
Now, people who use

71
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:09,916
to directly interact

72
00:03:10,586 --> 00:03:12,886
The familiar Switch interface

73
00:03:12,886 --> 00:03:14,216
that highlights elements

74
00:03:15,036 --> 00:03:17,256
Or an alternative

75
00:03:17,256 --> 00:03:18,306
with an onscreen remote.

76
00:03:19,066 --> 00:03:20,786
And what's more,

77
00:03:20,786 --> 00:03:22,306
without repairing their switch.

78
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:26,166
Someone using Switch

79
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:28,656
or their Mac can immediately

80
00:03:28,926 --> 00:03:31,496
totally autonomously

81
00:03:32,056 --> 00:03:33,456
We think this is a

82
00:03:33,456 --> 00:03:36,966
And we can't wait for

83
00:03:37,226 --> 00:03:38,426
Next up, Dwell Control.

84
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:40,886
There are a number of

85
00:03:40,886 --> 00:03:43,226
that track someone's focus when

86
00:03:43,586 --> 00:03:45,996
So they may take the form

87
00:03:45,996 --> 00:03:48,696
on a headband, or actually

88
00:03:49,516 --> 00:03:51,816
Dwell Control is a

89
00:03:51,816 --> 00:03:53,586
which integrates

90
00:03:53,836 --> 00:03:55,256
by allowing them to

91
00:03:55,916 --> 00:03:57,926
When the mouse dwells

92
00:03:58,556 --> 00:03:59,956
Dwell Control presents

93
00:03:59,956 --> 00:04:02,826
And when a timer expires,

94
00:03:59,956 --> 00:04:02,826
And when a timer expires,

95
00:04:02,876 --> 00:04:03,886
for instance a mouse click.

96
00:04:04,696 --> 00:04:07,266
This allows someone to control

97
00:04:07,266 --> 00:04:08,376
to manipulate the mouse.

98
00:04:08,626 --> 00:04:11,036
And of course, it's customizable

99
00:04:11,266 --> 00:04:12,156
just like Switch Control.

100
00:04:12,656 --> 00:04:14,176
So next, let's look at vision.

101
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:18,745
So, for many years Mac OS and

102
00:04:18,745 --> 00:04:20,315
like invert colors

103
00:04:21,046 --> 00:04:23,526
to help people increase

104
00:04:23,526 --> 00:04:25,926
on their device, deal

105
00:04:25,926 --> 00:04:27,186
or work around color issues.

106
00:04:27,836 --> 00:04:29,636
This year we're expanding

107
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:32,116
across Mac OS, iOS and tvOS.

108
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:34,706
We've added color

109
00:04:34,706 --> 00:04:37,476
with color blindness, which

110
00:04:37,766 --> 00:04:40,966
like this, appear

111
00:04:41,766 --> 00:04:43,366
And we've also added the ability

112
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:45,366
to tint the entire

113
00:04:45,756 --> 00:04:48,546
which can significantly increase

114
00:04:48,546 --> 00:04:52,776
who find reading black

115
00:04:53,536 --> 00:04:56,026
So in watchOS, someone using

116
00:04:56,026 --> 00:04:58,196
spoken aloud to them

117
00:04:58,196 --> 00:04:59,336
or tapping on the watch face.

118
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,356
But sometimes they may want

119
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,356
But sometimes they may want

120
00:05:02,356 --> 00:05:04,116
without disturbing

121
00:05:04,296 --> 00:05:06,546
So in watchOS 3 we're

122
00:05:07,396 --> 00:05:10,006
Taptic Time is a VoiceOver

123
00:05:10,006 --> 00:05:11,956
of distinct taps from

124
00:05:11,956 --> 00:05:15,096
to help someone tell time

125
00:05:15,686 --> 00:05:20,276
So iOS has a lot of

126
00:05:20,276 --> 00:05:22,596
with visual disabilities

127
00:05:22,596 --> 00:05:23,816
with the content

128
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:25,766
But what about their

129
00:05:26,796 --> 00:05:29,106
In iOS 10 we're introducing

130
00:05:29,786 --> 00:05:31,986
Magnifier is available

131
00:05:32,606 --> 00:05:34,356
And it lets someone use

132
00:05:34,456 --> 00:05:36,496
to magnify objects in

133
00:05:37,206 --> 00:05:39,886
And I'd love to show

134
00:05:44,376 --> 00:05:46,716
Okay, so I'm going to

135
00:05:46,716 --> 00:05:51,626
into Settings, General,

136
00:05:51,626 --> 00:05:52,596
and flipping the switch.

137
00:05:53,766 --> 00:05:55,346
Now I can turn on Magnifier

138
00:05:55,346 --> 00:05:56,726
by just triple clicking

139
00:05:57,366 --> 00:05:59,066
So here we are.

140
00:05:59,836 --> 00:06:02,916
So, if I want to read what's

141
00:05:59,836 --> 00:06:02,916
So, if I want to read what's

142
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:06,846
for instance, I can

143
00:06:06,846 --> 00:06:09,146
I have access to things

144
00:06:09,146 --> 00:06:10,896
for a low light environment.

145
00:06:11,636 --> 00:06:13,766
I can lock focus on a

146
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:17,586
And in case I have trouble

147
00:06:17,976 --> 00:06:19,396
or I'm pointing at

148
00:06:19,396 --> 00:06:23,416
I can take a freeze frame

149
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:24,926
And we captured this image

150
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:27,566
at the device's native camera

151
00:06:27,566 --> 00:06:29,286
out and in, move around.

152
00:06:30,186 --> 00:06:33,336
And Magnifier also supports

153
00:06:33,466 --> 00:06:35,166
to help someone increase

154
00:06:35,626 --> 00:06:38,976
So for instance, maybe

155
00:06:39,396 --> 00:06:42,696
maybe inverted grayscale,

156
00:06:42,906 --> 00:06:44,586
So that's pretty

157
00:06:45,486 --> 00:06:48,176
Okay, so that's an example

158
00:06:49,046 --> 00:06:51,596
Okay, so what's new in hearing?

159
00:06:51,886 --> 00:06:54,696
iOS has supported hardware

160
00:06:55,396 --> 00:06:57,676
TTY technology allows

161
00:06:57,676 --> 00:07:00,956
to hold text conversations

162
00:06:57,676 --> 00:07:00,956
to hold text conversations

163
00:07:01,496 --> 00:07:03,556
Here is what an existing

164
00:07:04,386 --> 00:07:05,956
As you can see, it's

165
00:07:06,016 --> 00:07:07,966
and probably difficult

166
00:07:08,476 --> 00:07:10,646
But it's incredibly important

167
00:07:10,906 --> 00:07:13,906
especially when you factor in

168
00:07:13,906 --> 00:07:17,146
from TTY to voice, allowing

169
00:07:17,146 --> 00:07:20,116
to contact businesses,

170
00:07:20,116 --> 00:07:20,936
who may not be using one.

171
00:07:21,736 --> 00:07:23,476
We thought it would be

172
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:25,216
of this device was

173
00:07:25,476 --> 00:07:26,656
without any additional hardware.

174
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:31,386
So new in iOS 10 anyone can

175
00:07:31,696 --> 00:07:33,236
in a familiar interface

176
00:07:33,236 --> 00:07:34,436
to use any additional hardware.

177
00:07:35,256 --> 00:07:39,156
These calls work with legacy

178
00:07:39,156 --> 00:07:42,286
to dial a non-TTY number through

179
00:07:42,956 --> 00:07:43,896
Plus, it has built

180
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:47,356
in TTY-specific quick type

181
00:07:47,356 --> 00:07:49,206
in with existing

182
00:07:49,756 --> 00:07:50,656
And finally, learning.

183
00:07:51,626 --> 00:07:54,766
Dyslexia is an incredibly common

184
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:56,716
the ability to read

185
00:07:56,716 --> 00:07:57,576
of people around the world.

186
00:07:58,246 --> 00:08:00,276
In iOS 10 we're excited

187
00:07:58,246 --> 00:08:00,276
In iOS 10 we're excited

188
00:08:00,276 --> 00:08:02,476
of enhancements designed to

189
00:08:03,496 --> 00:08:05,606
We've implemented

190
00:08:06,106 --> 00:08:08,656
and Speak Screen to help people

191
00:08:08,656 --> 00:08:09,506
that's already been entered.

192
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:12,216
And we've implemented new

193
00:08:12,286 --> 00:08:13,936
to help people immediately

194
00:08:14,006 --> 00:08:16,136
And I'd love to show

195
00:08:16,426 --> 00:08:19,716
Okay, so I've turned on typing

196
00:08:19,716 --> 00:08:21,016
in Accessibility

197
00:08:21,016 --> 00:08:22,366
So I'll just fire up Notes.

198
00:08:22,656 --> 00:08:24,296
And what I'm going to

199
00:08:24,296 --> 00:08:25,906
to type the word

200
00:08:25,946 --> 00:08:27,496
to pause after typing the O.

201
00:08:28,306 --> 00:08:29,896
And I've turned on

202
00:08:30,316 --> 00:08:33,306
where iOS will read the last

203
00:08:33,306 --> 00:08:35,236
to me after a pause

204
00:08:35,236 --> 00:08:38,476
that I didn't enter a visually

205
00:08:41,426 --> 00:08:41,655
&gt;&gt; E.

206
00:08:42,366 --> 00:08:45,216
&gt;&gt; So, it may be difficult

207
00:08:45,216 --> 00:08:47,666
but iOS just read

208
00:08:47,936 --> 00:08:49,186
So that wasn't correct.

209
00:08:50,426 --> 00:08:50,986
&gt;&gt; O.

210
00:08:50,986 --> 00:08:55,016
&gt;&gt; Great. Now, I'm going

211
00:08:55,056 --> 00:08:58,006
and iOS is going to read

212
00:08:58,006 --> 00:08:59,566
because I've turned

213
00:08:59,566 --> 00:09:01,046
So I can get immediate feedback

214
00:08:59,566 --> 00:09:01,046
So I can get immediate feedback

215
00:09:01,046 --> 00:09:03,476
as to whether the word I've

216
00:09:04,716 --> 00:09:10,096
&gt;&gt; Welcome to our session.

217
00:09:10,556 --> 00:09:12,316
&gt;&gt; Okay. So that's

218
00:09:12,316 --> 00:09:16,996
of enhanced typing

219
00:09:19,406 --> 00:09:21,356
So, hopefully I've whetted

220
00:09:21,356 --> 00:09:23,096
of accommodations

221
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:25,296
to make sure the entire

222
00:09:25,296 --> 00:09:25,766
to everyone.

223
00:09:26,336 --> 00:09:27,516
So if you're new

224
00:09:27,516 --> 00:09:30,166
you may be wondering about

225
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:31,476
accommodations into your apps.

226
00:09:31,966 --> 00:09:34,006
And if you've used the

227
00:09:34,486 --> 00:09:36,316
maybe it's time for a quick

228
00:09:36,316 --> 00:09:37,146
onto some new API.

229
00:09:37,796 --> 00:09:40,246
So, how do we use the

230
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,536
to make sure our

231
00:09:42,956 --> 00:09:45,376
Well, the first step is to

232
00:09:46,246 --> 00:09:48,296
Traditionally, the best way

233
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:50,686
up an assistive app like

234
00:09:50,686 --> 00:09:51,476
and see what happened.

235
00:09:52,326 --> 00:09:54,216
You'll want to check that

236
00:09:54,216 --> 00:09:54,856
are exposed.

237
00:09:56,026 --> 00:09:58,196
That everything that is

238
00:09:58,196 --> 00:10:00,506
so someone using

239
00:09:58,196 --> 00:10:00,506
so someone using

240
00:10:01,756 --> 00:10:03,406
You'll want to check that

241
00:10:03,406 --> 00:10:05,786
with VoiceOver can do everything

242
00:10:06,956 --> 00:10:09,706
And finally, you're designing

243
00:10:09,706 --> 00:10:10,136
for your app.

244
00:10:10,136 --> 00:10:12,286
So you'll want to make sure

245
00:10:12,286 --> 00:10:14,566
with VoiceOver, for

246
00:10:14,606 --> 00:10:16,496
and smooth an experience

247
00:10:17,656 --> 00:10:19,596
So this year we're also excited

248
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:22,266
that there's a brand new

249
00:10:22,266 --> 00:10:24,736
lot of more powerful and

250
00:10:24,736 --> 00:10:25,486
catch mistakes.

251
00:10:26,266 --> 00:10:29,406
If you want to learn more about

252
00:10:29,406 --> 00:10:32,096
to check out the

253
00:10:32,096 --> 00:10:34,706
for Accessibility on Wednesday

254
00:10:34,706 --> 00:10:38,356
For this session we're going to

255
00:10:38,356 --> 00:10:40,636
because it's still the best

256
00:10:40,966 --> 00:10:42,536
with accessibility

257
00:10:43,096 --> 00:10:45,846
Okay, so let's do it.

258
00:10:45,846 --> 00:10:47,216
Let's take a look at a live app

259
00:10:47,246 --> 00:10:48,656
and find its accessibility

260
00:10:49,146 --> 00:10:51,856
So, for this presentation

261
00:10:52,286 --> 00:10:55,636
but the same basic flow

262
00:10:56,176 --> 00:11:01,806
Okay, so the first thing I'm

263
00:10:56,176 --> 00:11:01,806
Okay, so the first thing I'm

264
00:11:01,806 --> 00:11:04,476
to my accessibility

265
00:11:04,476 --> 00:11:05,836
into Accessibility Settings.

266
00:11:06,256 --> 00:11:07,356
And all the way at the bottom,

267
00:11:07,356 --> 00:11:09,916
Accessibility Shortcut,

268
00:11:10,826 --> 00:11:13,296
Okay, so let's fire up

269
00:11:13,296 --> 00:11:16,166
a pro app for selecting

270
00:11:17,256 --> 00:11:18,016
And turn on VoiceOver

271
00:11:18,016 --> 00:11:19,736
by triple-clicking the Home

272
00:11:20,286 --> 00:11:21,206
&gt;&gt; VoiceOver on.

273
00:11:21,626 --> 00:11:22,716
DogRoutePro.

274
00:11:22,946 --> 00:11:23,326
Routes.

275
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:25,816
&gt;&gt; So, there are two, excuse

276
00:11:25,816 --> 00:11:27,736
to navigate your app

277
00:11:28,156 --> 00:11:30,626
You can take one finger

278
00:11:30,626 --> 00:11:31,706
and VoiceOver will select

279
00:11:31,706 --> 00:11:32,926
and read what's underneath

280
00:11:33,506 --> 00:11:36,296
Or you can swipe with one

281
00:11:36,296 --> 00:11:38,556
to move forward or back

282
00:11:38,856 --> 00:11:40,826
So let's see how accessible

283
00:11:41,566 --> 00:11:42,516
&gt;&gt; Avenue Loop.

284
00:11:42,766 --> 00:11:44,126
0.8 miles.

285
00:11:44,126 --> 00:11:46,966
&gt;&gt; So, immediately I

286
00:11:46,966 --> 00:11:49,776
that if you activate this cell,

287
00:11:50,486 --> 00:11:52,416
But nothing conveys that

288
00:11:52,446 --> 00:11:55,956
Let's keep going.

289
00:11:56,146 --> 00:11:56,556
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] button.

290
00:11:56,876 --> 00:12:00,046
&gt;&gt; So this button has a label

291
00:11:56,876 --> 00:12:00,046
&gt;&gt; So this button has a label

292
00:12:00,046 --> 00:12:03,046
of the image I used

293
00:12:03,926 --> 00:12:05,136
That's the framework's

294
00:12:05,136 --> 00:12:06,576
on the only information

295
00:12:06,576 --> 00:12:08,026
So we'll have to give

296
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:09,156
All right.

297
00:12:09,156 --> 00:12:10,216
So let's activate this cell.

298
00:12:10,546 --> 00:12:11,956
To activate an item

299
00:12:12,086 --> 00:12:13,656
when the item is

300
00:12:13,656 --> 00:12:15,336
to double-tap onscreen

301
00:12:16,186 --> 00:12:17,466
&gt;&gt; Avenue Loop.

302
00:12:17,466 --> 00:12:19,536
0 -- Avenue Loop.

303
00:12:19,536 --> 00:12:20,986
Routes. Back button.

304
00:12:20,986 --> 00:12:21,956
&gt;&gt; Okay, let's go

305
00:12:21,956 --> 00:12:23,886
&gt;&gt; Avenue Loop.

306
00:12:23,886 --> 00:12:25,176
Avenue Loop ratings.

307
00:12:25,456 --> 00:12:26,986
Heading. Distractions.

308
00:12:27,526 --> 00:12:29,126
Smells. Greenery.

309
00:12:29,246 --> 00:12:29,666
Friends.

310
00:12:30,196 --> 00:12:31,396
&gt;&gt; So for this ratings graph,

311
00:12:31,396 --> 00:12:33,506
the graph values are

312
00:12:33,506 --> 00:12:34,586
to someone using voiceover.

313
00:12:35,046 --> 00:12:36,526
Let's keep going.

314
00:12:36,526 --> 00:12:37,816
&gt;&gt; Avenue Loop route.

315
00:12:37,816 --> 00:12:39,926
Heading. Broadway and Ridgeway.

316
00:12:40,506 --> 00:12:42,906
Hazard. Boys' Choir on Ridgeway.

317
00:12:43,086 --> 00:12:44,616
41st and Broadway.

318
00:12:45,606 --> 00:12:49,046
&gt;&gt; So, because I gave these

319
00:12:49,256 --> 00:12:52,726
the frameworks were able to use

320
00:12:52,726 --> 00:12:54,076
for the map annotations.

321
00:12:54,606 --> 00:12:55,126
So that's good.

322
00:12:55,126 --> 00:12:57,276
Let's move on to this Steps tab.

323
00:12:57,486 --> 00:12:59,186
&gt;&gt; Steps. Text selected.

324
00:12:59,186 --> 00:13:01,106
Step 41st.

325
00:12:59,186 --> 00:13:01,106
Step 41st.

326
00:13:03,136 --> 00:13:04,716
-- Broadway and Ridgeway.

327
00:13:04,926 --> 00:13:06,826
Turn right at Broadway

328
00:13:07,216 --> 00:13:08,886
Boys' Choir on Ridgeway.

329
00:13:09,066 --> 00:13:12,086
Boys' Choir between Gilbert

330
00:13:12,456 --> 00:13:13,996
Continue along Ridgeway.

331
00:13:14,486 --> 00:13:16,256
Be careful of cars and children.

332
00:13:16,476 --> 00:13:18,576
&gt;&gt; So, VoiceOver was

333
00:13:18,576 --> 00:13:19,576
in these table view cells.

334
00:13:19,816 --> 00:13:22,206
But you'll notice that these

335
00:13:22,206 --> 00:13:24,396
on the route are not

336
00:13:24,796 --> 00:13:28,616
for someone using VoiceOver even

337
00:13:28,616 --> 00:13:31,086
that there are hazards from the

338
00:13:32,106 --> 00:13:33,886
Okay, let's jump

339
00:13:33,886 --> 00:13:35,366
and discuss how we

340
00:13:38,556 --> 00:13:40,286
So, what did we learn

341
00:13:40,906 --> 00:13:42,296
First, those route list cells.

342
00:13:42,556 --> 00:13:45,346
The Favorite button has that

343
00:13:45,346 --> 00:13:46,576
from the name of the

344
00:13:47,116 --> 00:13:49,556
In addition, it isn't clear

345
00:13:49,556 --> 00:13:52,066
that the table cell itself can

346
00:13:52,546 --> 00:13:55,666
Now, for the ratings graph,

347
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:58,956
those graph values were totally

348
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:04,696
And finally, in the route step

349
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:04,696
And finally, in the route step

350
00:14:04,696 --> 00:14:07,326
waypoints that were hazards

351
00:14:07,326 --> 00:14:08,426
from the other steps

352
00:14:09,526 --> 00:14:11,076
So how can we fix

353
00:14:12,976 --> 00:14:14,526
Well, to understand how, we need

354
00:14:14,526 --> 00:14:17,136
to understand how VoiceOver

355
00:14:17,136 --> 00:14:18,296
from our interface and drive it.

356
00:14:19,046 --> 00:14:20,416
VoiceOver interacts with our app

357
00:14:20,536 --> 00:14:22,076
through the UIAccessibility

358
00:14:23,016 --> 00:14:25,466
So let's take, as an

359
00:14:25,466 --> 00:14:28,846
in the app we just saw.

360
00:14:28,846 --> 00:14:30,596
Assistive apps like

361
00:14:30,596 --> 00:14:33,356
to ask your app's user

362
00:14:33,626 --> 00:14:36,156
So for instance, when Voiceover

363
00:14:36,156 --> 00:14:38,666
that button, VoiceOver

364
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:39,716
what kind of thing are you?"

365
00:14:39,716 --> 00:14:41,906
And the button says,

366
00:14:43,006 --> 00:14:44,546
VoiceOver then asks,

367
00:14:44,546 --> 00:14:45,186
What's your name?"

368
00:14:45,566 --> 00:14:49,006
That button should respond

369
00:14:49,976 --> 00:14:52,536
Finally VoiceOver asks,

370
00:14:52,906 --> 00:14:55,036
And the button replies with

371
00:14:55,746 --> 00:14:57,886
This is the information

372
00:14:58,156 --> 00:15:00,826
"Favorite, Button" and draw

373
00:14:58,156 --> 00:15:00,826
"Favorite, Button" and draw

374
00:15:02,036 --> 00:15:04,326
So these messages from

375
00:15:04,326 --> 00:15:06,596
to your app take the form

376
00:15:06,996 --> 00:15:09,376
The methods are all part of

377
00:15:09,956 --> 00:15:10,866
By implementing the methods

378
00:15:10,866 --> 00:15:12,846
of this protocol you

379
00:15:12,846 --> 00:15:13,896
hierarchies accessible.

380
00:15:14,376 --> 00:15:17,766
So standard UI controls

381
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:20,106
But depending on how you

382
00:15:20,106 --> 00:15:21,836
to set or override

383
00:15:22,256 --> 00:15:23,076
So what properties?

384
00:15:23,346 --> 00:15:23,846
Let's take a look.

385
00:15:24,866 --> 00:15:27,966
Now, there are a lot of methods

386
00:15:27,966 --> 00:15:29,916
that you can use for

387
00:15:30,176 --> 00:15:32,226
over how your interface

388
00:15:32,226 --> 00:15:32,916
to accessibility.

389
00:15:33,326 --> 00:15:34,346
But for most work you need

390
00:15:34,346 --> 00:15:35,906
to only concern yourself

391
00:15:36,566 --> 00:15:38,826
Let's go through the basic

392
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:41,166
First, there's

393
00:15:42,296 --> 00:15:45,006
This property determines if

394
00:15:45,156 --> 00:15:46,456
by an assistive technology

395
00:15:47,066 --> 00:15:49,126
So for instance, if you have

396
00:15:49,126 --> 00:15:51,746
decoration, you can

397
00:15:52,316 --> 00:15:54,916
However, if it represents a

398
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:57,356
to your service, you'll

399
00:15:57,356 --> 00:15:59,446
so someone using VoiceOver

400
00:15:59,686 --> 00:16:01,486
focus on it and learn about it.

401
00:15:59,686 --> 00:16:01,486
focus on it and learn about it.

402
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:06,226
So now your interface element

403
00:16:06,226 --> 00:16:08,856
You'll want to give it a name

404
00:16:09,016 --> 00:16:10,696
That's what the accessibility

405
00:16:11,466 --> 00:16:13,616
The label is a concise

406
00:16:13,966 --> 00:16:16,326
For instance Send

407
00:16:16,966 --> 00:16:21,496
So how does someone know that

408
00:16:22,246 --> 00:16:25,306
New Alarm doesn't convey

409
00:16:25,306 --> 00:16:27,326
in the same way that its

410
00:16:27,976 --> 00:16:29,556
That's where the

411
00:16:30,396 --> 00:16:31,776
Accessibility traits declare

412
00:16:31,776 --> 00:16:34,386
to the assistive technology

413
00:16:34,386 --> 00:16:35,516
and how to interact with it.

414
00:16:35,906 --> 00:16:37,656
So for instance, a button

415
00:16:37,656 --> 00:16:39,016
UIAccessibilityTraitButton.

416
00:16:40,016 --> 00:16:41,336
An adjustable control

417
00:16:41,336 --> 00:16:43,166
like a slider would

418
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:44,686
UIAccessibilityTraitAdjustable.

419
00:16:45,346 --> 00:16:46,506
The traits are a bit masked,

420
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:47,946
so an element could

421
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:50,276
For instance, a selected

422
00:16:50,566 --> 00:16:54,156
UIAccessibilityTraitButton and

423
00:16:54,566 --> 00:16:57,216
The Button trait is what

424
00:16:57,636 --> 00:16:59,336
so someone knows they can

425
00:16:59,776 --> 00:17:03,386
Next there's the

426
00:16:59,776 --> 00:17:03,386
Next there's the

427
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:06,366
This determines where

428
00:17:06,366 --> 00:17:07,866
and is used both for hit testing

429
00:17:07,906 --> 00:17:09,756
and for drawing a cursor

430
00:17:10,445 --> 00:17:13,886
Now, for UI views you usually do

431
00:17:14,106 --> 00:17:17,046
because it's computed for you

432
00:17:17,046 --> 00:17:17,806
in the view hierarchy.

433
00:17:18,925 --> 00:17:20,455
But you can modify it if needed.

434
00:17:20,455 --> 00:17:22,695
Just remember that it is

435
00:17:23,205 --> 00:17:26,496
And finally, there's

436
00:17:27,316 --> 00:17:29,036
This is useful for

437
00:17:29,036 --> 00:17:30,986
of conceptual value

438
00:17:31,576 --> 00:17:34,366
So for instance, a slider

439
00:17:34,366 --> 00:17:35,946
in percent through the

440
00:17:36,606 --> 00:17:38,486
An on-off switch

441
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:40,336
And if you had some

442
00:17:40,336 --> 00:17:41,966
that controlled the

443
00:17:41,966 --> 00:17:45,886
of an instrument, you'd want to

444
00:17:45,886 --> 00:17:47,016
through the accessibility value.

445
00:17:47,596 --> 00:17:52,016
Okay, so what do you do

446
00:17:52,616 --> 00:17:55,406
where each logical piece of your

447
00:17:55,406 --> 00:17:56,086
to a UI view?

448
00:17:57,256 --> 00:17:59,776
When you need to do that,

449
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:04,086
UIAccessibilityElement objects

450
00:18:04,086 --> 00:18:04,946
regions onscreen.

451
00:18:05,276 --> 00:18:08,006
And they interact with the

452
00:18:08,006 --> 00:18:09,106
like your views do.

453
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:12,396
You can use them, for instance,

454
00:18:12,396 --> 00:18:14,716
of a control that's built

455
00:18:15,496 --> 00:18:19,856
So to do so, make the element

456
00:18:19,856 --> 00:18:21,246
into an accessibility container

457
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:24,736
by setting its accessibility

458
00:18:24,736 --> 00:18:26,496
of UIAccessibilityElement

459
00:18:26,556 --> 00:18:29,226
that represent each

460
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:34,386
So, UIAccessibilityElement

461
00:18:34,386 --> 00:18:37,386
that graph we saw earlier where

462
00:18:37,766 --> 00:18:39,786
to present the graph bars.

463
00:18:40,306 --> 00:18:42,316
But if you're a very astute

464
00:18:42,316 --> 00:18:42,916
slight snag.

465
00:18:45,456 --> 00:18:47,916
UIAccessibilityElement

466
00:18:48,006 --> 00:18:49,986
so we need to set their

467
00:18:50,516 --> 00:18:53,876
However, those graph bars

468
00:18:54,136 --> 00:18:56,316
so their frames and

469
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,386
Now, to rectify this

470
00:18:59,386 --> 00:19:01,746
or we could set accessibility

471
00:18:59,386 --> 00:19:01,746
or we could set accessibility

472
00:19:02,326 --> 00:19:05,806
Or, in iOS 10 we can

473
00:19:05,806 --> 00:19:06,806
in container space.

474
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:10,676
When you set this property to

475
00:19:11,576 --> 00:19:14,816
UIAccessibilityElement will

476
00:19:14,816 --> 00:19:16,236
container's position onscreen.

477
00:19:16,806 --> 00:19:20,446
So those are the

478
00:19:20,446 --> 00:19:22,016
in the UIAccessibility

479
00:19:22,016 --> 00:19:23,216
with UIAccessibilityElement.

480
00:19:23,216 --> 00:19:25,196
And you'll get most of the

481
00:19:25,576 --> 00:19:26,536
So what are the takeaways?

482
00:19:27,096 --> 00:19:28,806
First, know that the methods

483
00:19:28,806 --> 00:19:31,646
in UIAccessibility protocol are

484
00:19:31,646 --> 00:19:32,606
items to accessibility.

485
00:19:33,156 --> 00:19:35,456
Through the methods of this

486
00:19:35,456 --> 00:19:37,796
questions about what

487
00:19:37,796 --> 00:19:40,096
and what they can do.

488
00:19:40,336 --> 00:19:42,226
Now, for many classes

489
00:19:42,226 --> 00:19:44,146
so there's nothing

490
00:19:44,226 --> 00:19:46,436
But you may need to set

491
00:19:46,436 --> 00:19:48,166
to get the behavior you need.

492
00:19:48,916 --> 00:19:50,856
Finally, if you have

493
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,216
that don't map directly

494
00:19:52,486 --> 00:19:54,176
use UIAccessibilityElement.

495
00:19:54,836 --> 00:19:56,996
So, let's go in and use

496
00:19:56,996 --> 00:19:58,016
to make our app accessible.

497
00:19:58,726 --> 00:20:01,486
The first thing we're

498
00:19:58,726 --> 00:20:01,486
The first thing we're

499
00:20:01,486 --> 00:20:05,106
to fix the fact that that

500
00:20:05,106 --> 00:20:07,756
that it was able to be

501
00:20:08,466 --> 00:20:11,386
So, the way we're going to do

502
00:20:11,576 --> 00:20:13,236
all we're going to do is "Or"

503
00:20:13,236 --> 00:20:15,546
in the trait

504
00:20:16,516 --> 00:20:19,656
Done. All right, now

505
00:20:19,656 --> 00:20:20,676
for that Favorite button.

506
00:20:21,226 --> 00:20:25,616
What we're going to do here

507
00:20:25,616 --> 00:20:28,426
for this cell we're going

508
00:20:28,426 --> 00:20:32,796
and set its accessibility

509
00:20:32,796 --> 00:20:33,886
and then the name of the route.

510
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:35,526
I'm putting the name

511
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:38,466
so it's unambiguous which

512
00:20:38,466 --> 00:20:39,516
if I activate that button.

513
00:20:40,486 --> 00:20:45,166
All right, let's move

514
00:20:45,406 --> 00:20:49,216
So, like I said, I'm doing

515
00:20:49,846 --> 00:20:51,516
So we're going to use

516
00:20:52,316 --> 00:20:54,906
Now, what I want to do

517
00:20:54,906 --> 00:20:56,466
to add some ivars to keep track

518
00:20:56,466 --> 00:20:58,236
of the UIAccessibilityElement

519
00:20:59,016 --> 00:21:01,636
So, just four ivars, one

520
00:20:59,016 --> 00:21:01,636
So, just four ivars, one

521
00:21:02,106 --> 00:21:03,556
that are

522
00:21:04,926 --> 00:21:07,326
Next I'll add a short

523
00:21:07,326 --> 00:21:09,226
to help me translate

524
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:10,586
into a user-friendly string.

525
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:12,706
So, rated X of 5.

526
00:21:13,896 --> 00:21:17,796
And then, for each of

527
00:21:17,796 --> 00:21:20,116
for these rating

528
00:21:20,116 --> 00:21:21,846
to set the accessibility value

529
00:21:21,846 --> 00:21:26,406
of the appropriate accessibility

530
00:21:26,406 --> 00:21:27,286
that describes the rating.

531
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:30,806
So, for smells -- oops.

532
00:21:31,516 --> 00:21:33,246
Put distractions first.

533
00:21:34,396 --> 00:21:37,526
Smells. Greenery.

534
00:21:38,136 --> 00:21:40,076
And friends.

535
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:43,076
So again, just grabbing

536
00:21:43,456 --> 00:21:44,776
setting its accessibility value

537
00:21:44,776 --> 00:21:46,916
to be the value string

538
00:21:48,076 --> 00:21:50,046
Okay, now we need to

539
00:21:50,046 --> 00:21:51,566
to be valid accessibility

540
00:21:52,816 --> 00:21:58,196
So in AwakeFromNib here, for

541
00:21:58,336 --> 00:22:00,816
to set it equal to a

542
00:21:58,336 --> 00:22:00,816
to set it equal to a

543
00:22:01,426 --> 00:22:03,466
with our self as the

544
00:22:03,516 --> 00:22:06,516
Now, we're going to set the

545
00:22:06,516 --> 00:22:10,916
to just be the text from the

546
00:22:10,916 --> 00:22:14,246
the UI label, I should

547
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:17,466
And then finally, we'll set

548
00:22:17,466 --> 00:22:19,366
of our self, because we want to

549
00:22:19,716 --> 00:22:21,166
to just be those four elements.

550
00:22:21,886 --> 00:22:25,036
So now we have valid

551
00:22:25,156 --> 00:22:27,476
with a valid label,

552
00:22:27,476 --> 00:22:29,076
and a good accessibility value.

553
00:22:29,636 --> 00:22:30,826
Now we just need

554
00:22:31,916 --> 00:22:33,586
So what we're going to

555
00:22:33,586 --> 00:22:40,456
out the graph bars, we'll

556
00:22:40,456 --> 00:22:43,176
accessibility element and

557
00:22:43,176 --> 00:22:44,016
in container space.

558
00:22:45,146 --> 00:22:49,076
Okay. Then the last thing we

559
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:53,526
of the cells in the

560
00:22:53,716 --> 00:22:56,216
So, I'll go to the

561
00:22:57,516 --> 00:22:59,416
And when we set the

562
00:22:59,596 --> 00:23:01,886
that that cell represents,

563
00:22:59,596 --> 00:23:01,886
that that cell represents,

564
00:23:01,886 --> 00:23:03,066
to do is add some code

565
00:23:03,406 --> 00:23:04,986
to manually set the

566
00:23:04,986 --> 00:23:07,846
to be the waypoint's name and

567
00:23:08,376 --> 00:23:10,366
And then if it's a

568
00:23:11,106 --> 00:23:13,056
And then the hazard description.

569
00:23:14,186 --> 00:23:16,826
Okay, so before we build

570
00:23:16,826 --> 00:23:18,876
to the slides and think about

571
00:23:19,086 --> 00:23:20,406
that a sighted user

572
00:23:20,406 --> 00:23:22,166
that a VoiceOver user still

573
00:23:28,196 --> 00:23:28,826
All right.

574
00:23:28,826 --> 00:23:33,646
So again, first, that route map.

575
00:23:33,786 --> 00:23:36,806
VoiceOver users can discover

576
00:23:36,946 --> 00:23:40,246
the route order is lost because

577
00:23:40,246 --> 00:23:43,266
elements in a spatial,

578
00:23:43,796 --> 00:23:46,916
In addition, someone who's

579
00:23:46,916 --> 00:23:50,006
hazards on that graph by

580
00:23:50,496 --> 00:23:53,456
But someone using VoiceOver will

581
00:23:53,456 --> 00:23:55,566
of the waypoints on the graph

582
00:23:57,616 --> 00:24:00,326
Now, for the route step list,

583
00:23:57,616 --> 00:24:00,326
Now, for the route step list,

584
00:24:00,666 --> 00:24:03,206
in that it's easily

585
00:24:03,206 --> 00:24:05,656
who can scroll through quickly

586
00:24:05,656 --> 00:24:07,766
with the distinctive red

587
00:24:08,346 --> 00:24:11,606
But for a VoiceOver user,

588
00:24:11,606 --> 00:24:13,616
They have to go through

589
00:24:14,056 --> 00:24:15,486
So how can we fix these issues?

590
00:24:16,016 --> 00:24:18,646
We're going to use the rotor.

591
00:24:19,176 --> 00:24:21,836
The rotor is a VoiceOver feature

592
00:24:21,906 --> 00:24:24,536
across an interface by searching

593
00:24:24,836 --> 00:24:26,726
So one of the built-in

594
00:24:26,726 --> 00:24:28,766
is the Headings rotor,

595
00:24:28,766 --> 00:24:31,746
to navigate an interface by

596
00:24:32,106 --> 00:24:35,846
To use the rotor you take two

597
00:24:35,906 --> 00:24:37,846
as though you're

598
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:41,436
Do that to select the rotor

599
00:24:41,476 --> 00:24:44,466
up or down with one

600
00:24:44,466 --> 00:24:45,506
or next with that rotor.

601
00:24:46,486 --> 00:24:49,636
So this year we're

602
00:24:49,636 --> 00:24:51,276
to add your own custom

603
00:24:51,976 --> 00:24:53,206
We hope you'll take

604
00:24:53,206 --> 00:24:55,796
to add a totally new

605
00:24:56,176 --> 00:24:57,576
when people are using

606
00:24:58,376 --> 00:25:00,656
On iOS, to add your

607
00:24:58,376 --> 00:25:00,656
On iOS, to add your

608
00:25:00,656 --> 00:25:03,936
set the Accessibility Custom

609
00:25:03,936 --> 00:25:06,626
that contains the elements

610
00:25:06,626 --> 00:25:08,946
to search, or that super

611
00:25:09,676 --> 00:25:11,756
You'll want to set

612
00:25:11,756 --> 00:25:13,746
of view accessibility

613
00:25:14,096 --> 00:25:15,526
which are initialized

614
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:19,536
and also an item search block

615
00:25:19,536 --> 00:25:22,066
swipes up or down to

616
00:25:22,066 --> 00:25:24,176
or next match to for that rotor.

617
00:25:27,586 --> 00:25:28,116
All right.

618
00:25:28,116 --> 00:25:29,456
Let's switch back over

619
00:25:29,456 --> 00:25:30,706
and see this new API in action.

620
00:25:37,176 --> 00:25:40,806
Okay. So, let's first

621
00:25:40,806 --> 00:25:42,586
to the Route Step

622
00:25:42,806 --> 00:25:45,556
so someone can easily navigate

623
00:25:45,976 --> 00:25:47,016
that represent hazards.

624
00:25:47,046 --> 00:25:54,756
So, I'm going to open up the

625
00:25:54,756 --> 00:25:57,816
And I'm going to set this

626
00:25:59,116 --> 00:26:00,466
So basic skeleton here.

627
00:25:59,116 --> 00:26:00,466
So basic skeleton here.

628
00:26:00,466 --> 00:26:03,406
I'm going to make a Hazards

629
00:26:03,406 --> 00:26:05,756
rotor object with the name

630
00:26:05,756 --> 00:26:08,596
And I'm going to set the

631
00:26:08,596 --> 00:26:10,286
property to be just that rotor.

632
00:26:11,376 --> 00:26:15,286
And inside of the callback here,

633
00:26:15,286 --> 00:26:17,306
to get our reference

634
00:26:17,306 --> 00:26:18,236
an array of waypoints,

635
00:26:18,486 --> 00:26:20,586
and determine whether we're

636
00:26:20,586 --> 00:26:23,656
by inspecting the

637
00:26:24,246 --> 00:26:26,326
Next, we're going to find where

638
00:26:27,046 --> 00:26:29,986
So, by default, if

639
00:26:29,986 --> 00:26:31,096
in the table view right now,

640
00:26:31,486 --> 00:26:33,786
we're going to start

641
00:26:33,816 --> 00:26:34,976
or after the last item,

642
00:26:35,196 --> 00:26:37,426
depending on whether we're

643
00:26:37,616 --> 00:26:40,086
So we go into the list of cells.

644
00:26:40,816 --> 00:26:42,916
Otherwise, if we

645
00:26:44,126 --> 00:26:45,706
we're going to get it as a cell.

646
00:26:45,706 --> 00:26:48,916
And then start at the

647
00:26:48,956 --> 00:26:50,186
that item in our data model.

648
00:26:50,756 --> 00:26:53,116
Okay. Then we're going to search

649
00:26:53,116 --> 00:26:58,206
through our data model

650
00:26:58,836 --> 00:27:02,106
And we're going to search

651
00:26:58,836 --> 00:27:02,106
And we're going to search

652
00:27:02,836 --> 00:27:06,196
And a match is just a

653
00:27:06,836 --> 00:27:10,886
So if we find a result, we're

654
00:27:10,886 --> 00:27:15,576
for that result, scroll to

655
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:17,916
grab the cell that we

656
00:27:17,916 --> 00:27:20,926
onscreen and return a

657
00:27:20,926 --> 00:27:23,676
item result with the

658
00:27:23,676 --> 00:27:27,066
Now, it also supports

659
00:27:27,196 --> 00:27:28,406
in the initializer.

660
00:27:29,176 --> 00:27:32,696
If we conform to UI text input,

661
00:27:32,696 --> 00:27:34,526
through different

662
00:27:34,836 --> 00:27:36,036
However, we're not doing that,

663
00:27:36,036 --> 00:27:37,466
so we're just going

664
00:27:39,196 --> 00:27:42,386
And if our While Loop terminates

665
00:27:42,386 --> 00:27:44,866
we'll return nil to say we

666
00:27:45,326 --> 00:27:48,256
Let's do a similar thing

667
00:27:51,216 --> 00:27:54,076
Sorry, we have this

668
00:27:54,076 --> 00:27:56,476
which searches our

669
00:27:56,476 --> 00:27:59,736
from one annotation view

670
00:28:01,136 --> 00:28:03,736
with a given predicate

671
00:28:03,736 --> 00:28:07,256
to whether we should return

672
00:28:07,256 --> 00:28:09,596
on what data model

673
00:28:09,596 --> 00:28:14,086
So we're going to use this

674
00:28:14,426 --> 00:28:15,946
We're going to override

675
00:28:16,456 --> 00:28:19,326
We're going to make a

676
00:28:19,326 --> 00:28:21,306
to help us make multiple rotors,

677
00:28:21,306 --> 00:28:24,026
because we're basically

678
00:28:24,216 --> 00:28:26,106
for the various rotors

679
00:28:26,106 --> 00:28:27,956
And then we're going to use this

680
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:29,916
when setting our accessibility

681
00:28:30,566 --> 00:28:31,966
We're going to have

682
00:28:32,526 --> 00:28:34,286
that just returns

683
00:28:34,936 --> 00:28:39,106
And a Hazards rotor that

684
00:28:39,636 --> 00:28:42,116
Okay, so in this fact array,

685
00:28:42,116 --> 00:28:45,586
Well, we need to create a

686
00:28:45,586 --> 00:28:48,006
object with the appropriate

687
00:28:48,556 --> 00:28:52,006
We're going to use our Search

688
00:28:52,936 --> 00:28:55,306
Pass it the current element.

689
00:28:55,946 --> 00:28:57,676
Whether we're going

690
00:28:57,676 --> 00:28:59,106
And what the predicate was.

691
00:28:59,636 --> 00:29:04,386
And again, if we were able to

692
00:28:59,636 --> 00:29:04,386
And again, if we were able to

693
00:29:04,386 --> 00:29:07,186
to wrap it up in a customer

694
00:29:07,916 --> 00:29:09,976
Otherwise we'll return

695
00:29:09,976 --> 00:29:12,756
to find a previous or

696
00:29:13,766 --> 00:29:14,336
All right.

697
00:29:14,336 --> 00:29:16,556
Let's build and run this.

698
00:29:16,556 --> 00:29:17,156
&gt;&gt; Avenue --

699
00:29:17,156 --> 00:29:17,826
&gt;&gt; There we go.

700
00:29:18,016 --> 00:29:18,496
&gt;&gt; Heading.

701
00:29:18,916 --> 00:29:19,236
&gt;&gt; All right.

702
00:29:19,236 --> 00:29:22,056
So let's look at

703
00:29:22,096 --> 00:29:22,966
&gt;&gt; Avenue Loop.

704
00:29:23,216 --> 00:29:24,566
0.8 miles.

705
00:29:24,566 --> 00:29:25,486
Button.

706
00:29:25,746 --> 00:29:27,236
&gt;&gt; Okay. So VoiceOver

707
00:29:27,236 --> 00:29:27,736
That's great.

708
00:29:27,826 --> 00:29:29,756
Someone can know that they

709
00:29:29,756 --> 00:29:31,196
Let's take a look at

710
00:29:31,816 --> 00:29:33,166
&gt;&gt; Favorite, Avenue Loop.

711
00:29:33,376 --> 00:29:33,876
Button.

712
00:29:34,136 --> 00:29:34,636
&gt;&gt; Great.

713
00:29:35,236 --> 00:29:36,026
&gt;&gt; Selected.

714
00:29:36,526 --> 00:29:37,926
Favorite Avenue Loop.

715
00:29:38,326 --> 00:29:40,376
&gt;&gt; So the selected

716
00:29:40,376 --> 00:29:41,636
of for us by the frameworks.

717
00:29:41,636 --> 00:29:43,146
So I'd like to activate

718
00:29:43,146 --> 00:29:44,396
&gt;&gt; Avenue Loop.

719
00:29:45,216 --> 00:29:46,706
Avenue Loop.

720
00:29:46,706 --> 00:29:48,126
Avenue Loop distractions.

721
00:29:48,596 --> 00:29:50,156
Rated 3 of 5.

722
00:29:50,296 --> 00:29:52,516
Smells. Rated 2 of 5.

723
00:29:52,616 --> 00:29:54,996
Greenery. Rated 5 of 5.

724
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:57,386
Friends. Rated 4 of 5.

725
00:29:57,386 --> 00:29:57,776
&gt;&gt; Excellent.

726
00:29:57,816 --> 00:29:59,476
So our graph bars

727
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:01,426
&gt;&gt; Avenue Loop route.

728
00:30:01,516 --> 00:30:02,946
Broadway and Ridgeway.

729
00:30:03,506 --> 00:30:05,316
&gt;&gt; Okay. Now let's try

730
00:30:05,806 --> 00:30:06,286
&gt;&gt; Headings.

731
00:30:06,526 --> 00:30:07,476
Words. Characters.

732
00:30:07,476 --> 00:30:10,146
Hazards. Route steps.

733
00:30:10,146 --> 00:30:11,796
Hazard. Hazard.

734
00:30:11,796 --> 00:30:12,866
Ridgeway and Piedmont.

735
00:30:13,006 --> 00:30:14,366
Piedmont and 41st.

736
00:30:14,546 --> 00:30:15,886
41st and Broadway.

737
00:30:15,886 --> 00:30:17,496
&gt;&gt; Great. So our Route

738
00:30:17,496 --> 00:30:19,126
&gt;&gt; Use the rotor to access --

739
00:30:19,126 --> 00:30:21,026
&gt;&gt; Excuse me.

740
00:30:21,256 --> 00:30:21,746
&gt;&gt; Hazards.

741
00:30:23,146 --> 00:30:25,386
Hazard. Ridgeway and Piedmont.

742
00:30:25,506 --> 00:30:27,566
Hazard. Boys' Choir on Ridgeway.

743
00:30:27,566 --> 00:30:30,876
&gt;&gt; And the Hazards rotor

744
00:30:30,876 --> 00:30:33,326
and through the list of

745
00:30:33,496 --> 00:30:36,196
So, let's check out

746
00:30:36,196 --> 00:30:38,026
&gt;&gt; Steps. Selected.

747
00:30:38,306 --> 00:30:40,826
Steps. 41st and Broadway.

748
00:30:40,826 --> 00:30:41,516
Start at --

749
00:30:41,516 --> 00:30:42,766
&gt;&gt; That was me.

750
00:30:42,766 --> 00:30:43,526
&gt;&gt; Hazards.

751
00:30:44,356 --> 00:30:46,026
Boys' Choir on Ridgeway.

752
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:50,016
Boys' Choir on Ridgeway.

753
00:30:50,276 --> 00:30:53,296
Boys' Choir between Gilbert

754
00:30:53,656 --> 00:30:55,016
Continue along Ridgeway.

755
00:30:55,906 --> 00:30:57,536
Hazard. Be care --

756
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:57,866
&gt;&gt; Oh, sorry.

757
00:30:57,966 --> 00:30:59,436
The switch was cut off there.

758
00:30:59,936 --> 00:31:01,786
So you heard, though,

759
00:30:59,936 --> 00:31:01,786
So you heard, though,

760
00:31:01,786 --> 00:31:04,196
So our modification to the

761
00:31:04,436 --> 00:31:07,086
It's now conveyed that these

762
00:31:07,476 --> 00:31:09,276
And in addition, we were

763
00:31:09,276 --> 00:31:10,786
to them using the Hazards rotor.

764
00:31:11,876 --> 00:31:12,246
All right.

765
00:31:12,246 --> 00:31:13,216
Let's jump back to the slides.

766
00:31:18,276 --> 00:31:19,716
So, a quick word on tvOS.

767
00:31:20,436 --> 00:31:23,636
tvOS apps are built with UIKit,

768
00:31:23,636 --> 00:31:25,886
about earlier applies

769
00:31:26,416 --> 00:31:28,766
But there are a few

770
00:31:28,766 --> 00:31:31,876
in mind when building your

771
00:31:31,876 --> 00:31:34,796
from the fact that tvOS has

772
00:31:35,966 --> 00:31:40,096
So a common pattern on

773
00:31:40,636 --> 00:31:43,716
to group content onscreen

774
00:31:43,716 --> 00:31:44,656
from the other content.

775
00:31:45,626 --> 00:31:47,166
You can give a similar

776
00:31:47,166 --> 00:31:49,806
to someone using your app

777
00:31:49,806 --> 00:31:51,676
of the Accessibility

778
00:31:53,106 --> 00:31:56,126
Set this property on

779
00:31:56,376 --> 00:31:58,866
their super views or on

780
00:31:59,856 --> 00:32:02,876
to be the headers that are

781
00:31:59,856 --> 00:32:02,876
to be the headers that are

782
00:32:03,766 --> 00:32:06,176
Then when someone

783
00:32:06,556 --> 00:32:08,626
VoiceOver will read

784
00:32:08,706 --> 00:32:12,446
in a distinctive pitch to give

785
00:32:12,446 --> 00:32:13,746
of place in your content.

786
00:32:14,366 --> 00:32:22,906
So I recorded a short video

787
00:32:22,906 --> 00:32:26,516
And when I play it,

788
00:32:26,516 --> 00:32:29,246
down into the collection view of

789
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:32,696
You're going to hear

790
00:32:32,696 --> 00:32:33,896
in a distinctive pitch.

791
00:32:34,766 --> 00:32:37,626
And that's because

792
00:32:37,626 --> 00:32:40,836
to be the Accessibility Header

793
00:32:41,436 --> 00:32:42,736
Now, you'll also

794
00:32:43,166 --> 00:32:47,766
When I pause, VoiceOver will

795
00:32:47,766 --> 00:32:50,546
of the non-focusable

796
00:32:51,026 --> 00:32:53,186
So let's hear that now.

797
00:32:53,316 --> 00:32:54,386
&gt;&gt; Available works.

798
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:56,076
Grain. Button.

799
00:32:57,346 --> 00:32:58,756
Title. Grain.

800
00:32:59,016 --> 00:33:01,086
Author. Vivian Li.

801
00:32:59,016 --> 00:33:01,086
Author. Vivian Li.

802
00:33:01,086 --> 00:33:01,776
Description.

803
00:33:02,176 --> 00:33:03,966
Close up of a strand of grain.

804
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:06,216
It glistens with morning dew.

805
00:33:06,686 --> 00:33:07,646
&gt;&gt; So, the reason I showed you

806
00:33:07,646 --> 00:33:11,286
that secondary Read All behavior

807
00:33:11,286 --> 00:33:14,546
of the information your app

808
00:33:14,546 --> 00:33:15,876
through an accessibility

809
00:33:16,256 --> 00:33:18,346
even if it's not

810
00:33:18,526 --> 00:33:19,996
by the tvOS focus engine.

811
00:33:20,516 --> 00:33:25,026
When you do that, when you

812
00:33:25,326 --> 00:33:27,446
VoiceOver will then read all

813
00:33:27,446 --> 00:33:29,486
of the non-focusable

814
00:33:29,736 --> 00:33:31,036
so that information

815
00:33:31,036 --> 00:33:32,976
to someone using the

816
00:33:33,416 --> 00:33:36,286
Okay. Let's wrap up.

817
00:33:36,816 --> 00:33:39,236
So, when you're out there

818
00:33:39,496 --> 00:33:40,796
with an eye to accessibility,

819
00:33:40,796 --> 00:33:41,886
keep in mind what

820
00:33:43,216 --> 00:33:45,136
First, accessibility

821
00:33:45,736 --> 00:33:48,466
It's about making the great

822
00:33:48,466 --> 00:33:50,456
available to as many

823
00:33:50,716 --> 00:33:54,236
You'll want to design

824
00:33:54,236 --> 00:33:55,226
in mind from the start.

825
00:33:55,776 --> 00:33:58,346
Is anything difficult to use

826
00:33:58,346 --> 00:33:59,256
with a motor disability?

827
00:33:59,756 --> 00:34:01,366
Is anything too low contrast?

828
00:33:59,756 --> 00:34:01,366
Is anything too low contrast?

829
00:34:01,966 --> 00:34:04,186
Excuse me.

830
00:34:04,436 --> 00:34:07,476
UIKit helps your apps become

831
00:34:07,476 --> 00:34:08,956
of the accessibility APIs.

832
00:34:10,076 --> 00:34:13,436
And finally, accessible apps are

833
00:34:13,606 --> 00:34:14,906
So thanks so much for being here

834
00:34:14,906 --> 00:34:15,906
and learning about

835
00:34:17,106 --> 00:34:19,886
So for more information you can

836
00:34:19,916 --> 00:34:21,235
It's Session Number 202.

837
00:34:21,606 --> 00:34:24,896
And there are some

838
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:25,806
that you should check out.

839
00:34:25,806 --> 00:34:29,005
At 10:00 a.m. in this very

840
00:34:29,005 --> 00:34:30,376
on Inclusive App Design.

841
00:34:30,376 --> 00:34:31,565
So make sure you stick around.

842
00:34:33,286 --> 00:34:35,795
And on Wednesday at 10:00 a.m.

843
00:34:35,795 --> 00:34:37,806
in Nob Hill there's the

844
00:34:37,806 --> 00:34:40,166
for Accessibility, which again

845
00:34:40,166 --> 00:34:42,396
about that new accessibility

846
00:34:42,815 --> 00:34:44,306
which I definitely

847
00:34:44,656 --> 00:34:46,306
So that's all I have for today.

848
00:34:46,485 --> 00:34:48,025
Thanks so much and have

849
00:34:49,516 --> 00:34:59,170
