3
00:00:26,236 --> 00:00:26,646
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

4
00:00:26,646 --> 00:00:29,116
Good morning everyone.

5
00:00:30,416 --> 00:00:33,386
My name is Antonio Cavedoni,

6
00:00:33,386 --> 00:00:34,936
about typography and fonts.

7
00:00:34,936 --> 00:00:37,506
I am a type designer at Apple.

8
00:00:38,036 --> 00:00:41,446
So, on the agenda today we

9
00:00:41,446 --> 00:00:43,086
and update our system fonts.

10
00:00:43,856 --> 00:00:45,926
We will see some

11
00:00:47,026 --> 00:00:48,816
We will look at some

12
00:00:49,626 --> 00:00:52,066
And then tools that you have

13
00:00:53,276 --> 00:00:55,226
Lastly, we will see some

14
00:00:55,226 --> 00:00:59,296
to adopt while working

15
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:04,196
Okay. So, San Francisco, it

16
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:04,196
Okay. So, San Francisco, it

17
00:01:04,766 --> 00:01:06,016
We introduced them last year.

18
00:01:06,896 --> 00:01:09,126
This is SF you see right here.

19
00:01:09,526 --> 00:01:14,656
And it is the system font

20
00:01:14,656 --> 00:01:17,666
We introduced this family

21
00:01:17,996 --> 00:01:20,296
There is a video that

22
00:01:20,296 --> 00:01:24,836
and application of SF.

23
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:27,146
And we've been applying

24
00:01:27,666 --> 00:01:32,246
So, Apple TV, we've been

25
00:01:32,526 --> 00:01:36,346
But we've also been applying

26
00:01:36,816 --> 00:01:39,626
Now, in case you haven't

27
00:01:39,626 --> 00:01:42,096
in Moscone Center, there

28
00:01:42,296 --> 00:01:45,466
of the SF family, and

29
00:01:46,216 --> 00:01:50,316
SF Mono is a new

30
00:01:50,806 --> 00:01:52,426
and it comes in many ways.

31
00:01:52,426 --> 00:01:57,236
We started with a light

32
00:01:58,116 --> 00:02:01,016
semi bold, and then we're

33
00:01:58,116 --> 00:02:01,016
semi bold, and then we're

34
00:02:01,066 --> 00:02:02,736
like bold and even heavy.

35
00:02:03,586 --> 00:02:06,936
So, all of these come

36
00:02:08,126 --> 00:02:11,636
And they cover the Latin,

37
00:02:11,636 --> 00:02:16,536
But, also the Cyrillic and the

38
00:02:16,536 --> 00:02:18,576
and all the weights

39
00:02:19,256 --> 00:02:22,966
So, SF Mono is a

40
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:26,536
But, it's also monospaced

41
00:02:28,436 --> 00:02:32,426
which means that if you change

42
00:02:32,426 --> 00:02:32,956
not reflow.

43
00:02:33,886 --> 00:02:35,006
Of course this was

44
00:02:35,006 --> 00:02:36,516
when we were designing

45
00:02:36,566 --> 00:02:38,726
So, we have to squeeze

46
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:43,826
But, we designed that SF Mono

47
00:02:43,826 --> 00:02:46,986
And so we tweaked some of the

48
00:02:46,986 --> 00:02:52,426
or the bracket braces, some of

49
00:02:53,586 --> 00:02:57,156
And of course SF Mono

50
00:02:57,156 --> 00:02:58,756
of choice of Swift Playgrounds.

51
00:02:59,806 --> 00:03:01,676
It's also in default in Xcode.

52
00:02:59,806 --> 00:03:01,676
It's also in default in Xcode.

53
00:03:02,206 --> 00:03:05,816
Check out the new

54
00:03:06,046 --> 00:03:08,836
Okay. So, that was small

55
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:10,626
and the new SF Mono family.

56
00:03:12,016 --> 00:03:16,016
Next I want to talk to you

57
00:03:16,016 --> 00:03:19,256
Get us all on the same page

58
00:03:19,256 --> 00:03:20,616
that can be confusing at times.

59
00:03:21,106 --> 00:03:23,046
So, before I get started I just

60
00:03:23,246 --> 00:03:24,766
which is that today we'll look

61
00:03:24,766 --> 00:03:27,606
at the Latin Cyrillic

62
00:03:28,176 --> 00:03:30,036
But, if you're interested

63
00:03:30,316 --> 00:03:32,646
and you should, there are,

64
00:03:32,876 --> 00:03:34,806
there were actually

65
00:03:34,806 --> 00:03:35,766
that you can catch on video.

66
00:03:36,136 --> 00:03:37,496
That talk exactly

67
00:03:38,686 --> 00:03:39,656
So, let's get started.

68
00:03:40,516 --> 00:03:41,216
What is text?

69
00:03:42,476 --> 00:03:45,006
Text encodes language, and

70
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:47,966
Text is the stuff that you type.

71
00:03:48,746 --> 00:03:50,796
It is the stuff that gets

72
00:03:51,196 --> 00:03:52,136
and sent to your friends.

73
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:54,666
Now, what is text made of?

74
00:03:55,316 --> 00:03:58,166
It is made of, oops, characters.

75
00:03:58,986 --> 00:04:02,156
A character is an

76
00:03:58,986 --> 00:04:02,156
A character is an

77
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:05,476
and it literally is

78
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:09,236
Now, before you can

79
00:04:09,236 --> 00:04:13,026
of these you need representation

80
00:04:13,766 --> 00:04:15,756
a glyph is stored on your device

81
00:04:15,976 --> 00:04:19,086
as an outline, a

82
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:21,856
And it lives inside a font file.

83
00:04:23,386 --> 00:04:26,186
Now in a font file between

84
00:04:26,186 --> 00:04:28,016
there usually is

85
00:04:28,016 --> 00:04:29,856
However, things are

86
00:04:30,146 --> 00:04:33,356
There could be something

87
00:04:33,786 --> 00:04:37,686
which is a mechanism that

88
00:04:38,406 --> 00:04:41,436
and makes things

89
00:04:41,436 --> 00:04:44,916
For instance, you could have

90
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:47,716
for F or I, this

91
00:04:48,326 --> 00:04:49,686
And instead of getting

92
00:04:49,686 --> 00:04:52,096
you actually get just one,

93
00:04:52,096 --> 00:04:53,476
into what is called a ligature.

94
00:04:54,176 --> 00:04:55,656
Now, this ligature

95
00:04:55,656 --> 00:04:58,946
by a typographic feature, which

96
00:04:59,046 --> 00:04:59,956
Not all fonts do this.

97
00:05:00,526 --> 00:05:02,826
Some fonts have optional

98
00:05:03,186 --> 00:05:04,536
that change the shape of digits.

99
00:05:04,536 --> 00:05:07,666
For instance, San Francisco

100
00:05:07,716 --> 00:05:10,976
for the numeral 6 that

101
00:05:10,976 --> 00:05:12,086
to make it a little

102
00:05:12,746 --> 00:05:15,746
Now, fonts have multiple styles,

103
00:05:16,996 --> 00:05:18,176
which of course look

104
00:05:18,316 --> 00:05:20,886
Some fonts have just two styles.

105
00:05:21,246 --> 00:05:22,566
Some fonts have many, many more.

106
00:05:22,786 --> 00:05:25,496
And you may have heard some of

107
00:05:25,726 --> 00:05:27,026
Bold Italic, Condensed.

108
00:05:27,026 --> 00:05:28,346
All these are style names.

109
00:05:29,086 --> 00:05:33,996
Now, what holds all of these

110
00:05:33,996 --> 00:05:34,896
if you will.

111
00:05:35,266 --> 00:05:38,956
And that is the idea of a set

112
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:42,036
There are many, many typefaces.

113
00:05:42,036 --> 00:05:43,916
And you may have seen or

114
00:05:44,746 --> 00:05:47,966
Now, what do you do with

115
00:05:48,616 --> 00:05:53,676
Typography is using type to

116
00:05:54,446 --> 00:05:58,956
Typography is the foundation of

117
00:06:00,256 --> 00:06:01,976
So, we just saw a few terms.

118
00:06:02,046 --> 00:06:05,696
We saw text, text is

119
00:06:06,116 --> 00:06:10,046
characters are encoded by

120
00:06:10,526 --> 00:06:11,716
Between characters and glyphs,

121
00:06:11,976 --> 00:06:16,516
typographic features can alter

122
00:06:17,346 --> 00:06:19,296
They're all stored in what

123
00:06:20,116 --> 00:06:22,676
which can have common

124
00:06:23,856 --> 00:06:27,236
They are all grouped under

125
00:06:27,236 --> 00:06:29,406
which is the design idea

126
00:06:30,136 --> 00:06:32,346
And typography is

127
00:06:32,346 --> 00:06:35,166
of this stuff to convey text.

128
00:06:35,776 --> 00:06:38,836
Now, writers and editors, the

129
00:06:39,496 --> 00:06:42,696
concern themselves with text.

130
00:06:42,826 --> 00:06:45,666
The characters are defined

131
00:06:45,826 --> 00:06:46,726
So, you don't have

132
00:06:48,286 --> 00:06:51,116
And the type designers and font

133
00:06:51,986 --> 00:06:56,986
who come up with the design

134
00:06:57,146 --> 00:06:58,286
and make them into fonts.

135
00:06:58,286 --> 00:07:01,346
And then create the

136
00:06:58,286 --> 00:07:01,346
And then create the

137
00:07:01,346 --> 00:07:02,906
that you can then alter.

138
00:07:03,486 --> 00:07:07,996
Now, typographers are the

139
00:07:08,656 --> 00:07:10,136
And I have some good

140
00:07:10,426 --> 00:07:12,046
which is that you

141
00:07:12,046 --> 00:07:14,156
As matter of fact, we

142
00:07:14,396 --> 00:07:16,406
Whenever we change a font,

143
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:17,816
when we change the point size,

144
00:07:18,136 --> 00:07:19,756
this is all the act

145
00:07:20,796 --> 00:07:23,416
Now, as typographers of

146
00:07:24,306 --> 00:07:28,186
But, you can also alter the

147
00:07:28,646 --> 00:07:30,466
Choose them, combine the styles,

148
00:07:30,746 --> 00:07:31,906
and alter the typographic

149
00:07:31,946 --> 00:07:33,516
Turn the optional ones on.

150
00:07:35,706 --> 00:07:37,296
Okay. I am almost done.

151
00:07:37,546 --> 00:07:39,016
But, I have a few more terms.

152
00:07:39,256 --> 00:07:41,236
And they actually have to do

153
00:07:41,236 --> 00:07:44,006
with the negative

154
00:07:44,636 --> 00:07:47,086
So, I just showed to you what

155
00:07:47,086 --> 00:07:48,426
that represents a character.

156
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:51,176
And in a font it's

157
00:07:51,406 --> 00:07:55,476
But, it also has a width,

158
00:07:56,146 --> 00:08:00,256
Now, if I picked out a space

159
00:07:56,146 --> 00:08:00,256
Now, if I picked out a space

160
00:08:00,256 --> 00:08:03,976
in a line, I get this rhythm,

161
00:08:03,976 --> 00:08:05,486
So, type designers alter this

162
00:08:05,766 --> 00:08:08,936
to get an even rhythm

163
00:08:10,016 --> 00:08:12,916
Spacing is built into the font

164
00:08:13,196 --> 00:08:14,806
But, you can change tracking.

165
00:08:15,506 --> 00:08:17,536
Tracking is a modifier

166
00:08:17,536 --> 00:08:23,066
And it can either be neutral,

167
00:08:24,036 --> 00:08:26,716
And it is global for all

168
00:08:27,026 --> 00:08:29,656
And it either moves the apart

169
00:08:30,016 --> 00:08:31,286
which is actually useful

170
00:08:31,286 --> 00:08:33,106
when you're doing

171
00:08:33,106 --> 00:08:34,916
You'll probably want to bring

172
00:08:35,296 --> 00:08:36,645
and pull it together

173
00:08:37,226 --> 00:08:41,275
Now, tracking can be confused

174
00:08:41,806 --> 00:08:43,765
And kerning really is

175
00:08:43,966 --> 00:08:45,576
for individual pairs of glyphs.

176
00:08:45,656 --> 00:08:47,746
So, in this case the

177
00:08:47,746 --> 00:08:51,356
and so the font has a kerning

178
00:08:51,426 --> 00:08:52,446
bring them closer together.

179
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:56,016
The kerning table again, is

180
00:08:56,016 --> 00:08:57,206
and put inside of the font.

181
00:08:57,206 --> 00:08:57,986
And you don't control it.

182
00:08:57,986 --> 00:08:59,066
It just happens automatically.

183
00:09:00,576 --> 00:09:03,706
However, leading, which is

184
00:09:04,006 --> 00:09:05,076
is something you can control.

185
00:09:05,746 --> 00:09:09,566
So, the name leading comes

186
00:09:09,566 --> 00:09:14,266
when to put lines of type

187
00:09:14,366 --> 00:09:16,766
you would have stick pieces

188
00:09:18,376 --> 00:09:27,116
So, we just saw spacing,

189
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:29,896
Spacing and kerning

190
00:09:30,726 --> 00:09:33,746
But, tracking and

191
00:09:35,106 --> 00:09:37,246
And that is really all I

192
00:09:37,246 --> 00:09:40,626
So, now you are all caught

193
00:09:41,836 --> 00:09:44,486
Now, let's look at some

194
00:09:45,116 --> 00:09:47,006
We start with legibility.

195
00:09:47,006 --> 00:09:50,566
The legibility has to do

196
00:09:51,256 --> 00:09:52,616
and distinguishing them

197
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:55,046
You may be familiar

198
00:09:55,246 --> 00:09:59,956
that some typefaces have

199
00:10:00,106 --> 00:10:03,166
However, what is not legible

200
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:05,556
at one size is actually

201
00:10:05,556 --> 00:10:07,896
in another size.

202
00:10:08,046 --> 00:10:10,756
Scale is connected

203
00:10:11,976 --> 00:10:14,546
And when you alter the

204
00:10:14,626 --> 00:10:17,036
details that were

205
00:10:17,036 --> 00:10:18,716
and not visible become visible.

206
00:10:19,056 --> 00:10:20,976
So, what is affected is

207
00:10:22,426 --> 00:10:27,096
Now, in these situations

208
00:10:27,526 --> 00:10:29,366
like road signage.

209
00:10:29,616 --> 00:10:31,646
So, you're driving on

210
00:10:32,266 --> 00:10:34,536
that you see is very

211
00:10:35,146 --> 00:10:37,716
but it's far away from you.

212
00:10:38,256 --> 00:10:40,426
And so a scale is not just

213
00:10:40,426 --> 00:10:43,576
but also distance from the

214
00:10:43,636 --> 00:10:44,496
to the reading surface.

215
00:10:45,706 --> 00:10:47,776
Now, in these situations

216
00:10:47,776 --> 00:10:51,026
to small scale typography

217
00:10:51,026 --> 00:10:53,106
So, for instance, bringing

218
00:10:53,106 --> 00:10:55,836
or making the type bolder may

219
00:10:57,126 --> 00:10:59,116
But legibility does

220
00:10:59,726 --> 00:11:01,206
It also applies to layouts.

221
00:10:59,726 --> 00:11:01,206
It also applies to layouts.

222
00:11:01,806 --> 00:11:05,816
It's probably very obvious

223
00:11:05,816 --> 00:11:08,816
where hierarchy is clear

224
00:11:08,816 --> 00:11:10,116
so legible at another scale.

225
00:11:10,686 --> 00:11:12,726
And the issue there is the

226
00:11:12,726 --> 00:11:15,896
It actually increases very much.

227
00:11:16,446 --> 00:11:18,076
So, what you could do

228
00:11:18,076 --> 00:11:20,226
is you could spread

229
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:22,446
But, often times it's

230
00:11:22,446 --> 00:11:25,336
to rethink your hierarchy and

231
00:11:25,336 --> 00:11:27,276
your layout for different

232
00:11:27,276 --> 00:11:33,406
Now, if you want to know more

233
00:11:33,406 --> 00:11:35,666
on Friday that talks

234
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:38,666
which is the methodology

235
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:41,436
And also they'll have tips on

236
00:11:41,436 --> 00:11:44,506
which is the important part.

237
00:11:44,686 --> 00:11:49,306
Now, the scale and density,

238
00:11:49,986 --> 00:11:51,586
and layouts, but

239
00:11:52,156 --> 00:11:53,366
So, let me give you an example.

240
00:11:54,206 --> 00:11:54,986
What is this glyph?

241
00:11:55,406 --> 00:11:56,086
What is it called?

242
00:11:57,036 --> 00:11:58,216
Of course it's the at sign.

243
00:11:58,446 --> 00:12:00,496
But, in Italy we have

244
00:11:58,446 --> 00:12:00,496
But, in Italy we have

245
00:12:00,496 --> 00:12:03,056
We call it chiocciola,

246
00:12:03,586 --> 00:12:08,266
So, when we have to design

247
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:10,426
we started with SF Mono, sorry,

248
00:12:10,426 --> 00:12:11,956
we started with the

249
00:12:12,096 --> 00:12:14,676
And of course we did this, all

250
00:12:15,356 --> 00:12:17,556
However, when we have,

251
00:12:17,826 --> 00:12:19,596
in the right context and scale,

252
00:12:19,596 --> 00:12:21,336
we realized the density

253
00:12:21,746 --> 00:12:24,146
It was just getting muddy

254
00:12:24,506 --> 00:12:27,446
So, we came up with a

255
00:12:28,326 --> 00:12:31,046
Now, let me blow it up.

256
00:12:31,046 --> 00:12:36,116
So, in this example,

257
00:12:36,116 --> 00:12:37,816
of the glyph by very much.

258
00:12:38,326 --> 00:12:40,946
And we did that by

259
00:12:40,946 --> 00:12:42,956
which is very critical

260
00:12:44,356 --> 00:12:48,996
Now, consider also the H, M

261
00:12:49,996 --> 00:12:54,356
Now, if I blow them up really

262
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:57,096
that the strokes aren't

263
00:12:57,386 --> 00:12:58,396
And that is because you,

264
00:12:58,626 --> 00:13:00,326
when they are big you

265
00:12:58,626 --> 00:13:00,326
when they are big you

266
00:13:00,366 --> 00:13:01,646
but when they are

267
00:13:01,726 --> 00:13:03,276
So, we're sort of

268
00:13:03,276 --> 00:13:06,326
that they have the same density.

269
00:13:06,396 --> 00:13:09,776
Okay. So, imagine you're getting

270
00:13:10,306 --> 00:13:11,356
And you're trying to

271
00:13:11,356 --> 00:13:12,446
and where you're trying to go.

272
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:14,936
Now, you're probably

273
00:13:14,936 --> 00:13:15,816
probably to Church Avenue.

274
00:13:15,816 --> 00:13:16,926
But, where are you?

275
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:18,246
I know where you are.

276
00:13:18,766 --> 00:13:20,826
You're in New York,

277
00:13:21,896 --> 00:13:27,676
Now, I also happen to know, I

278
00:13:27,676 --> 00:13:29,486
to know that this is not exactly

279
00:13:29,486 --> 00:13:31,616
So, I recreate that sign with

280
00:13:32,386 --> 00:13:34,516
But, what I'm trying to

281
00:13:34,516 --> 00:13:39,196
of typographic voice, which is

282
00:13:39,196 --> 00:13:42,306
to a different style, even

283
00:13:42,676 --> 00:13:45,316
not only does that sign

284
00:13:45,606 --> 00:13:47,696
but it doesn't feel the same.

285
00:13:48,086 --> 00:13:52,196
Okay. So, typefaces

286
00:13:52,196 --> 00:13:54,136
and this does not feel

287
00:13:54,856 --> 00:13:57,296
and nor does this one.

288
00:13:57,576 --> 00:13:59,596
So, this voice property

289
00:13:59,596 --> 00:14:02,266
And actually it helps

290
00:13:59,596 --> 00:14:02,266
And actually it helps

291
00:14:02,636 --> 00:14:04,876
So, for instance, I am

292
00:14:04,876 --> 00:14:06,586
and now I'm playing a game.

293
00:14:06,826 --> 00:14:09,656
Maybe that's not so appropriate

294
00:14:09,656 --> 00:14:12,776
So, typefaces really help

295
00:14:12,926 --> 00:14:15,016
and helping your user

296
00:14:15,656 --> 00:14:19,236
Okay. So, these are the

297
00:14:19,236 --> 00:14:23,206
We saw legibility,

298
00:14:23,716 --> 00:14:26,166
So, now I want to talk

299
00:14:32,336 --> 00:14:34,406
When we do typography

300
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:37,706
you have three fundamental

301
00:14:38,546 --> 00:14:42,156
The first one is system font,

302
00:14:42,776 --> 00:14:44,906
and the third one

303
00:14:46,696 --> 00:14:49,956
Now, a system font you already

304
00:14:50,326 --> 00:14:52,666
And it feels native to the

305
00:14:52,756 --> 00:14:58,336
To access it the system font

306
00:14:58,456 --> 00:15:01,096
watchOS, tvOS, and the macOS.

307
00:14:58,456 --> 00:15:01,096
watchOS, tvOS, and the macOS.

308
00:15:02,156 --> 00:15:05,176
So, NSFont and UIFont

309
00:15:05,866 --> 00:15:07,066
And they have a lot of benefits.

310
00:15:07,116 --> 00:15:10,756
They give you access to the

311
00:15:10,756 --> 00:15:13,816
of the nine weights, but also

312
00:15:14,456 --> 00:15:17,306
Basically the letters

313
00:15:17,306 --> 00:15:20,336
or further apart automatically,

314
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:21,746
that you request

315
00:15:22,706 --> 00:15:25,106
You also get such specific

316
00:15:26,136 --> 00:15:31,456
And you get access for the Bold

317
00:15:31,456 --> 00:15:32,886
in the settings in iOS.

318
00:15:33,426 --> 00:15:35,466
People can turn it on

319
00:15:35,466 --> 00:15:37,006
on all their devices bold.

320
00:15:37,626 --> 00:15:42,496
Now, the second tool you have

321
00:15:42,496 --> 00:15:43,696
And it's a great tool.

322
00:15:43,696 --> 00:15:45,496
It's available on

323
00:15:46,326 --> 00:15:48,366
And dynamic type is

324
00:15:48,836 --> 00:15:52,196
The first one is the

325
00:15:52,346 --> 00:15:53,696
preferredFont forTextStyle.

326
00:15:54,396 --> 00:15:57,196
And these give you access

327
00:15:57,196 --> 00:16:00,226
that give you fonts that are

328
00:15:57,196 --> 00:16:00,226
that give you fonts that are

329
00:16:00,226 --> 00:16:03,836
So, you can request a font for

330
00:16:03,836 --> 00:16:05,616
and you get fonts that

331
00:16:05,616 --> 00:16:07,646
But, they're tweaked

332
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:11,686
But, dynamic type is also

333
00:16:12,056 --> 00:16:15,456
which you may be familiar with

334
00:16:15,826 --> 00:16:17,576
So, people can go

335
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:19,766
they can move the

336
00:16:20,026 --> 00:16:22,426
and they can change the global

337
00:16:22,566 --> 00:16:23,766
It's a great accessibility

338
00:16:27,696 --> 00:16:31,106
Now, if you use dynamic type and

339
00:16:31,436 --> 00:16:33,716
dynamic type support is

340
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:37,646
However, if you're

341
00:16:37,826 --> 00:16:40,156
or you call a system font

342
00:16:40,156 --> 00:16:42,116
to do some work to

343
00:16:42,476 --> 00:16:43,166
But, it's really easy.

344
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:44,636
And let me show you

345
00:16:44,636 --> 00:16:47,836
First you have to

346
00:16:48,866 --> 00:16:50,886
then you can have a

347
00:16:50,886 --> 00:16:53,676
with content size

348
00:16:53,676 --> 00:16:55,846
to override this

349
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:58,776
This is a method

350
00:16:59,076 --> 00:17:00,226
You control the subclasses.

351
00:16:59,076 --> 00:17:00,226
You control the subclasses.

352
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:03,436
Then you update your fonts

353
00:17:04,386 --> 00:17:05,876
and you relayout,

354
00:17:06,586 --> 00:17:08,366
So, let's see these steps

355
00:17:09,146 --> 00:17:11,435
How do you actually

356
00:17:12,205 --> 00:17:12,986
Well, that's easy.

357
00:17:12,986 --> 00:17:16,776
You just drag it into Xcode, and

358
00:17:16,836 --> 00:17:17,646
in the info plist list.

359
00:17:17,715 --> 00:17:19,246
There is a key for it.

360
00:17:20,415 --> 00:17:23,006
Now, for the concise

361
00:17:23,006 --> 00:17:27,396
to of course have a lookup table

362
00:17:27,396 --> 00:17:29,236
and possibly weights,

363
00:17:29,236 --> 00:17:31,956
or even leading, depending on

364
00:17:32,866 --> 00:17:35,596
So, I have a lookup table that

365
00:17:35,736 --> 00:17:39,166
I have a tool pool, a

366
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:39,976
leading, and tracking.

367
00:17:40,376 --> 00:17:43,476
And the symbols that you

368
00:17:43,476 --> 00:17:44,246
size categories.

369
00:17:44,576 --> 00:17:45,946
Notice that they

370
00:17:46,026 --> 00:17:47,176
than the notches in the slider.

371
00:17:47,736 --> 00:17:51,486
Because there's five

372
00:17:52,246 --> 00:17:54,326
people can turn on in their

373
00:17:54,826 --> 00:17:57,016
So, when you went

374
00:17:57,016 --> 00:17:58,136
remember about these as well.

375
00:17:58,136 --> 00:17:59,976
Now, once you have that,

376
00:18:00,196 --> 00:18:03,076
you just override

377
00:18:03,296 --> 00:18:03,946
DidChange method.

378
00:18:03,946 --> 00:18:07,716
And inside of there

379
00:18:07,716 --> 00:18:10,596
You can have code that

380
00:18:10,596 --> 00:18:11,506
and whatever it looks like,

381
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:13,666
can adjust the font

382
00:18:15,016 --> 00:18:20,656
So, when you're inside of that

383
00:18:20,656 --> 00:18:22,776
trait collection of

384
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:25,226
And look up the preferred

385
00:18:26,256 --> 00:18:27,966
And then you just

386
00:18:27,966 --> 00:18:29,786
of your lookup table

387
00:18:31,236 --> 00:18:32,606
Now, step 5 is relayout.

388
00:18:32,846 --> 00:18:36,056
But, if you're using auto layout

389
00:18:36,056 --> 00:18:37,846
If you're interested in

390
00:18:37,886 --> 00:18:39,996
there are sessions

391
00:18:39,996 --> 00:18:43,646
about this specific topic.

392
00:18:43,646 --> 00:18:44,006
All right.

393
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:46,226
So, we just saw how to

394
00:18:46,226 --> 00:18:47,556
with custom fonts.

395
00:18:48,106 --> 00:18:50,306
But, imagine you want to

396
00:18:50,616 --> 00:18:52,976
How do you actually go about it?

397
00:18:53,116 --> 00:18:55,076
Now, if you're getting

398
00:18:55,076 --> 00:18:58,656
to use custom fonts,

399
00:18:58,656 --> 00:19:00,686
with one typeface at a time.

400
00:18:58,656 --> 00:19:00,686
with one typeface at a time.

401
00:19:01,276 --> 00:19:02,656
It's actually much

402
00:19:03,196 --> 00:19:05,176
But, more importantly,

403
00:19:05,176 --> 00:19:08,136
that you're considering, try to

404
00:19:08,456 --> 00:19:09,836
because it really

405
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:11,536
Typefaces are tools.

406
00:19:11,706 --> 00:19:13,956
They are designed by people

407
00:19:14,126 --> 00:19:17,106
And understanding the purpose

408
00:19:17,106 --> 00:19:18,746
of the font, as the

409
00:19:19,266 --> 00:19:23,406
And also consider knobs

410
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:26,576
Kerning is not something you

411
00:19:26,576 --> 00:19:27,876
from your app context.

412
00:19:27,876 --> 00:19:29,336
So if the font is not kerning.

413
00:19:29,696 --> 00:19:31,406
Well, you might want to

414
00:19:31,816 --> 00:19:33,456
But, however, if

415
00:19:33,456 --> 00:19:35,436
that is too tight you

416
00:19:35,756 --> 00:19:36,516
So, no worries.

417
00:19:38,296 --> 00:19:38,936
All right.

418
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:42,216
So, we just saw system

419
00:19:42,216 --> 00:19:43,716
and we saw custom fonts.

420
00:19:45,086 --> 00:19:49,096
So, next I want to show you some

421
00:19:49,316 --> 00:19:52,696
to consider using

422
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:55,726
The first one I want

423
00:19:56,866 --> 00:19:58,156
Arrows are a great thing.

424
00:19:58,296 --> 00:20:01,226
They are useful for

425
00:19:58,296 --> 00:20:01,226
They are useful for

426
00:20:01,606 --> 00:20:03,356
But, also they're

427
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:05,816
where the information density

428
00:20:05,816 --> 00:20:07,566
to get just a little

429
00:20:08,276 --> 00:20:11,006
Now, arrows in a staff,

430
00:20:11,006 --> 00:20:12,326
in the font as characters.

431
00:20:12,326 --> 00:20:14,436
So, you can copy and paste

432
00:20:14,516 --> 00:20:16,776
in Xcode for instance, and

433
00:20:17,346 --> 00:20:19,476
But, more importantly

434
00:20:20,026 --> 00:20:21,836
they are weight matched

435
00:20:22,276 --> 00:20:24,726
And if people change

436
00:20:24,836 --> 00:20:28,016
or use dynamic type, the

437
00:20:28,646 --> 00:20:32,546
Now, the second deal

438
00:20:32,546 --> 00:20:34,096
about is high-legibility

439
00:20:34,826 --> 00:20:38,146
I talked about alternates

440
00:20:38,746 --> 00:20:40,496
And we have the new

441
00:20:40,796 --> 00:20:42,496
which helps in situations

442
00:20:42,936 --> 00:20:44,216
If you're typesetting a string

443
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:46,826
where the context is

444
00:20:46,826 --> 00:20:50,276
which glyph is which, and maybe

445
00:20:50,276 --> 00:20:51,836
or type it somewhere else.

446
00:20:51,836 --> 00:20:53,606
They have to read it

447
00:20:53,606 --> 00:20:56,196
it has to be ambiguous

448
00:20:56,726 --> 00:20:59,216
So, there's a new statistic

449
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:02,196
of these glyphs to

450
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:02,196
of these glyphs to

451
00:21:02,196 --> 00:21:04,956
So, the I gets a serif,

452
00:21:05,446 --> 00:21:08,886
the L gets a little tail and

453
00:21:09,076 --> 00:21:09,716
from the eight.

454
00:21:10,206 --> 00:21:12,016
Now, these shapes we don't

455
00:21:12,016 --> 00:21:13,816
on all the time,

456
00:21:13,816 --> 00:21:15,556
they're pretty, they're

457
00:21:15,556 --> 00:21:18,986
And they're highly disruptive

458
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:20,596
and feel actually

459
00:21:20,966 --> 00:21:23,606
So, use them sparingly

460
00:21:24,426 --> 00:21:26,986
But, this is the

461
00:21:27,266 --> 00:21:29,646
And this code, by the way,

462
00:21:29,676 --> 00:21:31,186
and NSFont, is exactly the same.

463
00:21:31,846 --> 00:21:34,326
You start with the

464
00:21:34,566 --> 00:21:36,306
you derive a font

465
00:21:36,376 --> 00:21:40,926
And then you can modify

466
00:21:41,016 --> 00:21:45,366
And then derive another

467
00:21:45,636 --> 00:21:47,396
Next, the small caps.

468
00:21:49,026 --> 00:21:51,476
Now, I'm sure you're

469
00:21:51,786 --> 00:21:53,456
and lowercase letters as well.

470
00:21:53,836 --> 00:21:58,786
But, there is a third member of

471
00:21:58,786 --> 00:22:02,936
Now, small caps are a smaller

472
00:21:58,786 --> 00:22:02,936
Now, small caps are a smaller

473
00:22:02,986 --> 00:22:04,416
that align with the lowercase.

474
00:22:04,416 --> 00:22:07,376
And when I say align,

475
00:22:07,746 --> 00:22:09,386
They actually ought

476
00:22:10,046 --> 00:22:12,206
Now, when are they useful?

477
00:22:12,676 --> 00:22:13,766
Well, when you type

478
00:22:13,766 --> 00:22:15,316
like acronym, for instance.

479
00:22:16,466 --> 00:22:18,106
Acronyms or when you want

480
00:22:18,106 --> 00:22:19,796
to create subtle

481
00:22:19,796 --> 00:22:21,576
like you have the

482
00:22:21,576 --> 00:22:25,396
to de-emphasize another piece

483
00:22:25,776 --> 00:22:26,786
Let me show you a case study

484
00:22:26,786 --> 00:22:29,896
of how we use small

485
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:34,496
Now, you have this paragraph,

486
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:36,496
of like a list on the

487
00:22:36,496 --> 00:22:37,286
on the right hand side.

488
00:22:37,596 --> 00:22:40,536
And you want the text of the

489
00:22:40,536 --> 00:22:41,496
to stand out a little bit.

490
00:22:42,096 --> 00:22:45,046
Now, if you look at his as

491
00:22:45,046 --> 00:22:48,456
of start telling that that

492
00:22:48,456 --> 00:22:50,536
of trumping everything

493
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:52,116
It looks a little bit too large.

494
00:22:53,136 --> 00:22:55,756
Now, one thing you could

495
00:22:55,756 --> 00:22:58,356
you could change the point

496
00:22:58,676 --> 00:23:01,656
But, if you did that it would

497
00:22:58,676 --> 00:23:01,656
But, if you did that it would

498
00:23:01,656 --> 00:23:02,516
and too close.

499
00:23:02,516 --> 00:23:03,426
So, the density will start

500
00:23:03,426 --> 00:23:05,816
to be non-matched

501
00:23:05,966 --> 00:23:08,016
So, what you can do, small caps.

502
00:23:08,336 --> 00:23:11,376
Small caps preserve

503
00:23:11,766 --> 00:23:13,506
But, they also preserve

504
00:23:13,506 --> 00:23:14,456
and the stroke thickness.

505
00:23:15,516 --> 00:23:18,406
Now, there are two fundamental

506
00:23:18,406 --> 00:23:20,386
to get small caps

507
00:23:21,086 --> 00:23:24,096
And they have to do

508
00:23:24,096 --> 00:23:28,446
between the typographic features

509
00:23:28,986 --> 00:23:31,846
So, imagine you have a piece

510
00:23:32,476 --> 00:23:35,166
and you're turning on the small

511
00:23:35,636 --> 00:23:37,686
you get a piece of text

512
00:23:38,236 --> 00:23:38,926
This looks good.

513
00:23:39,986 --> 00:23:43,556
Now, if you get, if you have

514
00:23:43,556 --> 00:23:45,406
upper and lowercase, and

515
00:23:45,406 --> 00:23:47,846
from uppercase feature,

516
00:23:48,596 --> 00:23:50,136
This does not look good.

517
00:23:50,656 --> 00:23:51,556
The problem with this one is

518
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:54,406
that the capital letters are

519
00:23:54,406 --> 00:23:56,076
And they almost look

520
00:23:56,576 --> 00:23:58,226
So, please try not to

521
00:23:58,936 --> 00:24:02,126
And lastly, if you have a

522
00:23:58,936 --> 00:24:02,126
And lastly, if you have a

523
00:24:02,126 --> 00:24:04,686
and you turn on the small

524
00:24:04,946 --> 00:24:07,526
you get all lowercase, which

525
00:24:07,526 --> 00:24:08,936
But at least it doesn't

526
00:24:09,606 --> 00:24:10,536
So, we're fine.

527
00:24:11,386 --> 00:24:14,186
Now, the small caps from

528
00:24:14,186 --> 00:24:16,176
the code is exactly the

529
00:24:16,176 --> 00:24:19,026
that I showed you earlier for

530
00:24:19,516 --> 00:24:21,366
And you just have to

531
00:24:21,366 --> 00:24:24,376
and the selector.

532
00:24:24,476 --> 00:24:26,936
Now, there's another way of

533
00:24:26,936 --> 00:24:28,986
and it's from a lowercase

534
00:24:29,346 --> 00:24:33,126
Now, I'm sorry, if you have

535
00:24:33,426 --> 00:24:36,356
and you turn on small

536
00:24:36,806 --> 00:24:38,276
you get all uppercase,

537
00:24:38,676 --> 00:24:40,096
which again is not really

538
00:24:40,096 --> 00:24:41,616
But, at least it

539
00:24:42,596 --> 00:24:45,006
Now, when you turn on

540
00:24:45,036 --> 00:24:48,226
on a mixed case string,

541
00:24:48,526 --> 00:24:51,046
You get a mixed caps

542
00:24:51,046 --> 00:24:51,716
which is legitimate.

543
00:24:52,236 --> 00:24:54,806
We actually do use this

544
00:24:54,926 --> 00:24:56,026
It's certain zoom levels.

545
00:24:57,126 --> 00:24:58,516
Small caps are really

546
00:24:58,516 --> 00:25:01,406
And this is one way to create a

547
00:24:58,516 --> 00:25:01,406
And this is one way to create a

548
00:25:02,156 --> 00:25:03,456
So, again, this is fine.

549
00:25:04,496 --> 00:25:06,996
Now, if you have an all

550
00:25:06,996 --> 00:25:08,316
on the small caps

551
00:25:08,606 --> 00:25:11,336
you get all small caps,

552
00:25:12,496 --> 00:25:15,006
So, again the code to do

553
00:25:15,006 --> 00:25:17,306
I just changed the piece

554
00:25:18,456 --> 00:25:20,046
And one thing you

555
00:25:20,046 --> 00:25:21,916
you can actually turn

556
00:25:22,186 --> 00:25:24,436
So, depending where you got

557
00:25:24,656 --> 00:25:28,026
if it's under your control, if

558
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:32,276
to turn both at once

559
00:25:32,606 --> 00:25:34,566
Now, there's one

560
00:25:34,916 --> 00:25:36,706
Which is, well they're

561
00:25:36,706 --> 00:25:38,256
but there is something

562
00:25:38,666 --> 00:25:44,226
Which is that they also operate

563
00:25:44,436 --> 00:25:45,996
but also on numbers

564
00:25:46,736 --> 00:25:48,296
And you may be wondering why.

565
00:25:48,976 --> 00:25:50,696
The reason is because you

566
00:25:50,696 --> 00:25:53,436
like this, and you want to

567
00:25:53,726 --> 00:25:56,256
So, we support small cap

568
00:25:56,256 --> 00:25:58,266
and all of these in system font.

569
00:25:59,556 --> 00:26:00,136
All right.

570
00:25:59,556 --> 00:26:00,136
All right.

571
00:26:00,216 --> 00:26:03,956
So, we just saw some details

572
00:26:04,176 --> 00:26:06,786
high-legibility alternates,

573
00:26:07,996 --> 00:26:11,196
And that's really all

574
00:26:11,336 --> 00:26:14,476
We just saw the San Francisco

575
00:26:14,626 --> 00:26:16,566
with the new SF Mono

576
00:26:16,566 --> 00:26:17,256
We hope you enjoy it.

577
00:26:17,256 --> 00:26:19,486
We saw some terminology.

578
00:26:19,796 --> 00:26:22,316
We looked at some typographic

579
00:26:22,316 --> 00:26:24,236
and yeah, design concepts.

580
00:26:24,476 --> 00:26:25,556
And then we looked

581
00:26:25,946 --> 00:26:27,976
And lastly we saw some details.

582
00:26:27,976 --> 00:26:30,626
Some small new feature that you

583
00:26:31,646 --> 00:26:32,746
Now, for more information,

584
00:26:32,906 --> 00:26:36,406
at this URL you will find

585
00:26:36,406 --> 00:26:40,346
But, you'll also find a

586
00:26:40,346 --> 00:26:41,496
to sites that can

587
00:26:41,496 --> 00:26:43,286
in your new journey

588
00:26:44,646 --> 00:26:46,786
And there also related sessions.

589
00:26:46,836 --> 00:26:50,306
These have yet to happen,

590
00:26:51,056 --> 00:26:53,606
There is, the first session

591
00:26:53,606 --> 00:26:55,306
that will greatly help

592
00:26:55,406 --> 00:26:58,106
But, I don't want to spoil it.

593
00:26:58,106 --> 00:26:59,686
The other two sessions

594
00:26:59,686 --> 00:27:00,926
with making your apps adaptive.

595
00:26:59,686 --> 00:27:00,926
with making your apps adaptive.

596
00:27:00,926 --> 00:27:03,436
So, auto layout topics.

597
00:27:04,346 --> 00:27:07,226
The iterative design gives

598
00:27:07,656 --> 00:27:09,716
and of how to evaluate

599
00:27:10,506 --> 00:27:13,156
And then, What's new in Auto

600
00:27:13,316 --> 00:27:13,856
It's really good too.

601
00:27:14,946 --> 00:27:15,606
And that's it.

602
00:27:15,706 --> 00:27:16,486
Thank you very much.

603
00:27:17,508 --> 00:27:19,508
