00:00:30,386 --> 00:00:32,735
My name's Woody.

00:00:32,735 --> 00:00:34,466
I work in software

00:00:34,466 --> 00:00:35,996
I'd like to welcome

00:00:36,076 --> 00:00:38,376
both those of you here in

who are watching from

00:00:41,976 --> 00:00:44,036
There's a couple things I'd

11
00:00:44,036 --> 00:00:45,276
in the next 40 minutes.

12
00:00:45,646 --> 00:00:46,916
We're going to take

13
00:00:47,056 --> 00:00:49,456
that you can today start

14
00:00:50,086 --> 00:00:51,646
Then, we'll take a

15
00:00:52,516 --> 00:00:54,226
We'll take a look at

16
00:00:54,226 --> 00:00:56,646

And in the latter half of the

20

from my presentation last

21
00:01:06,106 --> 00:01:06,786
So, let's get going.

22
00:01:08,126 --> 00:01:11,366
Last year in the session at one

23
00:01:11,656 --> 00:01:13,486
that was describing a scenario.

24
00:01:13,486 --> 00:01:15,326
You were describing something

25
00:01:15,326 --> 00:01:18,316
to be quite familiar

26
00:01:19,016 --> 00:01:22,076
You've got your boss that's

27
00:01:22,076 --> 00:01:25,746
for features and the features

28
00:01:25,746 --> 00:01:27,036
to get paid, so you do that.

29
00:01:27,826 --> 00:01:29,506
Then you've got your

30
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:31,206
to fix the bugs that

31
00:01:31,736 --> 00:01:34,396
And you take pride in your work

32
00:01:34,706 --> 00:01:36,666
Some technical debt that

33
00:01:36,916 --> 00:01:39,546
Sometimes I think about building

34
00:01:39,546 --> 00:01:40,896
up a pile of Jenga blocks.

35
00:01:41,036 --> 00:01:42,446
In the first version,

36
00:01:42,446 --> 00:01:44,136
and you start piling

37
00:01:44,136 --> 00:01:47,416
and then it becomes unstable and

38
00:01:47,416 --> 00:01:49,896
So, you want to take a step

39
00:01:49,896 --> 00:01:51,116
of the lower-level issues.

40
00:01:52,756 --> 00:01:57,886
With all these things,

41
00:01:58,256 --> 00:01:59,686
And we pile on new API.

42
00:02:00,566 --> 00:02:04,656
And then we give you

43
00:02:04,656 --> 00:02:06,366
and it breaks source

44
00:02:06,526 --> 00:02:07,976
but introduces some

45
00:02:08,386 --> 00:02:11,966
And you were warned, so

46
00:02:13,026 --> 00:02:15,566
And then we introduced

47
00:02:15,736 --> 00:02:18,336
and new extension points and

48
00:02:18,336 --> 00:02:19,766
like Siri and Messages.

49
00:02:20,296 --> 00:02:23,366
And if you want to think of your

50
00:02:23,366 --> 00:02:25,796
of a run loop with all these

51
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,206
well, you know what

52
00:02:27,206 --> 00:02:28,026
There's too much stuff.

53
00:02:28,686 --> 00:02:30,496
So, what you do?

54
00:02:30,496 --> 00:02:32,476
What are some things

55
00:02:32,806 --> 00:02:34,366
to get ready for the fall?

56
00:02:35,036 --> 00:02:37,526
First of all, if you were to

57
00:02:37,526 --> 00:02:42,726
of iOS 8 and 9, you would

58
00:02:42,876 --> 00:02:44,436
So, there's really no

59
00:02:44,436 --> 00:02:46,126
of those deployment

60
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:47,426
Let's get rid of that.

61
00:02:47,806 --> 00:02:49,896
In fact, the general idea is

62
00:02:49,896 --> 00:02:53,256
that you take the current

63
00:02:53,766 --> 00:02:55,376
and then set your

64
00:02:55,376 --> 00:02:57,916
to one version back, maybe 8.4.

65
00:02:58,436 --> 00:03:01,416
But don't go to 8.3 or 8.2

66
00:02:58,436 --> 00:03:01,416
But don't go to 8.3 or 8.2

00:03:03,366 --> 00:03:06,646
that we've implemented under

When we come out with iOS 10

70
00:03:10,926 --> 00:03:14,876
set your deployment

71
00:03:15,106 --> 00:03:17,486
Next, Issue Navigator.

72
00:03:18,036 --> 00:03:20,456
Resolve those issues.

73
00:03:20,836 --> 00:03:22,146
Take a look at them

74
00:03:23,096 --> 00:03:26,566
When we tell you that

75
00:03:26,566 --> 00:03:29,646
that there is a deprecated API,

76
00:03:29,646 --> 00:03:32,426
of reasons, including to

77
00:03:32,686 --> 00:03:34,686
or to better, have

78
00:03:34,686 --> 00:03:37,966
or to permit more performance

79
00:03:37,966 --> 00:03:39,556
in the arguments return values.

80
00:03:39,766 --> 00:03:44,366
And there's really no excuse

81
00:03:44,526 --> 00:03:45,926
because we tell you right there.

82
00:03:45,926 --> 00:03:47,066
It tells you what to use.

83
00:03:47,336 --> 00:03:48,046
So, just use that.

84
00:03:48,156 --> 00:03:48,896
Switch over those.

85
00:03:50,116 --> 00:03:52,726
Next, you might decide that you

86
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:55,606
and we've had that for a

87
00:03:55,996 --> 00:04:00,366
But now we also have it

00:03:55,996 --> 00:04:00,366

92
00:04:06,146 --> 00:04:07,216
I really like this idea.

93
00:04:07,216 --> 00:04:09,046
I think it's fantastic,

94
00:04:09,046 --> 00:04:11,876
because it forces you and your

95
00:04:12,096 --> 00:04:14,666
It's far too easy to

96
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:16,866
and think you'll come back to

97

No one's going to do that,

107
00:04:38,556 --> 00:04:40,296
because this is how users

108
00:04:41,796 --> 00:04:44,076
Well, actually it's how

109
00:04:44,076 --> 00:04:45,076
of them interact with your app.

110
00:04:45,536 --> 00:04:48,276

features that we have built

113
00:04:54,946 --> 00:04:56,926
or want it or use it but then

114
00:04:56,926 --> 00:04:57,636
features in there?

115
00:04:57,636 --> 00:04:58,716
That's not fair.

So, resolve some of

118
00:05:01,016 --> 00:05:02,156
that comes to accessibility.

that you have to write.

Right? You know, if you

you're probably accustomed

138
00:05:53,356 --> 00:05:54,226

No, nothing.

If it doesn't migrate your code,

Then we have an opportunity

of our own technical

155

The public interface is the same

156
00:06:34,346 --> 00:06:36,436
but the implementation might

157
00:06:36,816 --> 00:06:42,166
And it could be that the way

158
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:43,036
that we didn't expect.

159
00:06:43,926 --> 00:06:44,966

The report isn't just

And it's not just

165
00:06:58,276 --> 00:07:00,206
and is not just sending

166
00:06:58,276 --> 00:07:00,206
and is not just sending

167
00:07:01,006 --> 00:07:04,006
The proper way to file

And then once you do

171
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:11,136
and then that's the

172
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:12,696
and post back into

00:07:18,076 --> 00:07:20,546
or when you report an

176

and you don't include the bug

177
00:07:23,946 --> 00:07:25,416
for us internally to

178
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:25,926
and get traction on it.

00:07:26,046 --> 00:07:26,976
So, do that.

180
00:07:30,136 --> 00:07:36,276
Next, you're probably

181
00:07:36,276 --> 00:07:38,386
of filing bug reports with us.

182
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:41,996
Because you've filed

183
00:07:41,996 --> 00:07:43,306
and nothing seems to happen.

184

00:07:51,386 --> 00:07:52,676
because you never

188
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:56,826

189
00:07:56,826 --> 00:07:59,866
and the engineer kind of

190
00:08:01,296 --> 00:08:04,246
I want to just assure

191
00:08:04,606 --> 00:08:05,426
One of the first things I did

192
00:08:05,426 --> 00:08:07,016
when I joined Apple

193
00:08:07,336 --> 00:08:10,526
in the bug tracking system,

194
00:08:10,856 --> 00:08:14,386
to find all the issues that I

195
00:08:14,386 --> 00:08:15,366
And a lot of them had traction.

196
00:08:15,566 --> 00:08:17,256
I just didn't have any

197
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:19,406
So, I wanted to show you

198
00:08:19,526 --> 00:08:20,306
we do look at them.

199
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:23,546
The other thing that I find

200
00:08:23,546 --> 00:08:24,336
of time filing a bug.

201
00:08:25,376 --> 00:08:27,126
A lot of time maybe you're

202
00:08:27,126 --> 00:08:29,606
You're trying a couple

203
00:08:29,606 --> 00:08:30,666
You're checking for regression.

204
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:31,806
Like, that's great stuff to do.

205
00:08:32,066 --> 00:08:33,976
It takes you maybe half

206
00:08:34,015 --> 00:08:36,385
and then you file

207
00:08:36,385 --> 00:08:37,116
and it says it's a dupe.

208
00:08:37,895 --> 00:08:39,525
And you're like, oh, I

209
00:08:39,525 --> 00:08:42,486
hour my life for something

210
00:08:43,476 --> 00:08:45,136
So, I just want to

211
00:08:46,516 --> 00:08:49,596
Because dupes first of all

212
00:08:49,596 --> 00:08:51,956
It's not like if you copy

213
00:08:52,146 --> 00:08:54,256
and you file a new bug with

214
00:08:54,476 --> 00:08:55,876
we're going to say oh,

215
00:08:55,876 --> 00:08:56,716
we should fix that first.

216
00:08:56,716 --> 00:08:57,846
It's not quite like that.

217
00:08:58,946 --> 00:09:01,026
What we do do with them though,

218
00:08:58,946 --> 00:09:01,026
What we do do with them though,

219
00:09:01,376 --> 00:09:02,666
it just means these

220
00:09:03,546 --> 00:09:06,116
We need dupes too, not

221
00:09:06,426 --> 00:09:09,906
but because we can have five

222
00:09:10,046 --> 00:09:10,736
same root issue.

223
00:09:11,706 --> 00:09:15,646
The first four don't give

224
00:09:15,646 --> 00:09:16,326
to be able to find it.

225
00:09:17,026 --> 00:09:20,436
But maybe it's your report,

226
00:09:20,436 --> 00:09:23,476
albeit, is a dupe, but

227
00:09:23,476 --> 00:09:24,926
that we need to find the issue.

228
00:09:26,386 --> 00:09:29,726
In fact, an Apple engineer

229
00:09:29,726 --> 00:09:36,316
for gosh, a couple decades,

230
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:41,316
Paul had said that each bug

231
00:09:42,406 --> 00:09:42,776
All right.

232
00:09:43,236 --> 00:09:44,626
So, in summary, things

233
00:09:44,976 --> 00:09:45,646
Fix your warnings.

234
00:09:45,646 --> 00:09:46,806
Replace your deprecated API.

235
00:09:47,366 --> 00:09:50,106
Localize your App if

236
00:09:50,106 --> 00:09:51,306
Use accessibility.

237
00:09:52,286 --> 00:09:53,756
Or support accessibility rather.

238
00:09:53,756 --> 00:09:54,706
Get Peek and Pop in there.

239
00:09:54,986 --> 00:09:56,956
And then take a look at

240
00:09:57,186 --> 00:09:58,586
and give us some

241
00:09:59,736 --> 00:10:01,366
With that, let's move

242
00:09:59,736 --> 00:10:01,366
With that, let's move

243
00:10:03,706 --> 00:10:06,436
It's time to move

244
00:10:07,366 --> 00:10:09,726
For you. So, if you still have

245
00:10:09,726 --> 00:10:14,366
like this, go ahead and get them

246
00:10:15,926 --> 00:10:20,396
The approach is you add a

247
00:10:21,036 --> 00:10:24,026
By the way, you don't have

248
00:10:24,026 --> 00:10:26,026
You can have as many catalogs

249
00:10:26,606 --> 00:10:31,646
Maybe you're working on an app

250
00:10:31,836 --> 00:10:34,666
So, you have a catalog for

251
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:36,736
and a second catalog for the

252
00:10:36,866 --> 00:10:37,296
We can do that.

253
00:10:38,296 --> 00:10:41,226
Another example, you might have

254
00:10:41,226 --> 00:10:42,686
Xcode for free from

255
00:10:44,236 --> 00:10:45,636
and create the Asset

256
00:10:46,606 --> 00:10:49,626
And then send it to you or

257
00:10:49,826 --> 00:10:50,416
We could do that too.

258
00:10:51,716 --> 00:10:54,646
When we copy files into an Asset

259
00:10:54,646 --> 00:10:55,256
They are copies.

260
00:10:55,456 --> 00:10:57,426
We don't reference the

261
00:10:57,766 --> 00:10:59,196
So, they do participate

262
00:11:02,436 --> 00:11:05,086
To migrate your project,

263
00:11:05,866 --> 00:11:07,056
Choose Import From Project.

264
00:11:07,456 --> 00:11:10,976
We're going to give you

265
00:11:10,976 --> 00:11:14,286
that are eligible to be

266
00:11:14,286 --> 00:11:15,526
into the Asset Catalog.

267
00:11:18,256 --> 00:11:18,866
There you go.

268
00:11:19,286 --> 00:11:20,736
You migrated your image Assets.

269
00:11:22,016 --> 00:11:25,516
If you previously used

270
00:11:25,876 --> 00:11:28,176
pathForResource etc.,

271
00:11:28,176 --> 00:11:29,496
because once we compile the app,

272
00:11:29,766 --> 00:11:31,286
the images aren't

273
00:11:31,426 --> 00:11:33,626
So you won't find anything.

274
00:11:34,306 --> 00:11:38,556
But if you're using image named,

275
00:11:38,556 --> 00:11:40,676
in an Asset Catalog

276
00:11:40,676 --> 00:11:43,876
if they're just free-floating

277
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:45,446
This API has been

278
00:11:45,646 --> 00:11:48,616
This API Image Name has

279
00:11:48,616 --> 00:11:50,506
and beyond just being

280
00:11:50,506 --> 00:11:51,326
from an image catalog.

281
00:11:52,136 --> 00:11:52,836
Asset Catalog.

282
00:11:53,506 --> 00:11:55,796
For example, it internally

283
00:11:55,796 --> 00:11:57,156
that you asked for

284
00:11:57,326 --> 00:11:58,846
We load it up, we give

285
00:11:58,846 --> 00:12:00,616
The second time you ask

286
00:11:58,846 --> 00:12:00,616
The second time you ask

287
00:12:00,616 --> 00:12:02,436
we just return another

288
00:12:03,366 --> 00:12:06,036
That's not how the

289
00:12:06,186 --> 00:12:08,066
Contents of file loads

290
00:12:08,596 --> 00:12:10,566
So, it's much more perform an,

291
00:12:10,566 --> 00:12:12,406
through a table,

292
00:12:12,856 --> 00:12:16,816
We support multiple

293
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:21,286
So, with image names, you'd

294
00:12:22,206 --> 00:12:24,076
You'd let the framework

295
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:25,496
that you're running on.

296
00:12:26,076 --> 00:12:29,526
Consider the resolution of the

297
00:12:29,526 --> 00:12:30,806
retina on a Plus device.

298
00:12:31,366 --> 00:12:36,036
And possibly other

299
00:12:36,136 --> 00:12:39,196
for the media assets such as the

300
00:12:39,556 --> 00:12:42,736
or the version of Metal that

301
00:12:43,266 --> 00:12:45,866
And you get an image back.

302
00:12:47,286 --> 00:12:49,866
There's two broad kinds

303
00:12:49,866 --> 00:12:50,936
that you can consider.

304
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:52,086
We have scaled images.

305
00:12:52,286 --> 00:12:55,096
Those are like PNG's, JPEG's.

306
00:12:55,096 --> 00:12:58,226
And then we have

307
00:12:58,226 --> 00:13:01,316
or just vector-based

308
00:12:58,226 --> 00:13:01,316
or just vector-based

309
00:13:01,316 --> 00:13:05,476
We treat them a little

310
00:13:06,056 --> 00:13:08,636
On an asset by asset basis,

311
00:13:08,636 --> 00:13:11,066
to be vector-based and that

312
00:13:12,256 --> 00:13:14,156
You do that by specifying

313
00:13:14,726 --> 00:13:18,356
So, I'm going to talk first

314
00:13:18,596 --> 00:13:20,616
and then move onto the

315
00:13:21,346 --> 00:13:24,656
For scaled images, in this

316
00:13:24,656 --> 00:13:26,876
to provide three different

317
00:13:26,876 --> 00:13:30,306
from 1X devices,

318
00:13:31,126 --> 00:13:33,516
If we don't find, because

319
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:37,626
the 2X and 3X, we'll take the 1X

320
00:13:37,626 --> 00:13:40,186
that it becomes, well,

321
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:46,316
on the higher end devices or

322
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:49,746
Likewise, if you just

323
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:51,116
we'd scale it down at runtime.

324
00:13:52,286 --> 00:13:54,416
These two scenarios

325
00:13:54,656 --> 00:13:56,916
In this scenario, if I take

326
00:13:56,916 --> 00:14:00,366
up for an iPhone 6S Plus, it's

327
00:13:56,916 --> 00:14:00,366
up for an iPhone 6S Plus, it's

328
00:14:00,366 --> 00:14:02,186
It's going to have a visual

329
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:04,546
It's not very desirable

330
00:14:04,546 --> 00:14:05,946
your customers aren't

331
00:14:07,496 --> 00:14:09,606
This one, at first

332
00:14:09,606 --> 00:14:11,706
I'll just provide the 3X artwork

333
00:14:12,876 --> 00:14:15,136
But there's a huge problem

334
00:14:15,136 --> 00:14:17,766
down a 3X image, we

335
00:14:18,136 --> 00:14:18,896
And it's really big.

336
00:14:19,746 --> 00:14:23,156
And then we take an

337
00:14:23,156 --> 00:14:25,266
and create a scaled-down

338
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:29,356
It's an order, two orders of

339
00:14:30,466 --> 00:14:31,186
So, consider this.

340
00:14:32,456 --> 00:14:35,536
You're on a device

341
00:14:36,296 --> 00:14:38,026
There's no need for

342
00:14:38,636 --> 00:14:40,086
but you only provide 3X images.

343
00:14:40,846 --> 00:14:42,776
So, we start off with the

344
00:14:43,776 --> 00:14:47,026
That's fine, but then we

345
00:14:47,266 --> 00:14:48,876
down convert it, get

346
00:14:49,056 --> 00:14:50,836
and keep this scaled-down

347
00:14:51,276 --> 00:14:53,186
which just temporarily

348
00:14:53,186 --> 00:14:56,166
And if you're good, it's

349
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:57,236
But if you good, I mean

350
00:14:57,236 --> 00:15:01,556
if you're lucky it's

351
00:14:57,236 --> 00:15:01,556
if you're lucky it's

352
00:15:01,616 --> 00:15:03,466
But let's say you're

353
00:15:03,656 --> 00:15:05,526
and as you're scrolling,

354
00:15:05,846 --> 00:15:07,286
All of a sudden the

355
00:15:07,286 --> 00:15:09,496
for your app balloons

356
00:15:09,496 --> 00:15:10,356
when you use too much memory?

357
00:15:11,086 --> 00:15:13,656
Anybody know, just

358
00:15:13,956 --> 00:15:14,576
Yeah, right.

359
00:15:14,576 --> 00:15:15,616
We terminate it.

360
00:15:15,616 --> 00:15:18,336
It's terminated because you

361
00:15:18,536 --> 00:15:19,696
So, provide the artwork.

362
00:15:20,136 --> 00:15:22,896
In fact, you can do this

363
00:15:23,116 --> 00:15:25,256
not a task but with

364
00:15:25,816 --> 00:15:28,526
You give it a 3X image, let it

365
00:15:28,526 --> 00:15:29,686
Scale it down, give it a name.

366
00:15:29,776 --> 00:15:31,666
Great, throw those all

367
00:15:32,016 --> 00:15:33,776
And if you wanted to, you could,

368
00:15:34,316 --> 00:15:36,986
and this is another

369
00:15:36,986 --> 00:15:38,176
Use this naming convention,

370
00:15:38,586 --> 00:15:41,316
the non-retina ones is

371
00:15:41,316 --> 00:15:44,336
And then add 2X and

372
00:15:45,016 --> 00:15:46,556
And then when you drag

373
00:15:46,556 --> 00:15:49,506
into an Asset Catalog, we

374
00:15:49,506 --> 00:15:51,856
We create one asset with the

375
00:15:52,316 --> 00:15:53,886
as opposed to three

376
00:15:55,096 --> 00:15:57,426
For Vector Assets,

377
00:15:57,426 --> 00:15:59,926
because the file contains a

378
00:15:59,926 --> 00:16:03,366
to draw the image as opposed

379
00:15:59,926 --> 00:16:03,366
to draw the image as opposed

380
00:16:04,246 --> 00:16:06,326
This is the same image, not

381
00:16:06,406 --> 00:16:09,376
Same image scaled

382
00:16:09,546 --> 00:16:10,616
When you specify

383
00:16:10,616 --> 00:16:12,406
to use single vector scaling,

384
00:16:12,476 --> 00:16:14,096
you're providing one

385
00:16:14,276 --> 00:16:16,256
And at build time,

386
00:16:16,256 --> 00:16:17,626
into the different

387
00:16:18,706 --> 00:16:19,866
It's much simpler for you.

388
00:16:19,866 --> 00:16:22,946
This is the kind of thing you'd

389
00:16:22,946 --> 00:16:24,366
and navigation bar images.

390
00:16:25,696 --> 00:16:27,456
There you go, scale

391
00:16:28,516 --> 00:16:30,576
It's also possible

392
00:16:31,826 --> 00:16:36,046
You can set the scale factor

393
00:16:36,546 --> 00:16:38,486
And what you do is you provide

394
00:16:38,486 --> 00:16:40,606
like the limits in

395
00:16:41,686 --> 00:16:43,776
Then, if you want

396
00:16:43,776 --> 00:16:46,476
for the other scale factors,

397
00:16:46,476 --> 00:16:50,836
as either other vector images

398
00:16:52,276 --> 00:16:54,946
Then when we build it, if we see

399
00:16:55,086 --> 00:16:57,756
we'll just rasterize those

400
00:16:57,756 --> 00:17:00,046
in the All truck well or target.

401
00:16:57,756 --> 00:17:00,046
in the All truck well or target.

402
00:17:01,076 --> 00:17:02,846
Otherwise, we'll use the

403
00:17:03,376 --> 00:17:08,376
New in Xcode 8, you can

404
00:17:10,955 --> 00:17:11,616
Come on, you.

405
00:17:12,226 --> 00:17:13,116
You can adjust the compression.

406
00:17:13,496 --> 00:17:15,356
So, we can say for a

407
00:17:15,356 --> 00:17:17,246
to use glossy compression

408
00:17:17,246 --> 00:17:19,046
for a PNG we don't want

409
00:17:19,046 --> 00:17:21,106
because it's going to be

410
00:17:21,185 --> 00:17:22,685
We don't want to see

411
00:17:24,096 --> 00:17:26,195
Another issue you can resolve

412
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:27,896
just in case the pitch

413
00:17:28,546 --> 00:17:31,946
is to fix the issue or

414
00:17:31,946 --> 00:17:35,236
We're referring to

415
00:17:36,596 --> 00:17:39,266
The issue with rounded

416
00:17:39,896 --> 00:17:43,486
So, your button might

417
00:17:43,486 --> 00:17:46,746
that fits perfectly well

418
00:17:46,746 --> 00:17:49,096
in a different language and

419
00:17:49,626 --> 00:17:51,386
And when we change the size

420
00:17:51,386 --> 00:17:54,206
to preserve the beautiful

421
00:17:55,456 --> 00:17:57,206
The way you would even

422
00:17:57,206 --> 00:17:58,596
in the first place is

423
00:17:58,596 --> 00:18:00,346
in Interface Builder

424
00:17:58,596 --> 00:18:00,346
in Interface Builder

425
00:18:00,346 --> 00:18:02,216
and specify a background image.

426
00:18:03,006 --> 00:18:04,356
And then we apply that

427
00:18:04,936 --> 00:18:11,066
In this example, I have an

428
00:18:12,576 --> 00:18:14,766
and I apply that as my

429
00:18:14,766 --> 00:18:16,516
but you can see in the

430
00:18:16,516 --> 00:18:20,066
when it's stretched out it's

431
00:18:22,356 --> 00:18:24,516
So, one way you can

432
00:18:24,516 --> 00:18:25,796
that you've been

433
00:18:25,796 --> 00:18:27,156
which is using Stretchable

434
00:18:28,186 --> 00:18:29,796
And you say well, I want

435
00:18:29,796 --> 00:18:30,756
of pixels on both sides.

436
00:18:32,136 --> 00:18:33,866
And that's fine but

437
00:18:33,866 --> 00:18:36,426
of this presentation is

438
00:18:36,426 --> 00:18:38,616
and rely more on the frameworks

439
00:18:39,586 --> 00:18:42,446
So, instead this is built

440
00:18:42,726 --> 00:18:43,636
It's called Asset Slicer.

441
00:18:44,536 --> 00:18:47,686
And you can use it to

442
00:18:47,686 --> 00:18:49,436
in red, don't stretch these.

443
00:18:50,066 --> 00:18:51,416
Don't distort them.

444
00:18:52,076 --> 00:18:54,986
The portion that's illuminated,

445
00:18:55,996 --> 00:18:58,436
And by doing that, you get

446
00:18:58,436 --> 00:18:59,636
and you don't have to

447
00:19:00,696 --> 00:19:03,006
This is also something you could

448
00:19:03,006 --> 00:19:04,296
because it's part

449
00:19:04,296 --> 00:19:06,966
All right, next up, let's talk

450
00:19:06,966 --> 00:19:09,686
about a design pattern

451
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:13,026
Let's first of all talk about

452
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:16,206
or trying to change

453
00:19:16,406 --> 00:19:18,736
So, we have UITextField and

454
00:19:18,736 --> 00:19:21,096
and the delegate is called

455
00:19:21,226 --> 00:19:23,336
Fine. And in it, it

456
00:19:23,336 --> 00:19:25,506
to text fields, like

457
00:19:26,266 --> 00:19:30,046
Okay? We have WCSession.

458
00:19:30,516 --> 00:19:31,636
And WCSession delegate.

459
00:19:31,636 --> 00:19:32,456
What's inside the delegate?

460
00:19:32,566 --> 00:19:34,126
Methods that relate

461
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:35,636
You can see the pattern here.

462
00:19:36,146 --> 00:19:38,716
Which we break with this one.

463
00:19:39,356 --> 00:19:43,036
We have the app delegate

464
00:19:43,036 --> 00:19:44,676
that relate to the

465
00:19:45,346 --> 00:19:48,706
But then we stick other stuff

466
00:19:48,706 --> 00:19:50,826
and essentially eventually

467
00:19:50,826 --> 00:19:53,096
in there including the

468
00:19:53,366 --> 00:19:56,196
And we do it because it's

469
00:19:56,576 --> 00:19:58,446
through the Application

470
00:19:58,446 --> 00:19:59,756
cast it and retrieve it.

471
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:03,486
But it's such a strong coupling

472
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:03,486
But it's such a strong coupling

473
00:20:03,826 --> 00:20:06,466
and your app delegate and your

474
00:20:06,466 --> 00:20:07,796
to be the place where that goes.

475
00:20:08,286 --> 00:20:11,726
Instead of a pattern like this

476
00:20:12,026 --> 00:20:13,456
where each view controller

477
00:20:13,456 --> 00:20:15,276
to some common object,

478
00:20:15,276 --> 00:20:17,756
in your app delegate,

479
00:20:19,136 --> 00:20:21,936
Using Dependency Injection,

480
00:20:22,186 --> 00:20:24,246
that one view controller

481
00:20:24,246 --> 00:20:25,696
to the next view

482
00:20:25,696 --> 00:20:26,916
that view controller

483
00:20:27,556 --> 00:20:29,706
The idea is you give the

484
00:20:29,706 --> 00:20:31,776
that it needs to do its job.

485
00:20:33,716 --> 00:20:36,396
So, for mail, you'd have

486
00:20:36,966 --> 00:20:38,176
A view controller

487
00:20:38,176 --> 00:20:40,566
of mailboxes would have a model

488
00:20:40,566 --> 00:20:41,406
of mailboxes.

489
00:20:41,796 --> 00:20:43,466
You tap on one of the mailboxes.

490
00:20:43,906 --> 00:20:46,716
Another view controller's

491
00:20:46,716 --> 00:20:48,226
to show the messages

492
00:20:48,786 --> 00:20:49,276
The middle one.

493
00:20:49,536 --> 00:20:51,936
And you pass forward the one

494
00:20:51,936 --> 00:20:52,936
and you keep passing it forward.

495
00:20:53,496 --> 00:20:58,646
The way you would do that in

496
00:20:58,646 --> 00:21:00,006
for segue and pass

497
00:20:58,646 --> 00:21:00,006
for segue and pass

498
00:21:00,556 --> 00:21:02,176
The way you would do it

499
00:21:02,176 --> 00:21:04,806
if you were programmatically

500
00:21:04,806 --> 00:21:06,576
for the button viewed

501
00:21:06,576 --> 00:21:08,886
The view controller,

502
00:21:10,496 --> 00:21:14,556
The benefit of this technique

503
00:21:14,556 --> 00:21:15,706
standalone now.

504
00:21:15,706 --> 00:21:17,826
They don't have these strong

505
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:19,176
You can reuse them more.

506
00:21:23,036 --> 00:21:24,856
Coming back, you've

507
00:21:25,236 --> 00:21:27,946
You can do what we do, which

508
00:21:27,946 --> 00:21:30,346
and have you implement it

509
00:21:30,346 --> 00:21:31,546
to say the view controller's

510
00:21:31,546 --> 00:21:32,906
and maybe update

511
00:21:33,046 --> 00:21:34,346
You can pass in a closure.

512
00:21:34,796 --> 00:21:36,976
You can pass object

513
00:21:37,336 --> 00:21:40,236
Or, you can, if you're

514
00:21:40,236 --> 00:21:42,446
it's exactly the same as

515
00:21:42,446 --> 00:21:43,936
because it happens in both ways,

516
00:21:44,126 --> 00:21:45,556
forward directions

517
00:21:46,996 --> 00:21:49,526
Another reason why

518
00:21:49,526 --> 00:21:51,986
because view controllers are

519
00:21:52,876 --> 00:21:55,486
They should be able to be

520
00:21:55,486 --> 00:21:57,436
of each other to

521
00:21:57,786 --> 00:22:01,826
In this case, an iPhone SE's

522
00:21:57,786 --> 00:22:01,826
In this case, an iPhone SE's

523
00:22:01,826 --> 00:22:03,716
to be different for your

524
00:22:03,716 --> 00:22:07,136
on an iPad 12 inch,

525
00:22:08,126 --> 00:22:09,646
If your view controllers

526
00:22:09,646 --> 00:22:12,236
it's easy to do that.

527
00:22:12,236 --> 00:22:12,556
All right.

528
00:22:13,076 --> 00:22:17,266
Now, last year at WWDC,

529
00:22:17,766 --> 00:22:22,436
on topics including playgrounds

530
00:22:23,516 --> 00:22:26,426
And interoperability with

531
00:22:26,996 --> 00:22:31,426
And since then, we've added

532
00:22:31,626 --> 00:22:32,886
things that we couldn't

533
00:22:32,886 --> 00:22:34,706
So, I want to show you

534
00:22:35,376 --> 00:22:39,166
With that, we're going

535
00:22:39,536 --> 00:22:42,416
So, this is the periodic

536
00:22:42,416 --> 00:22:43,296
that I showed you last year.

537
00:22:43,506 --> 00:22:45,366
Since then, it's been

538
00:22:45,366 --> 00:22:49,196
For example, the colors

539
00:22:49,346 --> 00:22:51,786
Instead of using states

540
00:22:51,786 --> 00:22:55,166
now it's the kind of object

541
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:57,436
halogen, that kind of thing.

542
00:22:57,436 --> 00:22:59,006
We've also added

543
00:22:59,006 --> 00:23:01,826
out so it actually looks like

544
00:22:59,006 --> 00:23:01,826
out so it actually looks like

545
00:23:02,136 --> 00:23:04,146
and that's a collection

546
00:23:06,056 --> 00:23:13,426
I want to show you

547
00:23:13,636 --> 00:23:15,476
One of the things that

548
00:23:15,476 --> 00:23:17,656
since the last time

549
00:23:17,656 --> 00:23:19,796
that the data model has

550
00:23:20,756 --> 00:23:24,566
So now I have a class the

551
00:23:24,866 --> 00:23:26,526
like nitrogen or oxygen.

552
00:23:27,206 --> 00:23:29,796
And I have a class that

553
00:23:30,266 --> 00:23:33,056
of those called, excuse

554
00:23:34,356 --> 00:23:37,456
This class instantiates

555
00:23:37,456 --> 00:23:40,636
the individual atomic elements,

556
00:23:41,556 --> 00:23:43,826
Which I've also stored

557
00:23:44,396 --> 00:23:48,376
But now that I've moved

558
00:23:48,746 --> 00:23:50,596
I can show you the data

559
00:23:51,176 --> 00:23:53,326
Last year when I did

560
00:23:53,326 --> 00:23:54,646
to make a new playground first.

561
00:23:55,566 --> 00:23:56,736
New file, playground.

562
00:23:57,576 --> 00:24:01,836
Last year when I did

563
00:23:57,576 --> 00:24:01,836
Last year when I did

564
00:24:01,836 --> 00:24:04,616
pasting between my

565
00:24:05,186 --> 00:24:08,976
And when you do this a lot, your

566
00:24:08,976 --> 00:24:09,976
with a lot of code in it.

567
00:24:09,976 --> 00:24:13,136
So, instead our playgrounds

568
00:24:14,206 --> 00:24:15,816
for source code and resources.

569
00:24:16,366 --> 00:24:20,996
I can take my model

570
00:24:20,996 --> 00:24:22,006
into the sources folder.

571
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:26,196
And then we compile

572
00:24:26,746 --> 00:24:29,386
and we implicitly import

573
00:24:29,386 --> 00:24:31,976
into the playground to make

574
00:24:33,556 --> 00:24:37,796
Which means if I take this

575
00:24:37,846 --> 00:24:39,666
and include that in

576
00:24:39,906 --> 00:24:41,726
which makes it accessible

577
00:24:42,336 --> 00:24:48,486
I can come over to

578
00:24:48,486 --> 00:24:51,806
and instantiate an instance

579
00:24:53,086 --> 00:24:54,036
Here's Californium.

580
00:24:54,906 --> 00:24:57,236
Like that.

581
00:24:58,416 --> 00:25:01,676
So, the ability to

582
00:24:58,416 --> 00:25:01,676
So, the ability to

583
00:25:02,086 --> 00:25:04,956
and have them automatically

584
00:25:05,636 --> 00:25:07,076
when they're in the

585
00:25:07,076 --> 00:25:09,756
or the resources folder is a

586
00:25:10,186 --> 00:25:12,336
to keep your playgrounds

587
00:25:12,336 --> 00:25:16,666
and concise while also having

588
00:25:16,866 --> 00:25:18,816
Now, above and beyond that,

589
00:25:18,816 --> 00:25:23,926
since last year that affects

590
00:25:24,306 --> 00:25:27,056
The International Union of Pure

591
00:25:27,056 --> 00:25:31,056
and Applied Chemistry

592
00:25:31,056 --> 00:25:32,846
of 4 additional elements.

593
00:25:33,736 --> 00:25:35,606
So, now all of a sudden

594
00:25:35,606 --> 00:25:37,516
that I've got embedded

595
00:25:37,516 --> 00:25:38,836
like such good idea anymore.

596
00:25:39,436 --> 00:25:42,756
So, I thought well,

597
00:25:42,756 --> 00:25:43,676
We'll just put it online.

598
00:25:44,896 --> 00:25:48,746
So I set up a little Web

599
00:25:48,746 --> 00:25:49,946
at this time with

600
00:25:51,186 --> 00:25:53,746
And then the idea is that

601
00:25:54,266 --> 00:25:56,576
initially it'll use the

602
00:25:57,246 --> 00:25:58,956
That way if there's no

603
00:25:58,956 --> 00:26:00,556
there's still something

604
00:25:58,956 --> 00:26:00,556
there's still something

605
00:26:00,556 --> 00:26:03,716
And this is also a pattern

606
00:26:04,676 --> 00:26:06,286
Then we'll do a background

607
00:26:06,666 --> 00:26:07,936
and in the background

608
00:26:07,936 --> 00:26:09,326
if there's an update

609
00:26:09,326 --> 00:26:10,906
And if so, we'll put

610
00:26:10,906 --> 00:26:13,726
and we'll reference

611
00:26:14,496 --> 00:26:16,576
So, I want to do the network

612
00:26:17,196 --> 00:26:21,416
And for that, we have the class

613
00:26:21,416 --> 00:26:23,196
and now known as URL Session.

614
00:26:24,056 --> 00:26:26,346
Which is shown here.

615
00:26:26,956 --> 00:26:32,356
We grabbed the Session and the

616
00:26:32,356 --> 00:26:35,136
when I call it out on line 24,

617
00:26:36,326 --> 00:26:37,936
is I give it a completion

618
00:26:38,666 --> 00:26:40,676
Because this runs asynchronously

619
00:26:41,426 --> 00:26:43,586
Go to the Network Request,

620
00:26:44,826 --> 00:26:48,996
When the request either times

621
00:26:48,996 --> 00:26:50,766
it gives us call back.

622
00:26:50,766 --> 00:26:52,486
And in the call back on line 28,

623
00:26:53,646 --> 00:26:55,976
you can see I'm printing

624
00:26:56,526 --> 00:27:01,176
But you actually don't

625
00:26:56,526 --> 00:27:01,176
But you actually don't

626
00:27:02,356 --> 00:27:02,976
That's a problem.

627
00:27:08,756 --> 00:27:10,336
So, just think about

628
00:27:10,956 --> 00:27:11,966
We have a playground

629
00:27:12,506 --> 00:27:14,146
We asked it to do a

630
00:27:14,806 --> 00:27:16,816
At some indeterminate

631
00:27:17,316 --> 00:27:19,546
we get a call back saying

632
00:27:20,006 --> 00:27:22,206
But playgrounds typically

633
00:27:22,256 --> 00:27:23,486
The first line all the way

634
00:27:23,486 --> 00:27:24,846
through to the end

635
00:27:26,116 --> 00:27:27,156
Key word being typically.

636
00:27:27,156 --> 00:27:28,366
But they don't have to.

637
00:27:28,916 --> 00:27:31,546
We can get a runloop and

638
00:27:31,546 --> 00:27:32,336
in our playgrounds.

639
00:27:33,316 --> 00:27:35,416
To do that we import

640
00:27:35,656 --> 00:27:36,306
playground support.

641
00:27:37,426 --> 00:27:42,826
And then you ask the playground

642
00:27:42,826 --> 00:27:45,896
And then it never stops,

643
00:27:46,466 --> 00:27:49,706
So, now if I scroll

644
00:27:49,706 --> 00:27:52,506
you can see I'm getting

645
00:27:53,196 --> 00:27:53,856
There's cadmium.

646
00:27:53,946 --> 00:27:54,486
All right.

647
00:27:57,076 --> 00:28:02,426
Next I want to expand

648
00:27:57,076 --> 00:28:02,426
Next I want to expand

649
00:28:02,516 --> 00:28:04,636
Last I showed a drawing,

650
00:28:04,636 --> 00:28:07,846
a rounded corner

651
00:28:08,956 --> 00:28:10,776
This time I don't just want to

652
00:28:10,776 --> 00:28:13,276
I want to do a whole table view

653
00:28:13,746 --> 00:28:17,476
And we have some new features

654
00:28:17,476 --> 00:28:19,166
in the playgrounds

655
00:28:19,896 --> 00:28:24,366
Let me just open up

656
00:28:25,076 --> 00:28:27,716
Call it View.

657
00:28:28,286 --> 00:28:33,406
So, I'm going to make a subclass

658
00:28:34,986 --> 00:28:40,826
This is all that it

659
00:28:41,106 --> 00:28:43,086
I'm implementing the 2

660
00:28:43,086 --> 00:28:44,896
or Table View Controller

661
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:49,036
Number of objects, sorry,

662
00:28:49,296 --> 00:28:51,996
self-wrote index that and

663
00:28:52,526 --> 00:28:55,146
And I'd like to see that live.

664
00:28:56,356 --> 00:28:59,696
So, this time what we do is we

665
00:29:00,626 --> 00:29:02,896
and then using that

666
00:29:03,066 --> 00:29:06,066
that I've already imported, the

667
00:29:06,706 --> 00:29:11,416
I grab the playground's

668
00:29:12,006 --> 00:29:16,956
And then we take that

669
00:29:16,956 --> 00:29:19,746
into the assistant editor who's

670
00:29:20,836 --> 00:29:22,226
but rather our Live View.

671
00:29:29,446 --> 00:29:31,076
See? It's a Live Table View.

672
00:29:31,556 --> 00:29:32,926
It scrolls, it's active.

Thank you.

Is not just a static image.

676
00:29:39,296 --> 00:29:40,436
It's a real interactive

677
00:29:40,436 --> 00:29:42,946
If you wanted to try some

678
00:29:42,946 --> 00:29:44,836
or even the existent delegate

679
00:29:44,836 --> 00:29:46,366
into the playground and

680
00:29:46,856 --> 00:29:50,476
No need to put this into

681
00:29:51,746 --> 00:29:53,476
So, now I want to take the two

682
00:29:54,606 --> 00:29:57,016
Specifically, I have this

683
00:29:57,016 --> 00:29:57,636
that's happening.

684
00:29:58,046 --> 00:30:00,606
And after I retrieve the data,

685
00:29:58,046 --> 00:30:00,606
And after I retrieve the data,

686
00:30:00,806 --> 00:30:09,226
So, let me show you that.

687
00:30:09,396 --> 00:30:11,386
First of all, comment this.

688
00:30:12,046 --> 00:30:15,386
And just to prove to you that

689
00:30:15,446 --> 00:30:19,216
from that site, I'm

690
00:30:19,686 --> 00:30:21,796
so I have an empty

691
00:30:21,796 --> 00:30:22,506
All right.

692
00:30:26,556 --> 00:30:28,916
So, I have an empty

693
00:30:28,916 --> 00:30:30,066
I do the network request.

694
00:30:30,836 --> 00:30:32,126
When the network

695
00:30:32,126 --> 00:30:35,006
and it's call back, it's a sign.

696
00:30:35,566 --> 00:30:37,946
The new array of elements

697
00:30:38,546 --> 00:30:39,516
And then we reload

698
00:30:40,096 --> 00:30:41,926
All right.

699
00:30:51,126 --> 00:30:51,856
Is that what you would expect?

700
00:30:51,856 --> 00:30:54,546
It's not what I expected the

701
00:30:55,036 --> 00:30:56,256
Oh, that must be a bug in Xcode.

702
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:58,066
I'll just go file a bug

703
00:30:58,066 --> 00:30:59,496
But it's actually not.

704
00:31:00,986 --> 00:31:03,186
It's a bug in my code,

705
00:31:03,426 --> 00:31:06,006
It's a bug in my code and

706
00:31:06,976 --> 00:31:09,706
We have this background

707
00:31:10,526 --> 00:31:12,516
The background operation

708
00:31:12,766 --> 00:31:13,576
It's not on the main thread.

709
00:31:14,246 --> 00:31:15,236
UI is in the main thread.

710
00:31:16,096 --> 00:31:19,926
So, in my closure, the

711
00:31:19,926 --> 00:31:21,716
I can't be updating the

712
00:31:22,136 --> 00:31:25,206
which is what I'm trying to do

713
00:31:26,536 --> 00:31:31,136
When I tap on the cells,

714
00:31:31,136 --> 00:31:32,266
and that's why they do refresh

715
00:31:32,266 --> 00:31:36,086
and you can see them

716
00:31:36,296 --> 00:31:37,476
This is also something

717
00:31:37,476 --> 00:31:40,316
We have something new in

718
00:31:40,596 --> 00:31:42,096
for Grand Central Dispatch.

719
00:31:43,936 --> 00:31:47,776
So, instead of that

720
00:31:48,386 --> 00:31:53,266
I can now say a dispatch

721
00:31:53,546 --> 00:31:54,376
What kind of operation?

722
00:31:54,376 --> 00:31:55,296
An asynchronous one.

723
00:31:55,726 --> 00:31:56,556
We don't need that anymore.

724
00:31:57,186 --> 00:31:58,776
And here's what I wanted

725
00:31:58,776 --> 00:32:04,176
Now it bounces back to the

726
00:31:58,776 --> 00:32:04,176
Now it bounces back to the

Thank you.

732
00:32:21,746 --> 00:32:24,546
So, just as a point of

733
00:32:24,546 --> 00:32:27,066
from the previous presentation,

734
00:32:27,616 --> 00:32:30,266
Some other tips.

735
00:32:30,746 --> 00:32:32,876
When I dragged those files

736
00:32:32,876 --> 00:32:34,576
or the resources

737
00:32:34,636 --> 00:32:37,176
They are not referenced.

738
00:32:37,176 --> 00:32:40,796
Also, only methods that are

739
00:32:40,796 --> 00:32:42,316
properties, and datatypes,

740
00:32:42,316 --> 00:32:43,706
as public are going

741
00:32:44,036 --> 00:32:44,976
to you in the playground.

742
00:32:44,976 --> 00:32:46,866
So, you might have to go

743
00:32:46,866 --> 00:32:48,716
because the default

744
00:32:48,716 --> 00:32:50,676
in Swift is internal,

745
00:32:53,256 --> 00:32:55,586
I mentioned using

00:32:56,626 --> 00:32:58,816

that are constrained

749
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:03,706
And those customers try

750
00:33:03,706 --> 00:33:05,116
of the operating

751
00:33:05,116 --> 00:33:06,226
out there's not enough space.

00:33:07,116 --> 00:33:08,876
So, what we do when that

753
00:33:08,876 --> 00:33:11,576
under storage pressure, is we

754
00:33:11,576 --> 00:33:12,876
and we delete everything

755
00:33:12,876 --> 00:33:14,436
in all the applications

756
00:33:14,696 --> 00:33:15,966
This way we free up space.

757
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:18,326
We need your help with this.

758
00:33:18,456 --> 00:33:20,376
If you are temporarily

759
00:33:20,376 --> 00:33:22,346
and you're not putting

760
00:33:22,656 --> 00:33:23,766
put it in the caches folder.

761
00:33:24,246 --> 00:33:29,756
Next. I thought it'd

762
00:33:30,416 --> 00:33:33,826
it's doing that again.

763
00:33:34,466 --> 00:33:39,336
To take the view controllers

764
00:33:39,336 --> 00:33:42,536
and rearrange them in a way that

765
00:33:43,166 --> 00:33:45,696
So, I'm going switch

766
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:49,526
Turn on my Bluetooth.

767
00:33:55,396 --> 00:33:58,866
And take the view controllers

768
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:19,516
Well, there we go.

769
00:34:19,746 --> 00:34:21,856
I have paired my

770
00:34:21,856 --> 00:34:23,275
so I can use it with

771
00:34:24,806 --> 00:34:27,255
It's exactly the same code

772
00:34:27,255 --> 00:34:29,036
same table view, all

773
00:34:29,746 --> 00:34:35,275
I can go over and I can see

774
00:34:35,516 --> 00:34:38,025
And I get that neat TV effect

775
00:34:38,025 --> 00:34:38,826
and its collection view.

776
00:34:39,315 --> 00:34:40,485
It's the same layout code.

777
00:34:40,485 --> 00:34:41,545
It's the same view controller.

778
00:34:41,545 --> 00:34:43,246
It's all the same as

779
00:34:44,686 --> 00:34:47,156
Well, almost.

780
00:34:55,956 --> 00:34:57,506
I added this line

781
00:34:57,506 --> 00:34:59,746
when I selected a

782
00:34:59,746 --> 00:35:02,006
you would get that focused item.

783
00:34:59,746 --> 00:35:02,006
you would get that focused item.

784
00:35:02,706 --> 00:35:05,846
And I used the OS

785
00:35:06,196 --> 00:35:07,596
to say this is only for tvOS.

786
00:35:08,396 --> 00:35:09,416
Other than that,

787
00:35:10,286 --> 00:35:11,606
Which kind of brings

788
00:35:11,606 --> 00:35:14,956
that if you ever think you are

789
00:35:14,956 --> 00:35:16,466
and just dropping it

790
00:35:16,916 --> 00:35:18,536
with no real other changes,

791
00:35:18,536 --> 00:35:21,516
you're possibly doing something

792
00:35:21,516 --> 00:35:23,216
out the human interface

793
00:35:23,216 --> 00:35:25,456
to see how you can make

794
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:30,666
on that platform more native and

795
00:35:31,286 --> 00:35:34,546
Let me give you an example.

796
00:35:34,546 --> 00:35:36,776
Let's say that you made

797
00:35:36,776 --> 00:35:38,006
of like cloud-based accounting.

798
00:35:38,756 --> 00:35:41,726
And maybe you have an iPad

799
00:35:41,726 --> 00:35:42,806
people fill out invoices.

800
00:35:43,546 --> 00:35:44,726
Makes sense.

801
00:35:45,646 --> 00:35:48,566
It makes no sense,

802
00:35:49,446 --> 00:35:52,426
to fill out invoices

803
00:35:52,456 --> 00:35:53,746
You just wouldn't do it.

804
00:35:53,746 --> 00:35:54,386
Why would you do that?

805
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:56,816
This is not an app you

806
00:35:56,816 --> 00:35:58,656
and launch it on tvOS.

807
00:35:59,286 --> 00:36:02,646
But, the iPad version of your

808
00:35:59,286 --> 00:36:02,646
But, the iPad version of your

809
00:36:02,646 --> 00:36:04,646
visualization about how

810
00:36:04,646 --> 00:36:06,256
Maybe you've got some

811
00:36:07,516 --> 00:36:08,786
Those would be awesome on a TV.

812
00:36:09,076 --> 00:36:13,876
You could have a version of your

813
00:36:13,876 --> 00:36:14,886
of how the company's doing.

814
00:36:15,306 --> 00:36:17,716
And maybe in the company's

815
00:36:17,716 --> 00:36:19,666
on and it just animates

816
00:36:19,826 --> 00:36:21,016
It's the same data model.

817
00:36:21,116 --> 00:36:22,436
It's the same data access.

818
00:36:22,926 --> 00:36:24,606
But you pivoted that

819
00:36:24,606 --> 00:36:26,856
that makes it more

820
00:36:26,856 --> 00:36:27,516
in which it's running.

821
00:36:27,696 --> 00:36:29,236
And that's an idea I

822
00:36:29,236 --> 00:36:31,246
How can we take the same data

823
00:36:31,466 --> 00:36:36,606
in a way that works

824
00:36:36,606 --> 00:36:40,606
In summary, modernizing your

825
00:36:40,606 --> 00:36:42,876
We want you to rely on the

826
00:36:44,156 --> 00:36:46,286
If you can get rid of

827
00:36:46,286 --> 00:36:48,376
and instead use code that

828
00:36:48,376 --> 00:36:49,746
that's code let's code

829
00:36:50,476 --> 00:36:51,166
We'd like you to do that.

830
00:36:52,166 --> 00:36:54,676
We want you to get started today

831
00:36:54,676 --> 00:36:56,156
with the Swift converter.

832
00:36:56,826 --> 00:36:58,566
We want you to architect

833
00:36:58,566 --> 00:37:00,776
with fewer inter-object

834
00:36:58,566 --> 00:37:00,776
with fewer inter-object

835
00:37:00,776 --> 00:37:03,206
for you to rearrange your app.

836
00:37:04,496 --> 00:37:07,226
Finally, we want you to

837
00:37:07,226 --> 00:37:09,696
to other platforms

838
00:37:14,436 --> 00:37:15,406
by pivoting your data model.

839
00:37:16,276 --> 00:37:18,216
There are some related

840
00:37:18,856 --> 00:37:19,426
There you go.

841
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:25,426
And other than that, you

842
00:37:25,426 --> 00:37:26,526
for this particular session.

843
00:37:26,776 --> 00:37:28,006
And that is it for me.

844
00:37:28,256 --> 00:37:28,866
Thanks, everyone.
