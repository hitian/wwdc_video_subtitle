00:00:34,046 --> 00:00:35,826
&gt;&gt; Hi, my name is Daphne Larose.

4
00:00:35,826 --> 00:00:37,696
I'm a software engineer

5
00:00:38,186 --> 00:00:39,066
Welcome to my talk.

6
00:00:39,476 --> 00:00:41,466
Thanks to those of you

7
00:00:41,466 --> 00:00:44,896
I know it's kind

8
00:00:45,096 --> 00:00:47,676
So, I wanted to start

9
00:00:47,676 --> 00:00:49,906
that we commonly

10
00:00:50,656 --> 00:00:52,356
The first thing that comes

11
00:00:52,356 --> 00:00:54,036
about you, are converter apps.

12
00:00:54,516 --> 00:00:56,856
Makes sense, convert

13
00:00:57,796 --> 00:01:00,216
But I wonder though,

14
00:00:57,796 --> 00:01:00,216
But I wonder though,

15
00:01:00,566 --> 00:01:03,276
that also use measurements but

16
00:01:04,965 --> 00:01:09,296
I don't know, but when I think

17
00:01:09,296 --> 00:01:12,706
it's interesting, right, because

18
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:15,296
We just don't normally think

19
00:01:15,456 --> 00:01:17,846
and they can pop up in

20
00:01:18,276 --> 00:01:21,476
one of those ways being when

21
00:01:21,506 --> 00:01:24,446
that are common for whatever

22
00:01:24,966 --> 00:01:28,466
So, let's say I'm in

23
00:01:28,946 --> 00:01:30,626
that is calculating

24
00:01:31,246 --> 00:01:34,746
and I expect the measurement to

25
00:01:35,396 --> 00:01:36,956
but they show up

26
00:01:37,126 --> 00:01:37,826
It's like, hmm.

27
00:01:38,406 --> 00:01:41,746
It makes for kind of a jarring,

28
00:01:42,706 --> 00:01:45,946
And so in this talk, we're going

29
00:01:45,946 --> 00:01:48,316
of APIs that helps you ensure

30
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:51,106
that this never happens

31
00:01:52,416 --> 00:01:54,906
So, if we think again about

32
00:01:54,956 --> 00:01:57,296
other apps that we

33
00:01:57,486 --> 00:01:59,926
I had mentioned converter

34
00:02:00,586 --> 00:02:03,036
But another example

35
00:02:03,906 --> 00:02:08,186
So, today we're talking about

36
00:02:08,226 --> 00:02:10,596
It's called Jammin' in

37
00:02:10,645 --> 00:02:12,726
because z's are cool, and

38
00:02:13,806 --> 00:02:16,266
So, the premise of the game is

39
00:02:16,266 --> 00:02:18,056
to dance from level to level.

40
00:02:18,636 --> 00:02:22,156
I have some pretty set

41
00:02:22,466 --> 00:02:24,916
One, I need this

42
00:02:24,996 --> 00:02:27,076
Like, the most fun a

43
00:02:27,706 --> 00:02:30,976
Two, tons of emoji,

44
00:02:31,716 --> 00:02:34,406
Three, it needs to be

45
00:02:34,406 --> 00:02:35,146
I want it everywhere.

46
00:02:35,846 --> 00:02:39,296
So, when we think

47
00:02:39,296 --> 00:02:40,896
that this game would

48
00:02:41,516 --> 00:02:43,676
every round would be

49
00:02:44,346 --> 00:02:47,686
and within this jam session,

50
00:02:47,686 --> 00:02:51,446
of time that it takes our player

51
00:02:51,996 --> 00:02:53,766
the distance that

52
00:02:53,836 --> 00:02:55,996
the number of dance

53
00:02:56,456 --> 00:02:59,256
and maybe even, like, the rate

54
00:02:59,256 --> 00:03:04,516
But let's think about the things

55
00:02:59,256 --> 00:03:04,516
But let's think about the things

56
00:03:05,376 --> 00:03:06,186
Notice anything?

57
00:03:06,906 --> 00:03:07,846
They're all measureable.

58
00:03:07,906 --> 00:03:10,116
They're quantifiable

59
00:03:10,526 --> 00:03:14,036
And so, if we were stop

60
00:03:14,556 --> 00:03:16,326
whip out a computer,

61
00:03:17,226 --> 00:03:18,376
how would we represent this?

62
00:03:19,356 --> 00:03:21,856
Well, we could represent

63
00:03:22,586 --> 00:03:23,086
That's true.

64
00:03:24,076 --> 00:03:27,586
Easy. The problem with that

65
00:03:27,586 --> 00:03:29,366
some context when we do that.

66
00:03:29,986 --> 00:03:31,236
And so let's look at an example.

67
00:03:32,806 --> 00:03:33,876
So we have our little player.

68
00:03:34,156 --> 00:03:36,026
I told you, lots of

69
00:03:37,016 --> 00:03:39,886
And our little player has

70
00:03:40,556 --> 00:03:42,686
and they've moonwalked

71
00:03:43,326 --> 00:03:48,906
Now, if we stored this distance

72
00:03:48,906 --> 00:03:51,146
but what does five

73
00:03:51,516 --> 00:03:53,566
It brings up this

74
00:03:54,836 --> 00:03:57,286
But if we say five feet,

75
00:03:57,336 --> 00:03:58,616
This actually makes sense.

76
00:03:58,806 --> 00:04:00,706
It now has context

77
00:03:58,806 --> 00:04:00,706
It now has context

78
00:04:02,206 --> 00:04:06,616
And so now, let's talk

79
00:04:06,616 --> 00:04:08,896
or the API that Foundation

80
00:04:08,896 --> 00:04:11,486
to accurately represent

81
00:04:11,636 --> 00:04:13,626
So, you have a new struct.

82
00:04:14,306 --> 00:04:16,366
It's called Measurement, and

83
00:04:16,366 --> 00:04:19,185
and we'll get into what a

84
00:04:20,745 --> 00:04:24,846
Contains a unit as well as

85
00:04:25,956 --> 00:04:29,626
So, what's cool about this is

86
00:04:29,626 --> 00:04:33,346
to represent a measurement

87
00:04:33,966 --> 00:04:36,696
And so if we go back

88
00:04:37,336 --> 00:04:39,646
let's say in the game we

89
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:42,466
of distance traveled, but

90
00:04:42,466 --> 00:04:44,406
of the distance that the

91
00:04:45,116 --> 00:04:47,876
How would we do this

92
00:04:48,816 --> 00:04:51,046
Well, now we can

93
00:04:51,126 --> 00:04:52,916
as a measurement of five feet.

94
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:55,936
We could also represent

95
00:04:56,266 --> 00:04:58,436
as a measurement of,

96
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:02,126
And so now, you can actually

97
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:02,126
And so now, you can actually

98
00:05:02,126 --> 00:05:02,496
with them.

99
00:05:02,976 --> 00:05:05,216
You can add them together

100
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:08,126
which is a measurement

101
00:05:09,586 --> 00:05:12,446
You can multiply them

102
00:05:12,526 --> 00:05:13,636
the value that you expect.

103
00:05:14,506 --> 00:05:16,016
You could also divide them,

104
00:05:17,196 --> 00:05:19,436
and get a similar

105
00:05:19,436 --> 00:05:23,106
So if we go back to

106
00:05:24,406 --> 00:05:27,946
what are some things that we

107
00:05:29,056 --> 00:05:35,516
Well, first off, every unit

108
00:05:35,716 --> 00:05:39,866
Units can have a dimension, and

109
00:05:39,866 --> 00:05:43,186
for the dimension length.

110
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:46,936
It could use, like, feet

111
00:05:47,366 --> 00:05:51,706
Units could also be

112
00:05:51,796 --> 00:05:55,366
so one foot could be equivalent

113
00:05:56,086 --> 00:05:58,296
And so now we have APIs

114
00:05:58,296 --> 00:06:00,526
to actually represent

115
00:05:58,296 --> 00:06:00,526
to actually represent

116
00:06:01,496 --> 00:06:04,726
Now, if you're paying close

117
00:06:04,726 --> 00:06:06,446
that every unit has a symbol,

118
00:06:06,696 --> 00:06:10,416
and so in this API we're

119
00:06:11,016 --> 00:06:13,346
We don't necessarily

120
00:06:13,346 --> 00:06:16,506
or the equivalents because not

121
00:06:16,506 --> 00:06:19,356
to another one, and not

122
00:06:20,006 --> 00:06:22,416
But at the very least,

123
00:06:22,486 --> 00:06:23,596
so we're representing that here.

124
00:06:24,556 --> 00:06:26,026
But if we go back

125
00:06:26,026 --> 00:06:28,296
of a dimension, what

126
00:06:28,296 --> 00:06:29,276
What does that actually mean?

127
00:06:30,206 --> 00:06:33,726
Well, dimensions are categories

128
00:06:34,066 --> 00:06:35,186
with different kinds of units.

129
00:06:35,556 --> 00:06:37,456
So, when we think of

130
00:06:38,296 --> 00:06:40,436
length can be represented

131
00:06:40,496 --> 00:06:44,376
feet, miles, what have you.

132
00:06:44,576 --> 00:06:47,236
Dimensions also always have

133
00:06:47,236 --> 00:06:50,226
to the length example, the

134
00:06:50,306 --> 00:06:54,356
You can also perform

135
00:06:54,356 --> 00:06:55,446
within a single dimension.

136
00:06:55,446 --> 00:06:58,176
So you can convert

137
00:06:58,466 --> 00:07:00,246
meters to miles, et cetera.

138
00:06:58,466 --> 00:07:00,246
meters to miles, et cetera.

139
00:07:00,846 --> 00:07:05,926
So now we have API to represent

140
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:07,356
that dimension subclass is Unit,

141
00:07:07,776 --> 00:07:11,076
which means that it inherently

142
00:07:12,776 --> 00:07:14,266
We have a converter property,

143
00:07:14,366 --> 00:07:17,376
and I'll go into what a unit

144
00:07:17,436 --> 00:07:20,486
but essentially it defines

145
00:07:20,486 --> 00:07:21,686
and from its base unit.

146
00:07:21,686 --> 00:07:24,476
We have an initializer,

147
00:07:24,476 --> 00:07:27,886
and a converter instance,

148
00:07:27,886 --> 00:07:29,236
every dimension has a base unit.

149
00:07:29,236 --> 00:07:30,456
So now we have a class property

150
00:07:30,836 --> 00:07:32,226
that will return

151
00:07:33,006 --> 00:07:34,636
The important thing to

152
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:37,576
is that every instance

153
00:07:37,746 --> 00:07:40,566
in and of itself a unit.

154
00:07:40,686 --> 00:07:42,936
Now, with this new API

155
00:07:42,936 --> 00:07:46,176
the cool thing is that

156
00:07:46,176 --> 00:07:51,086
to you some 170-plus units that

157
00:07:51,226 --> 00:07:52,556
You don't even have to

158
00:07:52,556 --> 00:07:55,386
You can just use them, like,

159
00:07:56,156 --> 00:08:01,236
And most of these

160
00:07:56,156 --> 00:08:01,236
And most of these

161
00:08:01,236 --> 00:08:03,706
with the International System

162
00:08:03,706 --> 00:08:05,936
that you're already used to

163
00:08:07,396 --> 00:08:08,656
Now let's look at an example.

164
00:08:09,286 --> 00:08:12,906
We have the dimension of

165
00:08:13,296 --> 00:08:16,046
of units that are class

166
00:08:16,046 --> 00:08:16,786
this dimension.

167
00:08:17,076 --> 00:08:19,136
And so, if we go back

168
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:21,596
instances of a dimension

169
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:24,386
what happens is any time you

170
00:08:24,386 --> 00:08:26,336
getting back an instance

171
00:08:27,226 --> 00:08:30,036
The difference between each

172
00:08:30,036 --> 00:08:33,035
their symbols are different,

173
00:08:33,035 --> 00:08:36,696
that define their

174
00:08:39,376 --> 00:08:43,366
So, just an overview of all of

175
00:08:43,366 --> 00:08:44,916
to you, all the different

176
00:08:45,126 --> 00:08:48,626
Remember I told you there's like

177
00:08:49,106 --> 00:08:50,636
play with them to

178
00:08:51,296 --> 00:08:53,956
But we have some pretty cool

179
00:08:53,956 --> 00:08:56,266
like area, mass,

180
00:08:56,676 --> 00:08:59,586
But also, some kind of

181
00:08:59,586 --> 00:09:04,796
and electric current, but sounds

182
00:08:59,586 --> 00:09:04,796
and electric current, but sounds

183
00:09:05,056 --> 00:09:07,256
So, let's go back to

184
00:09:07,326 --> 00:09:09,286
and our distance

185
00:09:09,696 --> 00:09:11,166
So, this is code

186
00:09:12,326 --> 00:09:13,936
Now, we're going to

187
00:09:13,936 --> 00:09:15,176
out because we're

188
00:09:15,866 --> 00:09:17,306
So, we're leaving

189
00:09:18,146 --> 00:09:20,916
but now we're defining

190
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:23,506
of six, but instead of

191
00:09:23,506 --> 00:09:24,626
we're passing in kilometers.

192
00:09:25,426 --> 00:09:29,746
Now, this is where things

193
00:09:29,836 --> 00:09:32,346
because we're now

194
00:09:32,456 --> 00:09:35,126
and distanceToGo

195
00:09:35,176 --> 00:09:36,166
and one's in kilometers.

196
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:38,956
What does this mean

197
00:09:39,076 --> 00:09:40,006
Is it in terms of feet?

198
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,536
It is in terms of kilometers?

199
00:09:41,716 --> 00:09:43,756
Will this stage just

200
00:09:43,826 --> 00:09:44,226
I don't know.

201
00:09:45,286 --> 00:09:46,976
But, phew, no, it won't.

202
00:09:47,066 --> 00:09:49,476
Actually what happened is

203
00:09:49,476 --> 00:09:51,156
of the base unit,

204
00:09:51,606 --> 00:09:55,176
And so what's cool about this is

205
00:09:55,176 --> 00:09:56,916
of this implicitly for you.

206
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:58,596
You don't have to

207
00:09:58,846 --> 00:10:00,676
You could just use the

208
00:09:58,846 --> 00:10:00,676
You could just use the

209
00:10:00,906 --> 00:10:02,086
with regular scalar values

210
00:10:02,086 --> 00:10:05,976
and you get the results

211
00:10:06,056 --> 00:10:09,846
So, now let's say, and

212
00:10:09,846 --> 00:10:14,336
to track the player at certain

213
00:10:14,336 --> 00:10:17,816
of the demo we're just printing

214
00:10:17,816 --> 00:10:19,376
to do something funkier,

215
00:10:19,376 --> 00:10:21,056
add more functionality

216
00:10:21,256 --> 00:10:22,576
But the key here is

217
00:10:22,576 --> 00:10:24,966
to compare these

218
00:10:24,966 --> 00:10:27,776
So Measurement has support for

219
00:10:27,776 --> 00:10:28,496
to be able to do this.

220
00:10:28,926 --> 00:10:32,976
And so if we were to

221
00:10:33,796 --> 00:10:36,136
we would get what we expect,

222
00:10:36,176 --> 00:10:38,506
because Measurement was

223
00:10:38,506 --> 00:10:41,286
that distanceTraveled is

224
00:10:44,576 --> 00:10:47,326
So, let's talk more

225
00:10:47,406 --> 00:10:49,216
because we haven't really

226
00:10:50,716 --> 00:10:53,196
As previously mentioned,

227
00:10:53,196 --> 00:10:55,246
in terms of their base unit.

228
00:10:56,056 --> 00:11:00,916
There are methods that

229
00:10:56,056 --> 00:11:00,916
There are methods that

230
00:11:01,246 --> 00:11:04,376
and from the base unit

231
00:11:04,376 --> 00:11:07,406
about that a little bit more

232
00:11:09,276 --> 00:11:12,316
The important thing, though,

233
00:11:12,316 --> 00:11:15,126
that conversion can only happen

234
00:11:15,536 --> 00:11:17,386
So, when you think of

235
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:22,376
you can convert kilometers

236
00:11:22,376 --> 00:11:25,026
to convert kilometers

237
00:11:25,366 --> 00:11:27,516
Conceptually that doesn't

238
00:11:28,086 --> 00:11:30,496
And so, in this case, with

239
00:11:30,496 --> 00:11:34,126
to do that, it would

240
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:36,506
or it would be a

241
00:11:38,896 --> 00:11:42,066
So, remember I had

242
00:11:42,066 --> 00:11:44,606
like 170 plus units

243
00:11:45,036 --> 00:11:48,506
Chances are, you won't need to

244
00:11:48,976 --> 00:11:51,586
but if you do, that's the

245
00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:53,826
about defining them,

246
00:11:53,866 --> 00:11:54,956
You can actually just use them,

247
00:11:55,066 --> 00:11:57,306
the units that are already

248
00:11:57,956 --> 00:12:00,696
but if you are creating a

249
00:11:57,956 --> 00:12:00,696
but if you are creating a

250
00:12:00,696 --> 00:12:02,866
about how the converter

251
00:12:04,016 --> 00:12:06,256
And so, the cool thing is

252
00:12:06,256 --> 00:12:08,646
that Measurement can

253
00:12:08,646 --> 00:12:11,396
for you implicitly even

254
00:12:12,326 --> 00:12:15,936
It just auto-magically works.

255
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:17,766
So, let's talk about

256
00:12:17,766 --> 00:12:19,166
We're making some custom

257
00:12:19,896 --> 00:12:25,106
We have a jamz unit here,

258
00:12:25,106 --> 00:12:28,126
to calculate total time

259
00:12:28,126 --> 00:12:29,946
of this unit called jamz.

260
00:12:30,286 --> 00:12:31,856
Seconds is a little

261
00:12:32,616 --> 00:12:36,846
But if you see here, we have

262
00:12:36,946 --> 00:12:37,456
What is that?

263
00:12:37,456 --> 00:12:38,996
We haven't really

264
00:12:39,766 --> 00:12:41,176
So let's go back to talking

265
00:12:41,176 --> 00:12:43,956
about conversions

266
00:12:44,196 --> 00:12:45,936
So again, to and

267
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:49,876
UnitConverter is a root class

268
00:12:50,266 --> 00:12:53,056
that describe this conversion.

269
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:57,016
So baseUnitValue(fromValue),

270
00:12:58,086 --> 00:13:01,626
UnitConverterLinear

271
00:12:58,086 --> 00:13:01,626
UnitConverterLinear

272
00:13:01,936 --> 00:13:03,546
and defines them linearly.

273
00:13:03,546 --> 00:13:05,866
So, for all the math people

274
00:13:05,866 --> 00:13:08,146
of A X plus B, where

275
00:13:08,146 --> 00:13:09,026
and B is the constant.

276
00:13:09,586 --> 00:13:12,476
So, if we go back

277
00:13:13,216 --> 00:13:17,796
we see here that this

278
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:19,966
a scalar value of

279
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:24,066
that one jamz unit is equivalent

280
00:13:24,146 --> 00:13:28,116
in our linear function, we have

281
00:13:28,116 --> 00:13:28,436
would be.

282
00:13:28,436 --> 00:13:32,206
So, if a jam session was

283
00:13:32,656 --> 00:13:35,076
then if we wanted to

284
00:13:35,076 --> 00:13:37,486
it would be four times 30

285
00:13:38,006 --> 00:13:39,036
and you could do the reverse.

286
00:13:39,036 --> 00:13:41,676
120 divided by 30 to

287
00:13:42,636 --> 00:13:47,026
Yeah. So let's say I wanted

288
00:13:47,356 --> 00:13:49,606
for length, for example,

289
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:51,956
to calculate distance traveled

290
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:53,656
I wanted to do something a

291
00:13:53,656 --> 00:13:54,006
like hopz.

292
00:13:55,216 --> 00:13:57,146
So, here, same concept.

293
00:13:57,696 --> 00:14:01,126
One hopz is equivalent

294
00:13:57,696 --> 00:14:01,126
One hopz is equivalent

295
00:14:01,546 --> 00:14:05,226
and so we're defining the

296
00:14:05,846 --> 00:14:07,916
and same with some

297
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:09,976
that I would create for this.

298
00:14:09,976 --> 00:14:14,026
So, you start to get the idea.

299
00:14:14,236 --> 00:14:16,476
So, if you recall

300
00:14:16,476 --> 00:14:19,366
about the jam session,

301
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:23,466
that I had named was the number

302
00:14:24,426 --> 00:14:26,836
Unfortunately, the

303
00:14:26,836 --> 00:14:28,616
of units does not

304
00:14:28,616 --> 00:14:30,336
that recognizes dance movements.

305
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:32,966
I'm not entirely sure

306
00:14:32,966 --> 00:14:34,386
that we are defining here today.

307
00:14:34,506 --> 00:14:36,006
And so, we have UnitDanceMove

308
00:14:36,696 --> 00:14:38,996
with a base unit of

309
00:14:40,486 --> 00:14:43,746
And so you see here that one

310
00:14:43,746 --> 00:14:45,756
to another wackyArmMovement,

311
00:14:45,756 --> 00:14:48,466
another way to think about how

312
00:14:48,466 --> 00:14:51,626
many of the base unit make

313
00:14:52,066 --> 00:14:55,726
So, here's one-to-ones so

314
00:14:55,926 --> 00:14:58,206
Let's say we wanted to

315
00:14:58,746 --> 00:14:59,826
It's like, approximately

316
00:14:59,826 --> 00:15:03,866
like four wackyArmMovements,

317
00:14:59,826 --> 00:15:03,866
like four wackyArmMovements,

318
00:15:04,086 --> 00:15:06,716
cabbagePatch is like

319
00:15:06,886 --> 00:15:11,736
Sure. And of course, no dance

320
00:15:11,776 --> 00:15:15,166
without jazzHands, which is

321
00:15:15,636 --> 00:15:17,216
I think it's pretty accurate,

322
00:15:18,566 --> 00:15:22,596
And so now, let's go back and

323
00:15:22,596 --> 00:15:23,976
that I had outlined earlier.

324
00:15:25,036 --> 00:15:27,886
So distance traveled, this

325
00:15:27,886 --> 00:15:30,756
which will be in terms of this

326
00:15:31,336 --> 00:15:33,736
jamTime will be in

327
00:15:34,706 --> 00:15:37,146
and dance moves will be

328
00:15:37,206 --> 00:15:41,816
So our player will be roboting

329
00:15:42,016 --> 00:15:44,406
And so the dance rate

330
00:15:44,406 --> 00:15:46,326
of meters per second,

331
00:15:46,586 --> 00:15:49,496
none of the other measurements

332
00:15:49,496 --> 00:15:51,146
so how are we going

333
00:15:52,216 --> 00:15:54,796
Well, we can take stepsTaken

334
00:15:55,266 --> 00:15:58,086
We can also take the jamTime

335
00:15:59,126 --> 00:16:01,456
and now we can actually

336
00:15:59,126 --> 00:16:01,456
and now we can actually

337
00:16:01,456 --> 00:16:03,066
in terms of meters per second.

338
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:07,096
And so the cool thing here

339
00:16:07,096 --> 00:16:08,506
of code we were actually able

340
00:16:08,506 --> 00:16:11,256
to completely define

341
00:16:11,826 --> 00:16:18,596
So, now we know how to actually

342
00:16:18,596 --> 00:16:19,846
as model objects,

343
00:16:20,506 --> 00:16:22,096
But I told you, though,

344
00:16:22,296 --> 00:16:24,776
that I want this game

345
00:16:25,326 --> 00:16:27,916
Now to do that we actually have

346
00:16:28,566 --> 00:16:29,896
That's where things

347
00:16:31,196 --> 00:16:34,656
So, if we have our player, and

348
00:16:34,656 --> 00:16:38,176
for only five feet, they danced

349
00:16:38,876 --> 00:16:39,346
Hard core.

350
00:16:39,986 --> 00:16:41,956
If we wanted to represent this

351
00:16:41,956 --> 00:16:43,416
across the world,

352
00:16:44,606 --> 00:16:47,036
Well, in Canada, we could

353
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:49,516
as it was previously written,

354
00:16:50,016 --> 00:16:53,486
If we were to try to represent

355
00:16:53,486 --> 00:16:55,486
we'd actually have to

356
00:16:56,736 --> 00:16:58,736
In Arabic, we'd have

357
00:16:58,946 --> 00:17:01,896
and change the number

358
00:16:58,946 --> 00:17:01,896
and change the number

359
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:03,746
that our right-to-left

360
00:17:04,316 --> 00:17:06,425
So, all of this is more

361
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:07,705
to add manually to my app.

362
00:17:08,715 --> 00:17:11,876
And then finally, in the

363
00:17:12,066 --> 00:17:13,116
What are those?

364
00:17:13,116 --> 00:17:14,356
What are those things?"

365
00:17:14,356 --> 00:17:19,256
So, then, not only do I have to

366
00:17:19,256 --> 00:17:22,376
of my calculations, but I also

367
00:17:22,376 --> 00:17:25,396
for formatting, which is

368
00:17:25,396 --> 00:17:26,826
to add to my app.

369
00:17:27,656 --> 00:17:28,946
So, what's the solution here?

370
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:31,576
You let Foundation do

371
00:17:32,296 --> 00:17:34,516
We have a new formatter

372
00:17:35,186 --> 00:17:39,376
It formatters both measurements

373
00:17:39,376 --> 00:17:40,836
so you don't have to

374
00:17:42,156 --> 00:17:43,166
So let's take a look at it.

375
00:17:43,776 --> 00:17:44,936
Its subclass is Formatter.

376
00:17:44,936 --> 00:17:46,036
If you're familiar with any

377
00:17:46,036 --> 00:17:48,426
of our other formatters,

378
00:17:48,936 --> 00:17:52,456
It has the unitOptions property,

379
00:17:52,456 --> 00:17:53,846
about unitOptions in a second.

380
00:17:54,776 --> 00:17:55,746
It also has unitStyle.

381
00:17:55,746 --> 00:17:56,796
So, again, if you're familiar

382
00:17:56,796 --> 00:17:58,856
with the other formatter,

383
00:17:59,436 --> 00:18:02,106
It has a locale that's setable.

384
00:17:59,436 --> 00:18:02,106
It has a locale that's setable.

385
00:18:02,276 --> 00:18:05,966
Now, chances are, you're

386
00:18:06,076 --> 00:18:08,566
to the current locale

387
00:18:08,566 --> 00:18:11,436
which is what this locale

388
00:18:11,816 --> 00:18:15,446
but if you needed to set

389
00:18:16,626 --> 00:18:18,456
It also takes a custom

390
00:18:18,456 --> 00:18:21,596
So, let's say you wanted your

391
00:18:21,596 --> 00:18:23,926
to be represented in terms

392
00:18:24,116 --> 00:18:26,126
you can provide a

393
00:18:26,126 --> 00:18:28,976
to do that for you.

394
00:18:29,046 --> 00:18:30,476
It also has methods that take

395
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:32,976
in both a Measurement

396
00:18:33,516 --> 00:18:36,916
So let's talk a little bit

397
00:18:37,976 --> 00:18:39,866
The cool thing is

398
00:18:39,986 --> 00:18:43,966
by default the formatter formats

399
00:18:43,966 --> 00:18:45,066
of your user's locale.

400
00:18:45,296 --> 00:18:46,596
So, you don't even

401
00:18:47,066 --> 00:18:48,776
It also takes into account

402
00:18:48,806 --> 00:18:52,446
So, you know, if you're

403
00:18:52,446 --> 00:18:55,456
of road distance verses in terms

404
00:18:55,456 --> 00:19:00,506
to want to use different units

405
00:18:55,456 --> 00:19:00,506
to want to use different units

406
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:02,726
So I'll take a look

407
00:19:02,726 --> 00:19:04,216
that MeasurementFormatter

408
00:19:05,466 --> 00:19:08,536
One is provided unit, and

409
00:19:08,536 --> 00:19:11,686
where we want to pass in a

410
00:19:12,006 --> 00:19:15,766
but our locale is the U.S. Now

411
00:19:15,766 --> 00:19:18,616
for road distance for

412
00:19:18,936 --> 00:19:20,456
because that's what's

413
00:19:20,956 --> 00:19:23,556
But if you set provided

414
00:19:23,556 --> 00:19:26,726
that whatever unit you

415
00:19:26,726 --> 00:19:27,796
that actually gets formatted.

416
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:31,416
There's also an action

417
00:19:31,536 --> 00:19:36,126
So, this is great in

418
00:19:36,156 --> 00:19:38,366
So, if your, you know, your

419
00:19:38,696 --> 00:19:41,246
and you're really concerned

420
00:19:41,996 --> 00:19:44,066
then instead of putting

421
00:19:44,066 --> 00:19:46,376
which would take up a

422
00:19:46,376 --> 00:19:48,876
you can actually have it

423
00:19:49,386 --> 00:19:52,896
Another is temperature

424
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:54,456
So let's say you

425
00:19:54,456 --> 00:19:56,236
that represents 90

426
00:19:56,526 --> 00:19:58,086
but you don't want

427
00:19:58,086 --> 00:19:58,926
to actually show.

428
00:19:59,356 --> 00:20:03,676
You can set this to get the

429
00:19:59,356 --> 00:20:03,676
You can set this to get the

430
00:20:03,676 --> 00:20:05,356
So, let's play around

431
00:20:05,356 --> 00:20:06,516
We have our formatter here,

432
00:20:07,486 --> 00:20:09,996
and we have our original

433
00:20:09,996 --> 00:20:11,876
in five kilometers,

434
00:20:11,876 --> 00:20:12,456
player danced.

435
00:20:13,336 --> 00:20:16,166
And now we want to get a

436
00:20:17,086 --> 00:20:20,756
You'll see that the result is

437
00:20:20,756 --> 00:20:22,496
about this is that in

438
00:20:22,656 --> 00:20:24,756
not only did we get the

439
00:20:25,056 --> 00:20:28,016
but we didn't have to do

440
00:20:28,246 --> 00:20:30,586
just out-of-the-box

441
00:20:30,786 --> 00:20:33,046
it knew exactly what to do.

442
00:20:33,456 --> 00:20:36,206
Now let's say that we give it

443
00:20:36,716 --> 00:20:38,536
And Measurement,

444
00:20:38,536 --> 00:20:42,986
that has no conception, no idea

445
00:20:44,296 --> 00:20:48,246
but we create this hopz

446
00:20:48,376 --> 00:20:51,896
to the formatter, and

447
00:20:51,896 --> 00:20:54,326
to do the conversion

448
00:20:54,816 --> 00:20:58,286
We don't have to do anything.

449
00:20:58,286 --> 00:21:01,146
Now let's say though, you know,

450
00:20:58,286 --> 00:21:01,146
Now let's say though, you know,

451
00:21:01,146 --> 00:21:02,526
and we actually want

452
00:21:02,936 --> 00:21:04,106
so we'll set provided unit.

453
00:21:05,036 --> 00:21:07,716
We'll give it a measurement

454
00:21:08,626 --> 00:21:11,726
And now the result will

455
00:21:11,726 --> 00:21:16,166
Now this case is a

456
00:21:16,246 --> 00:21:19,396
because not only are we

457
00:21:19,466 --> 00:21:21,216
but we're also providing

458
00:21:21,216 --> 00:21:22,956
within a custom dimension,

459
00:21:23,326 --> 00:21:25,906
And so at this point, it's

460
00:21:25,906 --> 00:21:27,386
what will MeasurementFormatter

461
00:21:28,456 --> 00:21:30,486
Oh, well, it'll do

462
00:21:30,636 --> 00:21:31,376
which is pretty awesome.

463
00:21:32,046 --> 00:21:35,896
So, now, I'm going to hand

464
00:21:35,896 --> 00:21:38,376
of the Foundation

465
00:21:38,376 --> 00:21:41,436
to show how measurements

466
00:21:41,436 --> 00:21:43,926
and formatted in the High

467
00:21:46,766 --> 00:21:46,966
Thanks [applause].

468
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:49,026
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Daphne.

469
00:21:49,026 --> 00:21:50,666
So, my name is Peter Hosey.

470
00:21:50,906 --> 00:21:53,176
I am also an engineer

471
00:21:53,966 --> 00:21:57,176
and like Daphne said, this

472
00:21:57,396 --> 00:21:59,986
where we're showing a list

473
00:22:00,846 --> 00:22:04,236
As you tap on each one,

474
00:22:04,236 --> 00:22:06,536
about the level, the

475
00:22:07,196 --> 00:22:09,256
You see some important

476
00:22:09,256 --> 00:22:11,356
about playing the level,

477
00:22:12,496 --> 00:22:15,136
And you even see your statistics

478
00:22:15,136 --> 00:22:17,446
of how well you've

479
00:22:18,676 --> 00:22:21,516
You see things like

480
00:22:21,516 --> 00:22:24,586
how many wacky arm

481
00:22:25,236 --> 00:22:26,566
You see how far you've danced.

482
00:22:26,566 --> 00:22:27,876
You see how fast you've danced.

483
00:22:29,126 --> 00:22:31,956
But these values are

484
00:22:32,596 --> 00:22:34,496
They lack dimension.

485
00:22:35,936 --> 00:22:39,536
So we don't know,

486
00:22:40,176 --> 00:22:46,986
Now you could implement an

487
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:50,506
You could start small by just

488
00:22:50,506 --> 00:22:51,456
of each of these numbers.

489
00:22:52,216 --> 00:22:54,316
You could maybe build out

490
00:22:55,706 --> 00:22:57,956
have a unit conversion system

491
00:22:57,956 --> 00:23:00,566
that will understand

492
00:22:57,956 --> 00:23:00,566
that will understand

493
00:23:00,566 --> 00:23:02,816
and translate the unit

494
00:23:02,816 --> 00:23:05,156
and that's a lot

495
00:23:05,256 --> 00:23:08,716
Like Daphne said, let Foundation

496
00:23:08,716 --> 00:23:10,856
We now have Measurement

497
00:23:10,856 --> 00:23:12,556
and MeasurementFormatter

498
00:23:13,536 --> 00:23:15,976
so let's use them in our game.

499
00:23:16,566 --> 00:23:21,096
So we're going to start by

500
00:23:21,286 --> 00:23:23,486
that Daphne showed you,

501
00:23:24,016 --> 00:23:27,336
We've got a couple of length

502
00:23:27,896 --> 00:23:31,136
and we have our four

503
00:23:31,136 --> 00:23:32,916
that do not come

504
00:23:35,156 --> 00:23:38,346
Now that we've got our custom

505
00:23:38,346 --> 00:23:40,876
into our model, which

506
00:23:41,626 --> 00:23:44,226
which has our basic

507
00:23:44,976 --> 00:23:47,356
and includes the

508
00:23:47,356 --> 00:23:49,216
which are just numbers.

509
00:23:49,576 --> 00:23:51,796
So let's change them

510
00:23:52,276 --> 00:23:54,936
So, now we have a measurement

511
00:23:54,936 --> 00:23:56,246
of length, and a

512
00:23:56,706 --> 00:23:58,346
and as we change the properties,

513
00:23:58,886 --> 00:24:00,596
so much we change

514
00:23:58,886 --> 00:24:00,596
so much we change

515
00:24:01,246 --> 00:24:04,056
So, now it's possible to create

516
00:24:04,866 --> 00:24:08,636
and we want to do that in

517
00:24:08,826 --> 00:24:10,976
which is a controller for this

518
00:24:12,206 --> 00:24:16,246
Our List ViewController

519
00:24:16,736 --> 00:24:21,496
which returns a JSON list of

520
00:24:21,726 --> 00:24:23,376
containing all of

521
00:24:24,836 --> 00:24:27,956
And particularly includes

522
00:24:28,156 --> 00:24:29,166
as just numbers.

523
00:24:29,836 --> 00:24:31,626
So, we want to create

524
00:24:31,676 --> 00:24:32,976
around these numbers,

525
00:24:34,086 --> 00:24:36,516
so now this a number

526
00:24:36,776 --> 00:24:38,136
This is a number of Hopz.

527
00:24:38,276 --> 00:24:40,546
This is a number of hopzPerJamz.

528
00:24:41,286 --> 00:24:48,096
Now that this information is in

529
00:24:48,096 --> 00:24:50,036
as measurements in our

530
00:24:50,866 --> 00:24:52,266
and that's the only

531
00:24:52,266 --> 00:24:53,116
in the List ViewController.

532
00:24:54,276 --> 00:24:56,426
Now we can go over to the

533
00:24:56,426 --> 00:24:59,886
which is what shows this

534
00:25:00,136 --> 00:25:01,716
for every one of these levels,

535
00:25:02,286 --> 00:25:07,386
and we can use our

536
00:25:07,526 --> 00:25:11,716
So, we already have

537
00:25:11,776 --> 00:25:14,756
This is a NumberFormatter, and

538
00:25:14,896 --> 00:25:17,736
to six digits with zeros,

539
00:25:18,236 --> 00:25:19,576
but we want to build

540
00:25:19,576 --> 00:25:20,906
We want to make this

541
00:25:21,476 --> 00:25:24,336
So we're going to add

542
00:25:25,566 --> 00:25:27,096
and I'll explain

543
00:25:28,336 --> 00:25:29,486
Now that we've created them,

544
00:25:30,176 --> 00:25:32,856
we go to the same place we're

545
00:25:32,856 --> 00:25:34,806
formatter, which is in

546
00:25:35,146 --> 00:25:37,136
This is inherited

547
00:25:37,136 --> 00:25:38,096
and here we're overwriting it.

548
00:25:39,086 --> 00:25:41,236
We configure the

549
00:25:41,236 --> 00:25:44,286
with our minimum integer

550
00:25:44,286 --> 00:25:45,976
to configure our

551
00:25:46,656 --> 00:25:49,226
to use our provided unit,

552
00:25:49,936 --> 00:25:51,066
which you can't tell

553
00:25:52,536 --> 00:25:54,346
And use our NumberFormatter

554
00:25:54,586 --> 00:25:56,886
so that we continue

555
00:25:58,286 --> 00:26:01,056
And I mentioned we created

556
00:25:58,286 --> 00:26:01,056
And I mentioned we created

557
00:26:01,056 --> 00:26:02,266
so let's configure

558
00:26:03,076 --> 00:26:05,296
This one we want to use the

559
00:26:05,296 --> 00:26:06,846
so we're not going to

560
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:13,186
but we're still going to set

561
00:26:14,236 --> 00:26:18,986
And now if I run that, oops, oh.

562
00:26:19,646 --> 00:26:21,946
So, I've configured

563
00:26:22,576 --> 00:26:25,666
Now I need to actually use the

564
00:26:27,316 --> 00:26:29,266
So we're already

565
00:26:29,606 --> 00:26:31,766
and we say sting

566
00:26:33,136 --> 00:26:34,496
Well that worked fine

567
00:26:34,496 --> 00:26:35,326
but now it's a measurement.

568
00:26:35,596 --> 00:26:37,566
So now we need to talk to

569
00:26:37,566 --> 00:26:39,286
Now, it's a simple

570
00:26:40,286 --> 00:26:41,596
Otherwise, it's exactly

571
00:26:42,496 --> 00:26:43,736
Works the same for

572
00:26:44,906 --> 00:26:47,426
The other two we're creating

573
00:26:47,736 --> 00:26:49,806
and you can imagine how

574
00:26:49,806 --> 00:26:50,976
for your localization effort.

575
00:26:52,366 --> 00:26:53,806
Here too we want

576
00:26:54,936 --> 00:26:57,916
So, we'll use our other

577
00:26:58,076 --> 00:26:59,006
again, the same thing.

578
00:26:59,006 --> 00:27:01,876
We do string from, in this

579
00:26:59,006 --> 00:27:01,876
We do string from, in this

580
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:06,216
and this returns a string,

581
00:27:07,276 --> 00:27:08,636
So now we can run the app.

582
00:27:15,226 --> 00:27:17,626
And now we see our

583
00:27:18,456 --> 00:27:21,196
So this is a start, but,

584
00:27:21,336 --> 00:27:24,346
we're still not really

585
00:27:24,346 --> 00:27:25,426
which is our goal to start with.

586
00:27:26,216 --> 00:27:28,536
We need to show these

587
00:27:29,326 --> 00:27:33,226
So we could do some

588
00:27:33,716 --> 00:27:35,926
but MeasurementFormatter

589
00:27:35,926 --> 00:27:39,596
So, we're going to create one

590
00:27:40,346 --> 00:27:42,806
and as we have the custom

591
00:27:43,046 --> 00:27:45,056
we're also going to

592
00:27:45,136 --> 00:27:45,896
MeasurementFormatter.

593
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:49,666
As we create it, same

594
00:27:49,666 --> 00:27:52,186
except we don't' actually

595
00:27:52,776 --> 00:27:55,896
because MeasurementFormatter

596
00:27:55,896 --> 00:27:58,956
automatically to the unit

597
00:27:58,956 --> 00:28:00,816
that the player expects

598
00:27:58,956 --> 00:28:00,816
that the player expects

599
00:28:02,866 --> 00:28:06,806
Now, this is where it's going

600
00:28:06,806 --> 00:28:07,726
so bear with me a moment.

601
00:28:08,646 --> 00:28:11,246
We're currently talking

602
00:28:11,526 --> 00:28:12,686
asking it for one string,

603
00:28:12,846 --> 00:28:14,186
and passing it directly

604
00:28:14,186 --> 00:28:21,016
So what we're going to do

605
00:28:21,016 --> 00:28:23,926
to the customUnitsMeasurement

606
00:28:24,206 --> 00:28:25,996
get its string for

607
00:28:27,056 --> 00:28:29,676
Then we talk to the

608
00:28:30,026 --> 00:28:31,836
and get its string

609
00:28:32,726 --> 00:28:35,156
And then we'll use a

610
00:28:35,386 --> 00:28:39,006
to put these two things

611
00:28:39,006 --> 00:28:42,806
that we will pass to the label,

612
00:28:42,806 --> 00:28:44,306
and we do it also

613
00:28:44,836 --> 00:28:46,896
And that's all we have to do.

614
00:28:53,136 --> 00:28:57,766
In order to show both our

615
00:28:57,766 --> 00:28:59,186
that the player expects

616
00:29:00,526 --> 00:29:01,626
their real world distance.

617
00:29:02,516 --> 00:29:06,596
[ Applause ]

618
00:29:07,096 --> 00:29:08,456
But we don't need to stop there,

619
00:29:08,566 --> 00:29:11,796
because remember the goal

620
00:29:11,796 --> 00:29:13,096
over the world in every country.

621
00:29:14,096 --> 00:29:16,026
So miles is great in

622
00:29:16,026 --> 00:29:16,896
we're in the United States.

623
00:29:16,896 --> 00:29:17,646
We see miles.

624
00:29:17,646 --> 00:29:20,206
But we want to make sure

625
00:29:21,236 --> 00:29:25,246
So I'm going to make use of

626
00:29:25,246 --> 00:29:28,966
of your scheme, so I'm going

627
00:29:39,356 --> 00:29:40,846
I'm going to duplicate

628
00:29:41,376 --> 00:29:43,826
and when it duplicates

629
00:29:43,826 --> 00:29:47,556
It's going to ask me for a

630
00:29:47,726 --> 00:29:49,936
to give my scheme a

631
00:29:50,696 --> 00:29:56,766
And now, having named my scheme,

632
00:29:57,346 --> 00:30:00,816
I'm going to make one simple

633
00:29:57,346 --> 00:30:00,816
I'm going to make one simple

634
00:30:03,066 --> 00:30:06,506
Options tab, Application Region.

635
00:30:07,536 --> 00:30:14,586
I'm going to our testing into an

636
00:30:15,396 --> 00:30:21,776
And now, I'm going to

637
00:30:21,996 --> 00:30:24,256
and with no code

638
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:26,686
with no configuration

639
00:30:26,906 --> 00:30:29,746
just changing the scheme, we

640
00:30:29,796 --> 00:30:30,926
this shows kilometers.

641
00:30:32,976 --> 00:30:35,006
That's all you have to

642
00:30:35,006 --> 00:30:36,576
with our new Measurement

643
00:30:36,576 --> 00:30:38,666
and MeasurementFormatter

644
00:30:38,986 --> 00:30:39,316
Thank you [applause].

645
00:30:40,276 --> 00:30:42,966
Thank you, Daphne.

646
00:30:43,396 --> 00:30:44,316
&gt;&gt; Thanks so much, Peter.

647
00:30:44,316 --> 00:30:46,616
So, obviously this game

648
00:30:46,616 --> 00:30:50,446
I'm, like, super

649
00:30:50,706 --> 00:30:51,946
Let's wrap up real quick though.

650
00:30:52,206 --> 00:30:55,966
So, we just saw throughout

651
00:30:55,966 --> 00:30:59,246
and in the demo how Measurements

652
00:30:59,246 --> 00:31:01,306
that we can use in our apps,

653
00:30:59,246 --> 00:31:01,306
that we can use in our apps,

654
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:04,096
We also saw that it's

655
00:31:04,126 --> 00:31:09,246
and they require very little

656
00:31:09,246 --> 00:31:12,556
And the best part

657
00:31:12,556 --> 00:31:15,886
of this very powerful

658
00:31:15,886 --> 00:31:19,126
without having to specify

659
00:31:19,126 --> 00:31:20,316
just right out of the box.

660
00:31:21,216 --> 00:31:22,336
So, now you don't actually have

661
00:31:22,386 --> 00:31:25,056
to suddenly become a

662
00:31:25,596 --> 00:31:27,876
change all the logic

663
00:31:27,926 --> 00:31:29,076
to be able to support this.

664
00:31:29,136 --> 00:31:30,786
You could just use it as-is.

665
00:31:31,676 --> 00:31:34,516
If you'd like more information,

666
00:31:34,646 --> 00:31:37,776
These sessions are

667
00:31:37,886 --> 00:31:39,656
but if you're super

668
00:31:39,656 --> 00:31:41,396
I would recommend

669
00:31:42,766 --> 00:31:43,816
and thank you so much.
