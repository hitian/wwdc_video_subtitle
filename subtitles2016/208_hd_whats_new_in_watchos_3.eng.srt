[ Applause ]

3
00:00:32,055 --> 00:00:32,326
&gt;&gt; All right.

4
00:00:32,786 --> 00:00:33,676
Thanks very much.

5
00:00:34,266 --> 00:00:37,946
So I'm excited to tell you all

6
00:00:38,596 --> 00:00:41,926
Now, of course we've

7
00:00:42,326 --> 00:00:44,616
on optimizing the

8
00:00:44,776 --> 00:00:47,426
and there's been a ton

9
00:00:47,426 --> 00:00:50,766
to make sure that all of your

10
00:00:51,986 --> 00:00:54,916
We've also spent a bunch of

11
00:00:55,486 --> 00:00:58,496
and that's really in service

12
00:00:58,996 --> 00:01:01,346
because the faster we can

13
00:00:58,996 --> 00:01:01,346
because the faster we can

14
00:01:01,786 --> 00:01:03,196
the faster they can

15
00:01:03,196 --> 00:01:04,936
and the faster we can

16
00:01:05,016 --> 00:01:07,436
to drop their wrist again,

17
00:01:08,696 --> 00:01:11,896
Now in addition to all these

18
00:01:12,266 --> 00:01:15,716
we've also spent a bunch of

19
00:01:15,716 --> 00:01:17,156
in all of our apps as well.

20
00:01:19,256 --> 00:01:21,296
Now all of those

21
00:01:21,626 --> 00:01:25,336
around three key qualities for

22
00:01:25,336 --> 00:01:27,366
and warn you you will

23
00:01:27,366 --> 00:01:29,176
about throughout the rest of

24
00:01:30,286 --> 00:01:33,316
So the first one is making

25
00:01:34,256 --> 00:01:37,016
Now, being a glanceable

26
00:01:37,016 --> 00:01:40,126
of different things, and it

27
00:01:40,706 --> 00:01:42,066
because having a complication

28
00:01:42,066 --> 00:01:44,936
on the watch face gives you

29
00:01:44,936 --> 00:01:48,356
to present the most important

30
00:01:48,476 --> 00:01:50,366
to the user at just a glance.

31
00:01:51,606 --> 00:01:55,076
Of course, in watchOS

32
00:01:55,166 --> 00:01:58,316
In watchOS 3, that functionality

33
00:01:58,786 --> 00:02:01,456
which is a great place to

34
00:01:58,786 --> 00:02:01,456
which is a great place to

35
00:02:01,456 --> 00:02:04,166
as well, because it's really

36
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:07,286
on the system and gives you

37
00:02:07,286 --> 00:02:10,476
and summary of the best and

38
00:02:10,476 --> 00:02:11,116
from your apps.

39
00:02:11,926 --> 00:02:14,906
So in addition to being

40
00:02:14,906 --> 00:02:18,686
of our apps to be actionable,

41
00:02:18,686 --> 00:02:19,696
of different things as well.

42
00:02:20,806 --> 00:02:23,316
It might mean that you take

43
00:02:23,926 --> 00:02:25,616
You've seen that we've

44
00:02:25,616 --> 00:02:27,336
of our built-in apps

45
00:02:27,336 --> 00:02:30,386
that the most common actions

46
00:02:30,386 --> 00:02:31,706
with just a couple of taps.

47
00:02:32,536 --> 00:02:34,956
The Workout app, you can

48
00:02:34,956 --> 00:02:36,486
and start a workout

49
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:40,386
The timer app now raises

50
00:02:40,386 --> 00:02:42,206
that you'll want to set

51
00:02:42,566 --> 00:02:43,556
so that once you're in it,

52
00:02:43,556 --> 00:02:46,416
with just one tap you can

53
00:02:47,486 --> 00:02:49,086
And so this kind of

54
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:50,796
that we definitely would

55
00:02:50,856 --> 00:02:53,206
figure out the things that

56
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:55,906
in your apps, and brings

57
00:02:55,906 --> 00:02:57,376
and make them really

58
00:02:59,176 --> 00:03:01,466
Of course, being actionable

59
00:02:59,176 --> 00:03:01,466
Of course, being actionable

60
00:03:01,466 --> 00:03:03,936
that you have to be able to take

61
00:03:04,416 --> 00:03:07,966
It might just mean presenting

62
00:03:07,966 --> 00:03:10,636
to act on, even if they're

63
00:03:10,636 --> 00:03:12,116
to take an action on the watch.

64
00:03:12,626 --> 00:03:14,956
Again, complications are

65
00:03:14,956 --> 00:03:16,206
and the new dock as well,

66
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:18,406
presenting the most

67
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:21,306
that users can then go and act

68
00:03:21,786 --> 00:03:25,736
And then the third quality,

69
00:03:26,046 --> 00:03:29,206
making sure that your apps are

70
00:03:29,206 --> 00:03:30,646
as soon as the users want them.

71
00:03:31,806 --> 00:03:33,466
And a bunch of the

72
00:03:33,466 --> 00:03:36,246
in watchOS 3 is really

73
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:39,086
of making all of the apps

74
00:03:39,536 --> 00:03:40,866
By keeping them in memory,

75
00:03:40,866 --> 00:03:42,826
which we'll talk a little bit

76
00:03:42,826 --> 00:03:45,836
that they can resume really

77
00:03:45,836 --> 00:03:47,486
that they're as responsive

78
00:03:47,946 --> 00:03:49,796
And the best thing that you

79
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:51,246
that your apps remain

80
00:03:51,246 --> 00:03:53,486
to do adopt the new background

81
00:03:53,486 --> 00:03:55,686
which we'll talk about in

82
00:03:55,686 --> 00:03:58,006
that your apps already have

83
00:03:58,006 --> 00:04:03,666
to display to the user when

84
00:03:58,006 --> 00:04:03,666
to display to the user when

85
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:06,516
So thinking about apps,

86
00:04:06,516 --> 00:04:08,566
to a full-screen view of an app.

87
00:04:08,626 --> 00:04:10,776
That's what a lot

88
00:04:10,776 --> 00:04:12,976
about when they first

89
00:04:13,106 --> 00:04:15,686
but that may not be the

90
00:04:15,686 --> 00:04:17,546
to interact with your

91
00:04:18,356 --> 00:04:19,736
because to keep interaction

92
00:04:19,815 --> 00:04:22,756
there's some other really great

93
00:04:22,756 --> 00:04:25,306
to use for a lot of the most

94
00:04:26,036 --> 00:04:28,286
Of course, there's

95
00:04:28,286 --> 00:04:30,056
on the watch face,

96
00:04:30,516 --> 00:04:33,026
And notifications,

97
00:04:33,026 --> 00:04:34,216
at the most relevant time.

98
00:04:35,226 --> 00:04:38,516
And notifications on Apple

99
00:04:38,516 --> 00:04:41,276
to run code to populate the

100
00:04:41,276 --> 00:04:44,876
and custom UI to present

101
00:04:45,846 --> 00:04:50,716
And of course, with the new dock

102
00:04:50,716 --> 00:04:52,936
to your apps with just the

103
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:54,796
no matter where you

104
00:04:55,446 --> 00:04:57,726
Now, apps in the doc are great,

105
00:04:57,796 --> 00:04:59,876
because they're immediately

106
00:04:59,976 --> 00:05:02,416
As soon as you tap on

107
00:04:59,976 --> 00:05:02,416
As soon as you tap on

108
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:04,046
and you can interact

109
00:05:04,046 --> 00:05:05,226
without having to wait at all.

110
00:05:06,356 --> 00:05:09,366
The dock is great, not just for

111
00:05:09,366 --> 00:05:11,196
but also for consuming

112
00:05:11,676 --> 00:05:14,676
Glances in watchOS 2, that

113
00:05:14,676 --> 00:05:17,886
into the dock in watchOS

114
00:05:17,886 --> 00:05:20,576
through a view of

115
00:05:20,576 --> 00:05:22,926
from your favorite

116
00:05:22,926 --> 00:05:25,846
to get a high-level overview of

117
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:29,506
So the dock combines the best

118
00:05:29,506 --> 00:05:31,176
with quick access to your apps

119
00:05:31,446 --> 00:05:33,176
to provide even more

120
00:05:33,746 --> 00:05:36,256
So for something like reminders,

121
00:05:36,786 --> 00:05:39,886
You can get a quick overview of

122
00:05:40,426 --> 00:05:42,776
and you can tap in to

123
00:05:42,776 --> 00:05:44,516
and make it interactive,

124
00:05:45,826 --> 00:05:49,076
For other kinds of apps, you

125
00:05:49,656 --> 00:05:51,726
For example, the Workout app,

126
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:53,896
we've brought those most

127
00:05:53,896 --> 00:05:56,736
to perform right to the top

128
00:05:56,736 --> 00:05:59,996
tap in to bring the app full

129
00:06:00,106 --> 00:06:01,496
be starting your workouts.

130
00:06:02,526 --> 00:06:04,536
But the dock is also,

131
00:06:04,536 --> 00:06:06,506
great for just viewing

132
00:06:06,976 --> 00:06:09,446
So an app like the

133
00:06:09,446 --> 00:06:12,326
for just getting a summary of

134
00:06:12,516 --> 00:06:16,226
And with the Activity

135
00:06:16,226 --> 00:06:18,836
up the full screen, you can

136
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:21,336
that's really glanceable

137
00:06:21,866 --> 00:06:25,406
The Activity app itself has

138
00:06:25,406 --> 00:06:28,016
into it to simplify the

139
00:06:28,646 --> 00:06:32,146
So where in watchOS 2 it was

140
00:06:32,376 --> 00:06:35,016
each of which could scroll

141
00:06:35,016 --> 00:06:37,056
there's just one view,

142
00:06:37,056 --> 00:06:39,446
that has the summary of

143
00:06:39,446 --> 00:06:40,686
and some of the detail below.

144
00:06:41,066 --> 00:06:42,886
So it's really easy

145
00:06:42,886 --> 00:06:47,346
to get the information

146
00:06:47,346 --> 00:06:49,916
Now, we want to keep

147
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:53,766
as short as possible, and

148
00:06:53,766 --> 00:06:56,156
and the enhancements

149
00:06:56,156 --> 00:06:59,846
and live right away

150
00:07:00,046 --> 00:07:02,016
that the most tasks

151
00:07:02,016 --> 00:07:03,916
on Apple Watch can

152
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:05,286
in just a couple of seconds.

153
00:07:06,326 --> 00:07:08,546
And so as you're thinking about

154
00:07:08,546 --> 00:07:11,916
for Apple Watch, for watchOS

155
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:13,626
and you're contemplating

156
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:16,156
I would definitely

157
00:07:16,156 --> 00:07:19,456
of time thinking about how

158
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:23,046
Two seconds is obviously a

159
00:07:23,046 --> 00:07:25,346
for that can really help

160
00:07:25,346 --> 00:07:29,456
to design your apps to make

161
00:07:29,456 --> 00:07:30,766
on Apple Watch as possible.

162
00:07:31,366 --> 00:07:35,476
So with the rest of our time, I

163
00:07:36,336 --> 00:07:38,036
The first is Background

164
00:07:38,276 --> 00:07:41,356
As I mentioned, this is a

165
00:07:41,356 --> 00:07:42,736
that is Background App

166
00:07:42,736 --> 00:07:44,856
for building responsive

167
00:07:44,856 --> 00:07:47,796
to spend a bunch of

168
00:07:47,876 --> 00:07:49,326
Then I also wanted

169
00:07:49,326 --> 00:07:52,506
about simplifying navigation,

170
00:07:52,506 --> 00:07:54,206
to simplify navigation

171
00:07:54,696 --> 00:07:56,556
but the next step is

172
00:07:56,556 --> 00:07:57,716
within your apps as well.

173
00:07:57,856 --> 00:08:00,286
And so we've got some ideas of

174
00:07:57,856 --> 00:08:00,286
And so we've got some ideas of

175
00:08:00,286 --> 00:08:03,126
that we'll share, and

176
00:08:03,126 --> 00:08:05,426
that I'm sure you can come up

177
00:08:05,426 --> 00:08:06,456
in your own apps as well.

178
00:08:07,686 --> 00:08:08,936
Then we'll spend

179
00:08:09,036 --> 00:08:10,836
about expanding API

180
00:08:11,176 --> 00:08:12,486
We've brought some

181
00:08:12,486 --> 00:08:14,126
from our platforms,

182
00:08:14,126 --> 00:08:15,956
We've got some brand new ones,

183
00:08:16,286 --> 00:08:17,836
and we've got some

184
00:08:17,836 --> 00:08:20,316
to our existing frameworks

185
00:08:20,316 --> 00:08:22,706
about a bunch of the

186
00:08:22,706 --> 00:08:24,976
and give you some great

187
00:08:25,056 --> 00:08:26,346
that have even more detail.

188
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:28,986
And then we'll end by

189
00:08:28,986 --> 00:08:32,076
and configuration, because

190
00:08:32,076 --> 00:08:32,726
the first step.

191
00:08:33,006 --> 00:08:34,746
You also need to get

192
00:08:34,746 --> 00:08:36,006
and configure it on their watch.

193
00:08:36,895 --> 00:08:39,326
So let's get started with

194
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:42,976
Background App Refresh

195
00:08:43,206 --> 00:08:45,206
of building a responsive

196
00:08:46,556 --> 00:08:48,836
And before you've

197
00:08:49,256 --> 00:08:51,456
Background App Refresh is

198
00:08:52,116 --> 00:08:54,446
You don't actually

199
00:08:54,446 --> 00:08:55,846
to get some of its benefits.

200
00:08:56,736 --> 00:08:58,796
So the first thing is that all

201
00:08:58,796 --> 00:09:01,686
of the users favorite

202
00:08:58,796 --> 00:09:01,686
of the users favorite

203
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:05,296
They're launched in the

204
00:09:05,446 --> 00:09:08,086
and kept there ready to go so

205
00:09:08,086 --> 00:09:10,876
to get them, it's just a short

206
00:09:10,876 --> 00:09:12,646
to wait for a full

207
00:09:13,966 --> 00:09:15,266
Now, I mentioned

208
00:09:15,266 --> 00:09:16,546
to the user's favorite apps,

209
00:09:16,906 --> 00:09:18,786
and I do mean something

210
00:09:19,406 --> 00:09:20,896
This is all of the apps that are

211
00:09:20,896 --> 00:09:23,966
on the user's current watch

212
00:09:24,176 --> 00:09:25,616
on the current watch

213
00:09:26,056 --> 00:09:27,436
that app is one of

214
00:09:27,676 --> 00:09:29,676
And all of the apps

215
00:09:29,676 --> 00:09:31,326
in their dock are

216
00:09:32,136 --> 00:09:34,826
These apps are the ones that

217
00:09:34,826 --> 00:09:36,576
to go as soon as they're needed.

218
00:09:36,856 --> 00:09:39,406
They're the ones that the user

219
00:09:39,406 --> 00:09:41,406
because they're either a

220
00:09:41,746 --> 00:09:43,526
or just an easy scroll

221
00:09:43,986 --> 00:09:46,066
And so we want them to

222
00:09:46,066 --> 00:09:47,426
and as responsive as possible.

223
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:50,046
And as I mentioned, you don't

224
00:09:50,046 --> 00:09:52,296
Even your existing watchOS

225
00:09:52,296 --> 00:09:53,196
behavior automatically.

226
00:09:54,356 --> 00:09:57,816
But of course, there

227
00:09:57,816 --> 00:09:59,556
with Background App

228
00:09:59,906 --> 00:10:02,146
to make your apps even more

229
00:09:59,906 --> 00:10:02,146
to make your apps even more

230
00:10:02,146 --> 00:10:03,936
to the foreground and

231
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:05,156
up to date and ready to go.

232
00:10:06,716 --> 00:10:08,726
And so the first

233
00:10:08,726 --> 00:10:11,026
with this are obviously

234
00:10:11,026 --> 00:10:12,036
and updating your app.

235
00:10:12,576 --> 00:10:14,616
Keeping your app up to date

236
00:10:15,516 --> 00:10:17,886
But there's another

237
00:10:18,216 --> 00:10:19,806
that might be immediately

238
00:10:20,186 --> 00:10:23,166
and that is that you want to

239
00:10:24,366 --> 00:10:26,176
Now you might be wondering

240
00:10:26,436 --> 00:10:29,466
because you haven't

241
00:10:29,856 --> 00:10:32,636
And this applies specifically

242
00:10:33,476 --> 00:10:36,776
Now, when the dock first

243
00:10:36,776 --> 00:10:39,716
all of the apps that are in

244
00:10:39,716 --> 00:10:41,446
but they're suspended and

245
00:10:42,216 --> 00:10:43,496
So what's displayed as soon

246
00:10:43,496 --> 00:10:46,046
as the dock comes forward is a

247
00:10:46,046 --> 00:10:47,226
like in its last state.

248
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:50,856
Once the user settles on

249
00:10:50,996 --> 00:10:52,716
it will be resumed

250
00:10:52,716 --> 00:10:54,516
even while it's still

251
00:10:54,786 --> 00:10:56,566
But in the meantime, we're

252
00:10:56,566 --> 00:10:58,176
of what was there

253
00:10:58,756 --> 00:11:00,806
So it's important that that

254
00:10:58,756 --> 00:11:00,806
So it's important that that

255
00:11:00,806 --> 00:11:03,146
as well, so that you're

256
00:11:03,146 --> 00:11:04,226
until the app gets resumed.

257
00:11:06,056 --> 00:11:08,766
Even more importantly, if I

258
00:11:08,766 --> 00:11:10,466
and don't land on

259
00:11:10,956 --> 00:11:12,356
they're not being unsuspended

260
00:11:12,356 --> 00:11:14,266
and resumed the entire

261
00:11:14,266 --> 00:11:16,656
So we're just scrolling

262
00:11:16,656 --> 00:11:18,286
of the last snapshots

263
00:11:18,326 --> 00:11:20,976
So you definitely want to make

264
00:11:20,976 --> 00:11:23,106
up to date and displaying

265
00:11:23,106 --> 00:11:25,976
and the Background App Refresh

266
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:26,646
to do this.

267
00:11:27,846 --> 00:11:30,156
Starting off, there's actually

268
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:32,406
that you get from the

269
00:11:32,406 --> 00:11:34,796
to add any new requests

270
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,586
Now, the first one is

271
00:11:38,836 --> 00:11:40,806
If you've actually gone

272
00:11:41,276 --> 00:11:43,886
then the user has probably

273
00:11:43,886 --> 00:11:46,396
or performed some action

274
00:11:46,396 --> 00:11:48,506
to update the snapshot that

275
00:11:49,466 --> 00:11:50,706
So when the user

276
00:11:50,846 --> 00:11:53,516
the system will automatically

277
00:11:53,576 --> 00:11:55,346
to happen on your behalf.

278
00:11:56,356 --> 00:11:57,796
Now, it's really

279
00:11:57,796 --> 00:11:59,956
because there's one new

280
00:12:00,306 --> 00:12:02,976
that all of the background

281
00:12:03,236 --> 00:12:04,926
So it's just a simple

282
00:12:04,926 --> 00:12:06,556
on your WatchKit

283
00:12:06,556 --> 00:12:08,676
and it'll get called

284
00:12:08,676 --> 00:12:10,096
of these refresh

285
00:12:10,556 --> 00:12:13,686
And so the first one is the

286
00:12:13,686 --> 00:12:15,066
when your app is suspended.

287
00:12:16,806 --> 00:12:19,896
But there's also other times

288
00:12:19,896 --> 00:12:23,306
from your app, where you'll want

289
00:12:23,306 --> 00:12:24,476
that we just do it

290
00:12:25,266 --> 00:12:27,076
And the other one, which

291
00:12:27,266 --> 00:12:29,026
is after a notification

292
00:12:29,736 --> 00:12:32,796
So if the user looks at a long

293
00:12:32,796 --> 00:12:35,096
they may have seen some new

294
00:12:35,096 --> 00:12:36,276
of some new state in your app.

295
00:12:36,976 --> 00:12:38,126
If they then go into the dock

296
00:12:38,126 --> 00:12:40,246
and see something else displayed

297
00:12:40,306 --> 00:12:41,696
that would probably

298
00:12:42,686 --> 00:12:44,836
So when your notification

299
00:12:45,066 --> 00:12:47,576
the system will automatically

300
00:12:47,576 --> 00:12:49,366
task for you in that

301
00:12:49,366 --> 00:12:51,036
so that you can update

302
00:12:51,356 --> 00:12:53,856
update your complication, and

303
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:55,066
up to date and in sync.

304
00:12:55,996 --> 00:12:58,466
Of course, there are also

305
00:12:58,466 --> 00:13:00,096
to schedule updates

306
00:12:58,466 --> 00:13:00,096
to schedule updates

307
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:03,186
You know your users and you know

308
00:13:03,186 --> 00:13:04,136
where you actually just want

309
00:13:04,136 --> 00:13:06,196
to proactively be

310
00:13:06,196 --> 00:13:09,236
and there's really

311
00:13:09,646 --> 00:13:11,346
The first is going to

312
00:13:11,846 --> 00:13:14,236
The question then becomes, what

313
00:13:14,606 --> 00:13:16,166
So the first and most

314
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:18,046
in your snapshot is just

315
00:13:18,046 --> 00:13:21,406
of your app normally is,

316
00:13:21,406 --> 00:13:23,106
and it's showing exactly

317
00:13:23,106 --> 00:13:24,316
when a user goes into the app.

318
00:13:26,176 --> 00:13:27,756
But you might also

319
00:13:27,756 --> 00:13:29,936
to provide some custom

320
00:13:29,936 --> 00:13:32,126
so that it looks nicer

321
00:13:32,126 --> 00:13:34,946
to glance at and digest.

322
00:13:35,236 --> 00:13:38,846
For example, the Dexcom G5

323
00:13:38,846 --> 00:13:40,436
the most important

324
00:13:40,436 --> 00:13:42,986
about is my current

325
00:13:43,736 --> 00:13:44,936
So if I look at it in the dock,

326
00:13:44,936 --> 00:13:47,996
I'll see that highlighted really

327
00:13:48,546 --> 00:13:52,116
But when I actually go

328
00:13:52,116 --> 00:13:54,406
about more detail than

329
00:13:55,686 --> 00:13:58,146
So as I bring the app full

330
00:13:58,146 --> 00:14:01,356
and show more information

331
00:13:58,146 --> 00:14:01,356
and show more information

332
00:14:01,446 --> 00:14:03,896
displaying, in this

333
00:14:03,896 --> 00:14:05,886
of more information

334
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:09,416
Now, you don't necessarily have

335
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:11,596
in the dock snapshot, and a

336
00:14:11,596 --> 00:14:14,626
to not do that, and just have

337
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:16,776
But you do have a lot

338
00:14:16,776 --> 00:14:19,286
so if it makes sense in your app

339
00:14:19,286 --> 00:14:21,806
in the dock snapshot, just

340
00:14:21,806 --> 00:14:24,036
as you go into the

341
00:14:24,036 --> 00:14:28,146
and not really jarring

342
00:14:30,096 --> 00:14:32,556
Okay, so in addition to these

343
00:14:32,556 --> 00:14:34,976
and keeping your snapshot up

344
00:14:34,976 --> 00:14:37,746
to periodically be able to

345
00:14:37,746 --> 00:14:40,136
in the background, and

346
00:14:40,136 --> 00:14:41,276
that you would go

347
00:14:41,276 --> 00:14:43,686
Now, you might just

348
00:14:43,686 --> 00:14:46,726
out to the Internet to fetch

349
00:14:46,776 --> 00:14:49,546
that with a NSURLSession

350
00:14:51,286 --> 00:14:53,706
but there's plenty of other

351
00:14:53,706 --> 00:14:56,126
to focus on is complication

352
00:14:56,556 --> 00:14:59,176
Now, complications are visible

353
00:14:59,536 --> 00:15:01,526
so it's even more

354
00:14:59,536 --> 00:15:01,526
so it's even more

355
00:15:01,526 --> 00:15:02,736
as up to date as possible.

356
00:15:03,136 --> 00:15:05,726
So there's a kind of update

357
00:15:05,726 --> 00:15:07,206
that are on the current

358
00:15:07,596 --> 00:15:09,736
and that's the silent

359
00:15:10,556 --> 00:15:13,276
Now, these types of updates

360
00:15:13,886 --> 00:15:15,556
but they were a little

361
00:15:15,556 --> 00:15:17,036
because you couldn't

362
00:15:17,036 --> 00:15:19,336
of how many you would get

363
00:15:19,336 --> 00:15:22,426
so it was a little difficult to

364
00:15:22,426 --> 00:15:23,256
and when you would send them.

365
00:15:23,946 --> 00:15:26,196
In watchOS 3, there's

366
00:15:26,196 --> 00:15:29,096
for complication push

367
00:15:29,096 --> 00:15:30,206
that over the course of the day,

368
00:15:30,206 --> 00:15:33,146
each app on the watch face

369
00:15:34,296 --> 00:15:36,926
This is great, because it gives

370
00:15:36,926 --> 00:15:38,696
for how you want to use them

371
00:15:39,776 --> 00:15:41,836
So for example, let's

372
00:15:42,726 --> 00:15:44,336
If we just did the

373
00:15:44,336 --> 00:15:47,376
and distributed our 50

374
00:15:47,746 --> 00:15:49,776
that would give us about

375
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:53,656
And that's not too bad, but we

376
00:15:53,656 --> 00:15:56,226
into account a little bit

377
00:15:56,226 --> 00:15:59,296
that we were displaying and

378
00:16:00,416 --> 00:16:01,836
For example, let's

379
00:16:01,836 --> 00:16:04,756
that our user generally sleeps

380
00:16:06,176 --> 00:16:08,896
If that's the case, then

381
00:16:08,896 --> 00:16:11,246
to update during

382
00:16:11,246 --> 00:16:13,506
and we can distribute the

383
00:16:13,506 --> 00:16:14,376
through the rest of the day.

384
00:16:15,406 --> 00:16:17,426
So that'll increase

385
00:16:17,426 --> 00:16:20,586
to once every 20 minutes, which

386
00:16:20,586 --> 00:16:22,176
with only a small

387
00:16:23,176 --> 00:16:25,516
But of course, it we

388
00:16:25,516 --> 00:16:28,446
about the data itself and

389
00:16:29,076 --> 00:16:31,296
then we might be able to

390
00:16:31,876 --> 00:16:34,306
So let's say that we knew

391
00:16:34,306 --> 00:16:35,716
from the New York

392
00:16:36,146 --> 00:16:38,646
In that case, we'd only need

393
00:16:38,646 --> 00:16:40,366
and 4:00 p.m. when

394
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:42,526
and that would increase

395
00:16:42,526 --> 00:16:44,246
to once every eight-and-a-half

396
00:16:45,476 --> 00:16:48,046
So now, obviously, this

397
00:16:48,046 --> 00:16:50,526
to the vast majority of

398
00:16:50,526 --> 00:16:52,106
in general definitely can.

399
00:16:52,556 --> 00:16:54,906
Taking into account a little

400
00:16:54,906 --> 00:16:57,576
that you have about your user

401
00:16:57,576 --> 00:17:00,516
that you're displaying can

402
00:16:57,576 --> 00:17:00,516
that you're displaying can

403
00:17:00,616 --> 00:17:03,306
to even further enhance

404
00:17:03,306 --> 00:17:04,776
when using your app

405
00:17:06,586 --> 00:17:10,435
Okay, but those are just

406
00:17:10,435 --> 00:17:11,465
on the current watch face.

407
00:17:12,626 --> 00:17:14,106
Now, if you have an

408
00:17:14,106 --> 00:17:16,396
on the current watch

409
00:17:16,806 --> 00:17:17,986
or an app on the

410
00:17:17,986 --> 00:17:19,766
where push updates maybe

411
00:17:19,766 --> 00:17:21,996
There are other ways to

412
00:17:23,116 --> 00:17:24,685
In these cases, you'll

413
00:17:24,685 --> 00:17:27,656
to do some periodic scheduled

414
00:17:27,656 --> 00:17:32,536
over the course of the day.

415
00:17:32,776 --> 00:17:34,446
So there's another

416
00:17:34,446 --> 00:17:36,846
that will let you schedule

417
00:17:36,846 --> 00:17:40,196
like to run, and each time

418
00:17:40,196 --> 00:17:41,636
of different things that

419
00:17:42,316 --> 00:17:45,106
You could start some data

420
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:46,136
or Watch Connectivity.

421
00:17:47,256 --> 00:17:49,406
Or you could just load new

422
00:17:49,406 --> 00:17:51,796
on the watch if you already have

423
00:17:53,636 --> 00:17:55,616
But in addition to that,

424
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:57,276
to schedule the next

425
00:17:57,966 --> 00:18:01,386
So it's not a fixed period that

426
00:17:57,966 --> 00:18:01,386
So it's not a fixed period that

427
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:03,306
Each time you run, you

428
00:18:03,306 --> 00:18:05,506
to choose the next best

429
00:18:05,856 --> 00:18:08,926
so that you can optimize

430
00:18:08,926 --> 00:18:11,116
and when you know that

431
00:18:11,536 --> 00:18:14,906
Now, at a minimum,

432
00:18:14,906 --> 00:18:17,226
that your application can

433
00:18:18,266 --> 00:18:20,926
but there are some other

434
00:18:20,926 --> 00:18:23,706
to run even more

435
00:18:23,706 --> 00:18:26,706
So the first would be if

436
00:18:26,706 --> 00:18:27,896
by a complication.

437
00:18:28,276 --> 00:18:30,526
So if a complication is

438
00:18:30,816 --> 00:18:32,106
then your app will

439
00:18:32,106 --> 00:18:33,916
to update more frequently

440
00:18:34,976 --> 00:18:37,046
But even if you're not on

441
00:18:37,196 --> 00:18:39,856
you may be able to run more

442
00:18:41,346 --> 00:18:45,126
So the total number of updates

443
00:18:45,126 --> 00:18:47,126
for all of the apps that

444
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:50,136
So if the dock is full, and

445
00:18:50,386 --> 00:18:51,836
then each of the apps

446
00:18:51,836 --> 00:18:52,906
to update once an hour.

447
00:18:53,486 --> 00:18:55,186
But if the user hasn't

448
00:18:55,186 --> 00:18:56,536
and there are fewer

449
00:18:57,056 --> 00:18:59,426
the updates that would have been

450
00:18:59,426 --> 00:19:01,706
in use can be distributed

451
00:18:59,426 --> 00:19:01,706
in use can be distributed

452
00:19:02,496 --> 00:19:05,266
So in that case, you

453
00:19:05,266 --> 00:19:06,816
than one update per hour.

454
00:19:08,116 --> 00:19:11,186
Of course, as you're designed

455
00:19:11,186 --> 00:19:12,586
to plan for once an hour,

456
00:19:12,586 --> 00:19:14,256
because that's the

457
00:19:14,656 --> 00:19:16,536
But just keep in mind

458
00:19:16,536 --> 00:19:18,316
that you could be running

459
00:19:18,406 --> 00:19:19,956
depending on these

460
00:19:20,506 --> 00:19:24,726
So there's one last thing

461
00:19:24,726 --> 00:19:26,286
about complication pushes.

462
00:19:27,356 --> 00:19:30,346
Complication pushes, when you

463
00:19:30,346 --> 00:19:33,426
that may come to mind is a push

464
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:35,536
and that's definitely

465
00:19:35,536 --> 00:19:37,456
You can start a complication

466
00:19:37,456 --> 00:19:38,006
from the server.

467
00:19:38,976 --> 00:19:40,586
But what you may not

468
00:19:40,586 --> 00:19:42,746
that you can also start

469
00:19:42,746 --> 00:19:45,096
from your iPhone app running

470
00:19:46,106 --> 00:19:48,146
The push update API

471
00:19:48,146 --> 00:19:49,626
of the Watch Connectivity

472
00:19:50,036 --> 00:19:53,096
So if your app on your iPhone is

473
00:19:53,096 --> 00:19:54,786
either the user is

474
00:19:54,786 --> 00:19:57,866
or it's using some Background

475
00:19:58,276 --> 00:20:00,966
it can initiate a complication

476
00:19:58,276 --> 00:20:00,966
it can initiate a complication

477
00:20:01,406 --> 00:20:03,396
to update the UI on

478
00:20:04,756 --> 00:20:06,716
So even if you don't

479
00:20:06,716 --> 00:20:08,706
that has the knowledge

480
00:20:09,346 --> 00:20:11,656
you may actually still be

481
00:20:11,656 --> 00:20:13,346
to keep your watch

482
00:20:13,426 --> 00:20:15,056
So just something

483
00:20:15,056 --> 00:20:16,586
as you're designing

484
00:20:16,636 --> 00:20:18,496
and your refresh

485
00:20:19,566 --> 00:20:23,356
So that's just a quick summary

486
00:20:23,356 --> 00:20:27,136
and how all this stuff works,

487
00:20:27,136 --> 00:20:30,506
that it's really a critical part

488
00:20:30,856 --> 00:20:32,796
So no matter what kind of app

489
00:20:32,796 --> 00:20:35,016
for Apple Watch, I'd strongly

490
00:20:35,016 --> 00:20:38,706
out the Keeping Your Watch Up

491
00:20:38,706 --> 00:20:41,036
about Background App Refresh

492
00:20:41,036 --> 00:20:43,496
to keep your apps live,

493
00:20:45,396 --> 00:20:48,456
So next, let's talk about

494
00:20:49,026 --> 00:20:52,516
Now, as I've mentioned, we've

495
00:20:52,516 --> 00:20:56,066
of work to optimize navigation

496
00:20:56,416 --> 00:20:59,166
So the system is already really

497
00:20:59,506 --> 00:21:02,916
The next step is optimizing

498
00:20:59,506 --> 00:21:02,916
The next step is optimizing

499
00:21:03,116 --> 00:21:05,416
so that it's really fast

500
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:06,876
and actions that the users want.

501
00:21:07,876 --> 00:21:10,806
Now, there's one common

502
00:21:10,806 --> 00:21:11,676
that I want to start with.

503
00:21:12,586 --> 00:21:15,456
There's many apps that have

504
00:21:15,456 --> 00:21:16,106
to their data.

505
00:21:16,826 --> 00:21:20,046
For example, there's a

506
00:21:20,046 --> 00:21:22,956
of information on a

507
00:21:23,086 --> 00:21:25,486
In this case, I've written

508
00:21:25,486 --> 00:21:27,056
of the beverages that

509
00:21:28,196 --> 00:21:31,066
Now, if you want information

510
00:21:31,266 --> 00:21:33,886
you can tap on it, and it'll

511
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,936
So here we can see that

512
00:21:35,936 --> 00:21:36,806
of coffee so far today.

513
00:21:38,406 --> 00:21:41,476
In watchOS 2, if you wanted to

514
00:21:41,476 --> 00:21:44,056
of those other items, you

515
00:21:44,056 --> 00:21:46,196
find the other item,

516
00:21:46,196 --> 00:21:49,856
Now, that may not seem

517
00:21:50,376 --> 00:21:54,246
but given how short we're trying

518
00:21:54,456 --> 00:21:56,196
that additional time

519
00:21:56,196 --> 00:21:58,726
and forth can actually

520
00:21:59,386 --> 00:22:02,116
So in watchOS 3, you'll find

521
00:21:59,386 --> 00:22:02,116
So in watchOS 3, you'll find

522
00:22:02,116 --> 00:22:04,646
that have this kind of

523
00:22:04,646 --> 00:22:06,636
to a new style of

524
00:22:06,636 --> 00:22:09,656
where you can just use your

525
00:22:09,916 --> 00:22:12,826
to quickly scroll and page

526
00:22:13,106 --> 00:22:15,696
without having to do the back

527
00:22:16,996 --> 00:22:19,116
So if you look at, for

528
00:22:19,116 --> 00:22:20,816
or the Weather app,

529
00:22:20,816 --> 00:22:23,356
to enable this ok

530
00:22:23,356 --> 00:22:24,556
to make it really easy for you

531
00:22:24,556 --> 00:22:26,126
to adopt this in

532
00:22:26,736 --> 00:22:29,696
So the WatchKit table interface

533
00:22:29,696 --> 00:22:34,126
to enable this vertical paging

534
00:22:34,126 --> 00:22:37,356
into a detail view, and it's

535
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:38,916
There's just a couple of

536
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:41,836
First, obviously you can enable

537
00:22:42,786 --> 00:22:44,426
But then you also

538
00:22:44,426 --> 00:22:46,386
that in your storyboard

539
00:22:46,386 --> 00:22:48,746
to represent the

540
00:22:48,746 --> 00:22:49,926
into the detail views.

541
00:22:50,476 --> 00:22:53,256
By doing that, you give WatchKit

542
00:22:53,256 --> 00:22:56,036
to be able to pre-generate

543
00:22:56,036 --> 00:22:58,876
and place them in a

544
00:22:59,146 --> 00:23:01,786
so that it can move

545
00:22:59,146 --> 00:23:01,786
so that it can move

546
00:23:01,896 --> 00:23:04,096
So not too much adoption,

547
00:23:04,096 --> 00:23:07,086
The only other thing to keep in

548
00:23:07,716 --> 00:23:11,506
to match this, you also need

549
00:23:11,506 --> 00:23:13,946
of your detail views

550
00:23:13,946 --> 00:23:16,046
of the detail view

551
00:23:16,806 --> 00:23:19,876
If the actual detail view

552
00:23:20,146 --> 00:23:22,646
then that scrolling in the

553
00:23:22,646 --> 00:23:25,516
over the outer paging interface.

554
00:23:26,026 --> 00:23:27,506
So you definitely want to focus

555
00:23:27,506 --> 00:23:30,236
on simplifying the views

556
00:23:30,526 --> 00:23:32,706
You'll find, again, in the

557
00:23:32,706 --> 00:23:34,216
that these views now, while

558
00:23:34,216 --> 00:23:36,616
in watchOS 2 they scrolled

559
00:23:36,616 --> 00:23:39,366
of information in them, are now

560
00:23:39,366 --> 00:23:42,626
so that they can easily

561
00:23:44,636 --> 00:23:47,496
Okay, so we've gotten our

562
00:23:48,126 --> 00:23:50,626
We've optimized the background

563
00:23:50,626 --> 00:23:53,496
up to date, and we've

564
00:23:53,496 --> 00:23:54,456
within our app as well.

565
00:23:55,246 --> 00:23:58,506
The last part of ensuring

566
00:23:58,506 --> 00:24:00,926
with Apple Watch are short

567
00:23:58,506 --> 00:24:00,926
with Apple Watch are short

568
00:24:00,926 --> 00:24:02,536
out of our app as

569
00:24:03,236 --> 00:24:04,496
And of course, on Apple Watch,

570
00:24:04,496 --> 00:24:05,806
that means giving

571
00:24:05,806 --> 00:24:06,886
that they can drop their wrists.

572
00:24:08,256 --> 00:24:10,196
So there's a number of ways that

573
00:24:10,196 --> 00:24:12,046
Let's just take one

574
00:24:12,656 --> 00:24:16,086
Let's say that I've got an app

575
00:24:17,196 --> 00:24:19,396
When I tap this Buy

576
00:24:19,396 --> 00:24:22,036
and do some network activity

577
00:24:22,036 --> 00:24:23,906
to perform some actions

578
00:24:23,906 --> 00:24:25,396
or not I can actually

579
00:24:25,906 --> 00:24:27,036
Now, that might take a while.

580
00:24:27,566 --> 00:24:29,066
So my first inclination might be

581
00:24:29,066 --> 00:24:31,946
to display an indeterminate

582
00:24:31,946 --> 00:24:33,566
letting them know that

583
00:24:33,836 --> 00:24:35,216
but I'm not sure how

584
00:24:35,936 --> 00:24:37,946
Now, unfortunately, that means

585
00:24:37,946 --> 00:24:39,876
with their arm up, waiting

586
00:24:39,876 --> 00:24:41,686
until this task finishes.

587
00:24:42,356 --> 00:24:44,966
But if I'm really confident

588
00:24:44,966 --> 00:24:46,996
of the time the task

589
00:24:47,456 --> 00:24:49,016
I'm not actually

590
00:24:49,016 --> 00:24:50,476
by having them sit

591
00:24:51,326 --> 00:24:52,826
So instead, you could decide

592
00:24:52,826 --> 00:24:55,706
that you could present

593
00:24:56,026 --> 00:24:57,176
that really gives

594
00:24:57,176 --> 00:24:59,426
that you're taking care

595
00:24:59,426 --> 00:25:00,486
to wait for it to occur.

596
00:24:59,426 --> 00:25:00,486
to wait for it to occur.

597
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:02,516
So in this case, I've

598
00:25:02,766 --> 00:25:03,636
We're working on your order."

599
00:25:04,136 --> 00:25:08,236
Once they read that, they have

600
00:25:08,236 --> 00:25:11,906
their wrist, and you can

601
00:25:11,996 --> 00:25:13,116
in the background for up

602
00:25:13,116 --> 00:25:16,146
to 30 seconds using the

603
00:25:16,146 --> 00:25:17,366
on NSProcessInfo.

604
00:25:19,156 --> 00:25:21,696
Generally, everything

605
00:25:21,696 --> 00:25:22,686
to get their attention back.

606
00:25:23,106 --> 00:25:25,836
Now, of course, sometimes

607
00:25:26,106 --> 00:25:27,556
Maybe your server's

608
00:25:27,556 --> 00:25:28,666
or there's some other issue.

609
00:25:29,266 --> 00:25:33,476
In that case, watchOS 3 includes

610
00:25:33,476 --> 00:25:36,646
framework that lets you

611
00:25:36,646 --> 00:25:39,396
on the watch itself,

612
00:25:39,436 --> 00:25:40,996
during this background

613
00:25:40,996 --> 00:25:42,546
to get the user's

614
00:25:42,786 --> 00:25:45,796
let them know something went

615
00:25:45,796 --> 00:25:46,736
to fix it really easily.

616
00:25:47,956 --> 00:25:49,996
So in this case, let's

617
00:25:49,996 --> 00:25:51,846
my order of chicken

618
00:25:52,216 --> 00:25:54,806
I can pop up a notification,

619
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:58,076
Of course, because notifications

620
00:25:58,306 --> 00:26:00,156
I can have some buttons

621
00:25:58,306 --> 00:26:00,156
I can have some buttons

622
00:26:00,156 --> 00:26:02,766
to resolve the issue, or I

623
00:26:02,766 --> 00:26:06,796
into my app so that they can fix

624
00:26:06,796 --> 00:26:09,456
The User Notification framework

625
00:26:09,456 --> 00:26:12,986
but of course, it's not just for

626
00:26:13,476 --> 00:26:15,346
Local notifications can

627
00:26:15,346 --> 00:26:16,746
for many different

628
00:26:17,536 --> 00:26:19,676
And the great thing about the

629
00:26:19,676 --> 00:26:21,936
in watchOS 3 is that it can work

630
00:26:21,936 --> 00:26:23,536
when the watch is

631
00:26:23,536 --> 00:26:25,076
because it's scheduling

632
00:26:25,076 --> 00:26:26,076
on the watch itself.

633
00:26:27,096 --> 00:26:29,246
But now you do have a choice

634
00:26:29,276 --> 00:26:32,066
because you can either use the

635
00:26:32,066 --> 00:26:33,926
on the watch to schedule

636
00:26:34,276 --> 00:26:36,946
or you can continue doing what

637
00:26:37,376 --> 00:26:38,866
sending a message

638
00:26:38,866 --> 00:26:41,216
with Watch Connectivity and

639
00:26:42,076 --> 00:26:44,536
These are actually both

640
00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:45,576
and it depends a little bit

641
00:26:45,576 --> 00:26:46,926
on what you're trying

642
00:26:48,176 --> 00:26:49,416
The important distinction is

643
00:26:49,416 --> 00:26:50,806
where the notifications

644
00:26:51,496 --> 00:26:53,706
So if you send a message

645
00:26:53,836 --> 00:26:56,046
with Watch Connectivity, and

646
00:26:56,656 --> 00:26:59,256
the notification will appear on

647
00:26:59,556 --> 00:27:01,726
and you'll be notified on

648
00:26:59,556 --> 00:27:01,726
and you'll be notified on

649
00:27:01,726 --> 00:27:05,116
So if you were using your

650
00:27:05,176 --> 00:27:07,396
If you're using your watch,

651
00:27:08,256 --> 00:27:10,536
If you use the new User

652
00:27:10,536 --> 00:27:14,236
on the watch itself, that

653
00:27:14,236 --> 00:27:16,736
on the watch and will not

654
00:27:17,756 --> 00:27:20,376
Now, that actually might

655
00:27:20,376 --> 00:27:22,266
There are many cases

656
00:27:22,266 --> 00:27:24,296
to schedule a notification

657
00:27:24,296 --> 00:27:27,406
up on the watch at all, and

658
00:27:27,486 --> 00:27:28,986
with the new User

659
00:27:29,986 --> 00:27:31,516
But even better is

660
00:27:36,836 --> 00:27:37,486
Thanks. But even better,

661
00:27:37,486 --> 00:27:39,356
you don't necessarily

662
00:27:39,726 --> 00:27:42,526
If your goal is that you want

663
00:27:42,526 --> 00:27:43,966
in the right spot,

664
00:27:44,266 --> 00:27:46,806
even if the user leaves their

665
00:27:46,806 --> 00:27:49,576
to schedule it in both places

666
00:27:49,576 --> 00:27:51,126
to send a message

667
00:27:51,126 --> 00:27:54,086
and scheduling it there, or

668
00:27:54,086 --> 00:27:55,446
in your cloud service,

669
00:27:55,516 --> 00:27:56,676
by default, schedule it there.

670
00:27:57,286 --> 00:27:59,906
And also scheduling it with the

671
00:27:59,986 --> 00:28:00,706
on the watch.

672
00:27:59,986 --> 00:28:00,706
on the watch.

673
00:28:01,436 --> 00:28:02,526
If you do that, as long

674
00:28:02,526 --> 00:28:05,766
as you've used the same

675
00:28:05,766 --> 00:28:06,706
times that you schedule it,

676
00:28:07,306 --> 00:28:09,466
watchOS will de-duplicate

677
00:28:09,466 --> 00:28:12,476
so that you only have it appear

678
00:28:13,026 --> 00:28:16,246
So some great new stuff with

679
00:28:19,416 --> 00:28:21,936
Now, while individual

680
00:28:21,936 --> 00:28:24,856
with the watch are short, there

681
00:28:24,856 --> 00:28:27,306
to use multiple times

682
00:28:28,086 --> 00:28:30,226
For example, here I've got

683
00:28:30,226 --> 00:28:31,276
and I'm going to

684
00:28:31,276 --> 00:28:32,496
up all the items

685
00:28:33,886 --> 00:28:37,446
Now, in watchOS 3, each time I

686
00:28:37,506 --> 00:28:39,136
to the last app that I was used

687
00:28:39,566 --> 00:28:42,926
to that I can really quickly

688
00:28:42,926 --> 00:28:45,136
to pick up, and check off the

689
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:49,676
I'll be brought back

690
00:28:49,676 --> 00:28:51,566
to eight minutes

691
00:28:52,466 --> 00:28:54,686
This is great, because

692
00:28:54,686 --> 00:28:56,376
that have this kind of

693
00:28:56,376 --> 00:28:59,156
where you use it for

694
00:28:59,156 --> 00:29:00,716
but over a longer

695
00:28:59,156 --> 00:29:00,716
but over a longer

696
00:29:01,396 --> 00:29:04,746
This is the new user default

697
00:29:04,746 --> 00:29:06,566
so it's to plan for this

698
00:29:06,786 --> 00:29:09,106
and build your apps

699
00:29:10,516 --> 00:29:13,876
These are just a few of the

700
00:29:13,876 --> 00:29:16,776
about improving app

701
00:29:17,576 --> 00:29:19,686
and there's a ton of other ways.

702
00:29:19,776 --> 00:29:22,136
I'd encourage you to check out

703
00:29:22,136 --> 00:29:24,906
for watchOS session, where you

704
00:29:24,906 --> 00:29:27,866
of these kinds of ideas and

705
00:29:28,446 --> 00:29:31,586
So that's navigation.

706
00:29:32,726 --> 00:29:33,896
Now let's talk a little bit more

707
00:29:33,896 --> 00:29:37,156
about the enhanced API

708
00:29:41,236 --> 00:29:43,336
As I mentioned earlier,

709
00:29:43,336 --> 00:29:45,646
of great frameworks from

710
00:29:45,886 --> 00:29:47,456
We've got some great

711
00:29:47,456 --> 00:29:49,316
For example, the User

712
00:29:49,736 --> 00:29:52,646
and we've also added a

713
00:29:52,646 --> 00:29:55,066
of the frameworks that are

714
00:29:56,476 --> 00:29:58,616
So let's start with one

715
00:29:59,296 --> 00:30:00,346
Background App Refresh.

716
00:29:59,296 --> 00:30:00,346
Background App Refresh.

717
00:30:00,476 --> 00:30:02,146
I wanted to bring

718
00:30:02,146 --> 00:30:04,876
to reinforce how important

719
00:30:05,466 --> 00:30:08,596
And the three key things that

720
00:30:08,596 --> 00:30:12,856
to schedule updates, perform

721
00:30:12,856 --> 00:30:15,566
with that guarantee of 50

722
00:30:16,406 --> 00:30:18,856
and make sure that your snapshot

723
00:30:18,856 --> 00:30:20,996
and in sync with

724
00:30:21,286 --> 00:30:22,496
and your complications.

725
00:30:23,926 --> 00:30:26,186
Again, definitely check out

726
00:30:26,186 --> 00:30:31,316
Up to Date session as well for

727
00:30:31,536 --> 00:30:34,806
Now, fitness apps have a unique

728
00:30:35,246 --> 00:30:37,446
because during a workout

729
00:30:37,446 --> 00:30:40,316
that they be displaying

730
00:30:40,316 --> 00:30:41,546
to date throughout the workout.

731
00:30:42,166 --> 00:30:45,036
So the big enhancement for

732
00:30:45,036 --> 00:30:47,506
in watchOS 3, they will continue

733
00:30:47,506 --> 00:30:50,286
for the entire duration

734
00:30:50,826 --> 00:30:54,816
This gives you the opportunity

735
00:30:55,136 --> 00:30:58,616
watch-- use all of the

736
00:30:58,616 --> 00:30:59,506
of where things are going,

737
00:30:59,506 --> 00:31:01,806
and notify the user

738
00:30:59,506 --> 00:31:01,806
and notify the user

739
00:31:01,806 --> 00:31:03,296
or haptics, or sounds.

740
00:31:04,576 --> 00:31:07,166
And of course, we've enhanced

741
00:31:07,386 --> 00:31:11,146
and accelerometer so they

742
00:31:11,146 --> 00:31:14,476
throughout the entire workout,

743
00:31:14,476 --> 00:31:16,616
in increments that are

744
00:31:17,236 --> 00:31:19,926
So it makes it really easy to

745
00:31:19,926 --> 00:31:22,856
of the workout the entire

746
00:31:23,776 --> 00:31:26,126
Because they're running,

747
00:31:26,416 --> 00:31:28,996
which makes sure that as

748
00:31:28,996 --> 00:31:31,326
they can very quickly see

749
00:31:31,326 --> 00:31:33,356
of the workout without

750
00:31:34,816 --> 00:31:37,526
It's a really, really big year,

751
00:31:37,526 --> 00:31:40,226
and there's an entire session

752
00:31:40,226 --> 00:31:42,766
of other enhancements for

753
00:31:42,766 --> 00:31:45,646
out Building Great Workout

754
00:31:45,646 --> 00:31:48,386
to make your workout apps

755
00:31:50,236 --> 00:31:51,446
But there is one

756
00:31:51,446 --> 00:31:52,816
on a little bit more here first,

757
00:31:52,816 --> 00:31:54,176
and that's the background

758
00:31:54,736 --> 00:31:57,606
Because there's a bit of

759
00:31:58,086 --> 00:31:59,786
you absolutely want

760
00:31:59,786 --> 00:32:01,446
up to date during the workout.

761
00:31:59,786 --> 00:32:01,446
up to date during the workout.

762
00:32:01,996 --> 00:32:03,236
But you also want to make sure

763
00:32:03,236 --> 00:32:04,956
that you're preserving

764
00:32:04,956 --> 00:32:07,916
for users throughout the rest

765
00:32:07,916 --> 00:32:09,256
to preserve their battery life.

766
00:32:10,616 --> 00:32:12,996
And a big components

767
00:32:12,996 --> 00:32:14,976
that you're keeping track

768
00:32:14,976 --> 00:32:16,356
that you're using

769
00:32:17,486 --> 00:32:20,176
And Xcode now has a great

770
00:32:20,176 --> 00:32:22,676
of that, both how much

771
00:32:23,196 --> 00:32:25,496
and the amount that

772
00:32:25,496 --> 00:32:28,186
over a period of time.

773
00:32:28,386 --> 00:32:30,916
So for the first part,

774
00:32:30,916 --> 00:32:33,636
right up here near the top, that

775
00:32:33,636 --> 00:32:36,566
that you're currently using,

776
00:32:36,566 --> 00:32:39,666
there's a great graph that shows

777
00:32:40,006 --> 00:32:41,756
about the CPU usage over time.

778
00:32:43,646 --> 00:32:45,566
Now, you can clearly

779
00:32:45,566 --> 00:32:46,776
where we've been

780
00:32:47,416 --> 00:32:49,216
But in yellow, in

781
00:32:49,216 --> 00:32:51,526
you can see that we've got a

782
00:32:51,526 --> 00:32:54,266
of CPU that's being consumed

783
00:32:54,266 --> 00:32:55,366
over some period of time.

784
00:32:55,966 --> 00:32:57,566
Now this part is the

785
00:32:57,566 --> 00:32:58,556
and it's the most important,

786
00:32:59,006 --> 00:33:01,206
because while your workout app

787
00:32:59,006 --> 00:33:01,206
because while your workout app

788
00:33:01,626 --> 00:33:04,746
there's a cap imposed

789
00:33:04,746 --> 00:33:06,836
of average CPU usage

790
00:33:06,836 --> 00:33:07,936
over this period of time.

791
00:33:08,446 --> 00:33:10,756
And you want to stay below

792
00:33:11,056 --> 00:33:12,906
that your app continues

793
00:33:12,906 --> 00:33:14,636
and preserves the

794
00:33:14,636 --> 00:33:15,916
over the whole rest of the day.

795
00:33:17,596 --> 00:33:20,176
So that cap here is

796
00:33:20,176 --> 00:33:22,406
by the red dotted

797
00:33:22,406 --> 00:33:24,706
as your average approaches

798
00:33:24,706 --> 00:33:25,506
that you stay below it.

799
00:33:26,906 --> 00:33:28,916
So there's, again,

800
00:33:28,916 --> 00:33:31,576
about the background

801
00:33:31,576 --> 00:33:32,226
improvements.

802
00:33:32,226 --> 00:33:34,466
Definitely go check out more of

803
00:33:34,466 --> 00:33:37,186
that you really should keep

804
00:33:37,376 --> 00:33:38,656
as you're developing these apps.

805
00:33:39,246 --> 00:33:43,096
So in addition to the sensor

806
00:33:43,096 --> 00:33:44,416
of apps with making heart rate

807
00:33:44,416 --> 00:33:46,486
and accelerometer

808
00:33:46,786 --> 00:33:50,006
we've also got a bunch of

809
00:33:50,646 --> 00:33:53,506
So crown events give you raw

810
00:33:53,506 --> 00:33:54,506
from the digital crown.

811
00:33:55,596 --> 00:33:59,036
In watchOS 2, your apps could

812
00:33:59,036 --> 00:34:02,446
within your interface or for

813
00:33:59,036 --> 00:34:02,446
within your interface or for

814
00:34:02,446 --> 00:34:03,286
with the picker control.

815
00:34:03,916 --> 00:34:07,336
But of course, we saw

816
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:10,396
of the picker control for

817
00:34:10,676 --> 00:34:13,315
and we realize that everybody,

818
00:34:13,315 --> 00:34:14,326
to digital crown events.

819
00:34:14,556 --> 00:34:16,716
So that's now available, and

820
00:34:16,716 --> 00:34:18,466
of other interactions

821
00:34:19,676 --> 00:34:19,755
Now--

822
00:34:20,516 --> 00:34:24,676
[ Applause ]

823
00:34:25,176 --> 00:34:28,045
Now just gesture recognizers

824
00:34:28,306 --> 00:34:30,755
to add touch interactions

825
00:34:31,156 --> 00:34:32,616
There's a whole bunch

826
00:34:32,616 --> 00:34:37,106
of single-finger interactions

827
00:34:37,106 --> 00:34:40,346
long-press, and it's really

828
00:34:40,346 --> 00:34:42,136
of your different

829
00:34:42,436 --> 00:34:43,985
so that you can have

830
00:34:43,985 --> 00:34:46,346
of your app screen

831
00:34:47,246 --> 00:34:49,626
And of course, we've also made

832
00:34:49,626 --> 00:34:50,926
in addition to the

833
00:34:51,235 --> 00:34:53,186
so you've got a ton of

834
00:34:53,186 --> 00:34:56,436
of the device available for all

835
00:34:57,706 --> 00:34:58,726
Again, the quick-- oop.

836
00:34:59,066 --> 00:34:59,816
Go for it [clapping].

837
00:35:02,556 --> 00:35:04,736
Again, the quick interaction

838
00:35:04,736 --> 00:35:07,026
of information on this

839
00:35:07,526 --> 00:35:09,456
I do want to give you a

840
00:35:09,456 --> 00:35:11,076
of the cool things that you

841
00:35:12,006 --> 00:35:15,436
So first off, you can see here

842
00:35:15,926 --> 00:35:18,326
to let you quickly scrub

843
00:35:18,326 --> 00:35:21,986
on a graph showing you

844
00:35:22,356 --> 00:35:23,166
about your account.

845
00:35:23,876 --> 00:35:26,146
So in a single simple

846
00:35:26,146 --> 00:35:28,926
through a lot of information,

847
00:35:31,376 --> 00:35:34,706
Here we have Sweat with Kayla,

848
00:35:34,776 --> 00:35:38,566
of the swipe gestures to

849
00:35:38,566 --> 00:35:40,066
between these different workouts

850
00:35:40,066 --> 00:35:41,426
and choose just the

851
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:44,576
Of course, you can also use

852
00:35:44,576 --> 00:35:47,086
between them, and with just a

853
00:35:47,086 --> 00:35:47,876
that you're interested in.

854
00:35:48,936 --> 00:35:50,016
Now you'll notice

855
00:35:50,016 --> 00:35:51,226
of interesting visuals here

856
00:35:51,226 --> 00:35:54,026
that are adding a little

857
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:56,636
And to help make that

858
00:35:56,876 --> 00:35:58,816
we've got some great

859
00:35:58,816 --> 00:36:00,236
that we've bought

860
00:35:58,816 --> 00:36:00,236
that we've bought

861
00:36:00,906 --> 00:36:04,186
SpriteKit and SceneKit make

862
00:36:04,186 --> 00:36:06,316
and 3D graphics and animations

863
00:36:06,576 --> 00:36:08,176
to enhance different

864
00:36:08,746 --> 00:36:10,006
And of course you can use them

865
00:36:10,006 --> 00:36:13,436
in your long look

866
00:36:13,756 --> 00:36:16,676
to make your notifications

867
00:36:18,446 --> 00:36:19,816
And because we've

868
00:36:19,816 --> 00:36:22,776
about simplifying navigation, we

869
00:36:22,776 --> 00:36:24,216
to play back video in line

870
00:36:24,216 --> 00:36:25,976
in your application

871
00:36:26,876 --> 00:36:29,966
In watchOS 2, we introduced

872
00:36:30,476 --> 00:36:32,416
but for it to work there,

873
00:36:32,416 --> 00:36:34,276
out into a separate

874
00:36:34,276 --> 00:36:35,276
where you watched a video

875
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:36,616
and then dismissed it

876
00:36:37,176 --> 00:36:38,826
With inline video

877
00:36:38,826 --> 00:36:41,166
to leave your application's

878
00:36:41,226 --> 00:36:42,696
and you can play it

879
00:36:43,346 --> 00:36:45,376
Even better, it supports

880
00:36:45,656 --> 00:36:48,066
so as soon as the video

881
00:36:48,066 --> 00:36:50,376
it will start playing and

882
00:36:50,826 --> 00:36:53,566
If you have multiple short

883
00:36:53,566 --> 00:36:55,886
the one on screen at any one

884
00:36:55,886 --> 00:36:57,306
while all the others pause.

885
00:36:57,816 --> 00:36:58,836
It's a really great way

886
00:36:58,836 --> 00:37:00,666
to add some really

887
00:36:58,836 --> 00:37:00,666
to add some really

888
00:37:00,666 --> 00:37:01,496
into your apps.

889
00:37:02,156 --> 00:37:04,966
And because apps in the dock are

890
00:37:05,586 --> 00:37:07,656
the autoplay feature can

891
00:37:08,046 --> 00:37:10,766
So if you have a quick video

892
00:37:10,766 --> 00:37:13,116
as you scroll through the

893
00:37:13,116 --> 00:37:15,666
on your app, that video can

894
00:37:15,666 --> 00:37:17,256
without even taking

895
00:37:17,896 --> 00:37:19,216
So some really great

896
00:37:19,216 --> 00:37:20,446
for video in watchOS 3.

897
00:37:20,826 --> 00:37:25,596
SpriteKit and SceneKit can be

898
00:37:25,646 --> 00:37:28,656
Here you can see a Seven

899
00:37:28,656 --> 00:37:32,256
advantage of SceneKit to bring a

900
00:37:32,256 --> 00:37:34,486
on their iPhone app to

901
00:37:35,126 --> 00:37:37,286
So you can see exactly the

902
00:37:37,356 --> 00:37:40,736
and get a lot of clarity

903
00:37:41,246 --> 00:37:43,986
So in addition to adding a

904
00:37:43,986 --> 00:37:47,016
to your apps, SpriteKit and

905
00:37:47,016 --> 00:37:48,506
for short interaction games.

906
00:37:50,296 --> 00:37:53,226
We've also bought GameKit to

907
00:37:53,726 --> 00:37:55,066
which makes it really

908
00:37:55,066 --> 00:37:58,126
to add turn-based gaming

909
00:37:59,396 --> 00:38:01,996
Because GameKit's turn-based

910
00:37:59,396 --> 00:38:01,996
Because GameKit's turn-based

911
00:38:01,996 --> 00:38:04,236
of NSURLSession,

912
00:38:04,236 --> 00:38:05,286
if your phone is not present,

913
00:38:05,286 --> 00:38:07,246
when your watch is near

914
00:38:09,586 --> 00:38:12,306
The GameKit achievement

915
00:38:12,306 --> 00:38:15,356
to earn achievements on Apple

916
00:38:15,356 --> 00:38:18,506
on iPhone, or iPad, or

917
00:38:18,506 --> 00:38:19,206
where you've got your game.

918
00:38:19,756 --> 00:38:23,156
And of course, with AV

919
00:38:23,156 --> 00:38:25,266
to play sounds out

920
00:38:25,866 --> 00:38:30,456
Now, gaming on Apple Watch is

921
00:38:30,456 --> 00:38:32,796
and with some of these new

922
00:38:32,796 --> 00:38:34,506
to see what kinds of

923
00:38:34,856 --> 00:38:37,016
for short interaction

924
00:38:37,556 --> 00:38:40,036
To give you just one idea

925
00:38:40,036 --> 00:38:41,996
in a really interesting game,

926
00:38:42,326 --> 00:38:46,086
I want to show you a quick

927
00:38:46,086 --> 00:38:48,216
that WoGa is developing

928
00:38:49,286 --> 00:38:51,666
that lets us go fishing at

929
00:38:52,186 --> 00:38:55,116
So with just a swipe,

930
00:38:55,116 --> 00:38:57,646
and I can use the digital

931
00:38:57,646 --> 00:38:59,336
down to just the right

932
00:38:59,336 --> 00:39:03,146
Now, I could leave it there for

933
00:38:59,336 --> 00:39:03,146
Now, I could leave it there for

934
00:39:03,146 --> 00:39:04,066
to go fishing right now.

935
00:39:04,736 --> 00:39:05,526
Looks like I got a bite.

936
00:39:06,146 --> 00:39:08,226
Now you can use the crown

937
00:39:08,606 --> 00:39:10,886
but now I actually--

938
00:39:11,266 --> 00:39:13,126
That'll probably make the

939
00:39:13,456 --> 00:39:16,376
although our fisherman might

940
00:39:17,586 --> 00:39:21,636
So really cool how you can add

941
00:39:21,636 --> 00:39:24,996
and get some great animations

942
00:39:25,336 --> 00:39:27,296
Really, really looking

943
00:39:27,296 --> 00:39:28,986
of things you guys do with this.

944
00:39:30,566 --> 00:39:32,536
So next up, I want

945
00:39:33,906 --> 00:39:35,856
We've brought CloudKit

946
00:39:36,106 --> 00:39:39,346
including the new CK Share

947
00:39:40,236 --> 00:39:42,466
to share data between

948
00:39:42,836 --> 00:39:46,246
Again, because it's built on an

949
00:39:46,246 --> 00:39:48,326
for it to work, even when

950
00:39:48,326 --> 00:39:51,316
There's a whole session on

951
00:39:51,316 --> 00:39:55,096
in CloudKit that I definitely

952
00:39:56,576 --> 00:39:58,016
And finally, we've

953
00:39:58,106 --> 00:40:00,956
Apple Watch is a great way

954
00:39:58,106 --> 00:40:00,956
Apple Watch is a great way

955
00:40:00,956 --> 00:40:03,906
in stores, and of course with

956
00:40:04,086 --> 00:40:07,136
you can now offer physical goods

957
00:40:07,406 --> 00:40:09,016
with just a double tap

958
00:40:09,016 --> 00:40:12,186
Now, there's many different

959
00:40:12,186 --> 00:40:15,846
about using this, but for

960
00:40:16,206 --> 00:40:19,636
to offer for purchase the most

961
00:40:19,636 --> 00:40:22,626
for lunch, so that I can

962
00:40:22,626 --> 00:40:24,706
at lunchtime every day,

963
00:40:25,226 --> 00:40:27,106
There's a lot of ways that

964
00:40:27,106 --> 00:40:28,926
for sale within your

965
00:40:29,526 --> 00:40:32,576
So that's just some of the APIs

966
00:40:32,966 --> 00:40:35,166
that are a part of

967
00:40:35,166 --> 00:40:36,936
There's a bunch of

968
00:40:36,936 --> 00:40:38,876
Definitely go check it all out.

969
00:40:39,716 --> 00:40:41,966
I'd like to end by talking

970
00:40:41,966 --> 00:40:43,956
and configuration,

971
00:40:44,016 --> 00:40:46,016
building a great watch app

972
00:40:46,366 --> 00:40:48,946
You also want to make sure

973
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:50,736
to discover it and

974
00:40:51,546 --> 00:40:54,226
So the first enhancement

975
00:40:54,226 --> 00:40:57,006
in the iOS 10 Apple Watch app.

976
00:40:57,736 --> 00:41:00,556
There's a brand new watch face

977
00:40:57,736 --> 00:41:00,556
There's a brand new watch face

978
00:41:00,556 --> 00:41:02,926
of the watch faces that

979
00:41:03,546 --> 00:41:05,716
And even better, right

980
00:41:05,716 --> 00:41:08,546
it includes an entire

981
00:41:08,546 --> 00:41:11,546
of your apps, and getting

982
00:41:11,546 --> 00:41:13,136
and requires just

983
00:41:14,046 --> 00:41:17,476
So first off, you have to

984
00:41:18,776 --> 00:41:20,866
You already had an

985
00:41:20,866 --> 00:41:23,016
for specifying a template

986
00:41:24,406 --> 00:41:26,546
This API has been in

987
00:41:26,926 --> 00:41:30,856
to not just return a string

988
00:41:31,166 --> 00:41:33,186
but actually the

989
00:41:33,436 --> 00:41:35,726
to get localized strings

990
00:41:36,426 --> 00:41:38,396
This is important,

991
00:41:38,396 --> 00:41:40,296
to build a complication bundle.

992
00:41:40,796 --> 00:41:43,126
You use the-- you do

993
00:41:43,756 --> 00:41:46,246
You run your app, and build

994
00:41:46,246 --> 00:41:48,186
and this creates a

995
00:41:48,356 --> 00:41:49,626
of your complication template

996
00:41:49,626 --> 00:41:52,706
that you can then include

997
00:41:52,966 --> 00:41:54,896
It's really easy to

998
00:41:54,946 --> 00:41:58,866
it gets you into this gallery

999
00:41:59,976 --> 00:42:01,436
We need the static

1000
00:41:59,976 --> 00:42:01,436
We need the static

1001
00:42:01,436 --> 00:42:03,856
because that way we can display

1002
00:42:03,856 --> 00:42:06,066
in a watch face here,

1003
00:42:06,066 --> 00:42:07,496
yet installed on the watch.

1004
00:42:08,446 --> 00:42:11,396
So just a couple of steps,

1005
00:42:11,396 --> 00:42:13,336
You'll be right here

1006
00:42:14,016 --> 00:42:16,506
The gallery is the first thing

1007
00:42:16,506 --> 00:42:19,496
after they've paired, so

1008
00:42:19,496 --> 00:42:21,376
that you'll want to be.

1009
00:42:21,726 --> 00:42:24,286
In addition to the gallery,

1010
00:42:24,286 --> 00:42:26,876
to customize watch faces

1011
00:42:27,326 --> 00:42:29,476
It was always possible to

1012
00:42:29,476 --> 00:42:33,056
on the Apple Watch, and in

1013
00:42:33,056 --> 00:42:36,396
on iPhone now includes an entire

1014
00:42:36,786 --> 00:42:38,906
Obviously, they're kept in

1015
00:42:38,906 --> 00:42:42,706
in one will be reflected in the

1016
00:42:42,706 --> 00:42:45,226
on your phone to select all

1017
00:42:45,226 --> 00:42:48,116
like on all your watch

1018
00:42:48,626 --> 00:42:50,216
And with quick watch

1019
00:42:50,506 --> 00:42:53,816
there's now even more reason

1020
00:42:54,096 --> 00:42:56,486
because more users will

1021
00:42:56,816 --> 00:42:58,426
and your apps can

1022
00:42:59,026 --> 00:43:02,736
So then the last part of

1023
00:42:59,026 --> 00:43:02,736
So then the last part of

1024
00:43:03,176 --> 00:43:05,616
and obviously, you

1025
00:43:05,616 --> 00:43:07,116
in the Apple Watch

1026
00:43:07,396 --> 00:43:10,146
It's really easy to add and

1027
00:43:10,146 --> 00:43:11,176
and reorder them right there.

1028
00:43:11,866 --> 00:43:14,546
But even more importantly, you

1029
00:43:14,616 --> 00:43:16,596
And there's one feature

1030
00:43:16,596 --> 00:43:18,596
that makes it really

1031
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:20,206
that you can add

1032
00:43:20,856 --> 00:43:24,086
The last app that you used is

1033
00:43:24,086 --> 00:43:25,836
even if you hadn't

1034
00:43:26,286 --> 00:43:29,426
So if a user installs your

1035
00:43:29,426 --> 00:43:30,786
that they can add

1036
00:43:31,156 --> 00:43:33,396
they go to the home screen, they

1037
00:43:33,736 --> 00:43:35,696
The next time they go to the

1038
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:38,536
in there with a big button

1039
00:43:38,946 --> 00:43:40,416
which, with one tab, will add it

1040
00:43:40,416 --> 00:43:41,956
to their permanent list

1041
00:43:42,706 --> 00:43:45,216
So it's really easy to discover

1042
00:43:45,376 --> 00:43:47,626
and also easy to add them

1043
00:43:48,086 --> 00:43:53,426
So again, you're going to hear

1044
00:43:53,716 --> 00:43:55,596
actionable, and responsive apps,

1045
00:43:56,216 --> 00:43:58,256
and I really do encourage

1046
00:43:58,706 --> 00:44:00,736
There's a great design

1047
00:43:58,706 --> 00:44:00,736
There's a great design

1048
00:44:00,806 --> 00:44:04,936
that you can go check out for

1049
00:44:04,936 --> 00:44:06,946
Experiences, where

1050
00:44:06,946 --> 00:44:09,176
about all these things, so

1051
00:44:09,686 --> 00:44:13,316
And the responsive part

1052
00:44:13,496 --> 00:44:15,976
that there are really two

1053
00:44:16,156 --> 00:44:18,386
with Architecting for

1054
00:44:18,796 --> 00:44:20,186
and Keeping Your

1055
00:44:20,766 --> 00:44:22,266
These are two that you'll

1056
00:44:22,266 --> 00:44:24,816
out to get all the benefits

1057
00:44:25,086 --> 00:44:26,816
and making sure that

1058
00:44:26,816 --> 00:44:28,466
and responsive for watchOS 3.

1059
00:44:28,806 --> 00:44:30,256
And there's a whole bunch

1060
00:44:30,256 --> 00:44:32,666
of other sessions throughout

1061
00:44:32,666 --> 00:44:35,696
of information, many focused on

1062
00:44:35,696 --> 00:44:37,576
that just include Apple

1063
00:44:38,076 --> 00:44:40,226
Thanks so much for coming

1064
00:44:40,226 --> 00:44:41,676
to see what you do

1065
00:44:42,196 --> 00:44:42,976
Enjoy the rest of the week.
