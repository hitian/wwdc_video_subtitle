[ Applause ]

3
00:00:27,486 --> 00:00:28,326
&gt;&gt; Good Morning.

4
00:00:28,506 --> 00:00:30,206
My name is David Duncan.

5
00:00:30,656 --> 00:00:33,446
And along with Kurt Revis

6
00:00:33,476 --> 00:00:35,596
about making your apps adaptive.

7
00:00:36,116 --> 00:00:41,296
So, in the first part,

8
00:00:41,366 --> 00:00:45,176
that Interface Builder has

9
00:00:45,286 --> 00:00:47,856
on how you can do adaptively.

10
00:00:48,876 --> 00:00:50,876
But in this part, we're

11
00:00:50,876 --> 00:00:55,156
about techniques that you can

12
00:00:56,236 --> 00:00:57,876
as well as code that

13
00:00:57,936 --> 00:01:01,136
to build your own experiences

14
00:00:57,936 --> 00:01:01,136
to build your own experiences

15
00:01:02,156 --> 00:01:04,006
So, let's look at

16
00:01:05,135 --> 00:01:06,416
The first thing we're

17
00:01:06,416 --> 00:01:10,356
about is just some basics on

18
00:01:10,356 --> 00:01:11,796
to refresh everyone's memory.

19
00:01:12,996 --> 00:01:16,806
In addition, we're going to talk

20
00:01:16,806 --> 00:01:19,986
in UIKit in the Tools

21
00:01:19,986 --> 00:01:24,106
with Interface Builder and so

22
00:01:25,106 --> 00:01:28,166
And finally, Kurt's going

23
00:01:28,166 --> 00:01:31,306
about how you can go

24
00:01:31,306 --> 00:01:32,766
to build your experiences.

25
00:01:33,356 --> 00:01:35,176
And so with that,

26
00:01:37,036 --> 00:01:39,086
So, sizes.

27
00:01:39,656 --> 00:01:41,956
If we go ahead and

28
00:01:41,956 --> 00:01:44,876
and their orientations and

29
00:01:44,876 --> 00:01:47,816
that's pretty

30
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:48,146
of things.

31
00:01:48,666 --> 00:01:51,606
I don't think anyone wants

32
00:01:51,606 --> 00:01:53,806
figure out what their layouts

33
00:01:53,936 --> 00:01:55,666
So let's see if we

34
00:01:55,806 --> 00:02:01,056
to simplify what all

35
00:01:55,806 --> 00:02:01,056
to simplify what all

36
00:02:01,056 --> 00:02:04,046
Well, that's still

37
00:02:04,136 --> 00:02:05,096
And I don't want you to read

38
00:02:05,096 --> 00:02:06,506
that because there's a

39
00:02:06,506 --> 00:02:07,506
And it's really hard to read.

40
00:02:07,566 --> 00:02:10,306
So let's see if we can

41
00:02:10,306 --> 00:02:11,656
and color and make it simpler.

42
00:02:11,656 --> 00:02:13,276
And it's not really helping.

43
00:02:13,446 --> 00:02:15,146
So, what else can we do?

44
00:02:16,036 --> 00:02:17,436
Well, when we thought about this

45
00:02:17,436 --> 00:02:21,946
in UIKit we thought what

46
00:02:22,136 --> 00:02:23,636
that we can divide this space

47
00:02:23,636 --> 00:02:26,846
up to create good

48
00:02:28,036 --> 00:02:30,696
And as you might have guessed

49
00:02:30,696 --> 00:02:32,236
about are size classes.

50
00:02:33,006 --> 00:02:36,386
We split the grid

51
00:02:36,386 --> 00:02:38,616
up into the compact

52
00:02:38,736 --> 00:02:40,046
compact height and

53
00:02:40,776 --> 00:02:42,816
And what we decided

54
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:46,346
in the compact space, you have

55
00:02:46,346 --> 00:02:48,056
where you try and make

56
00:02:48,806 --> 00:02:51,946
But in the regular

57
00:02:51,946 --> 00:02:54,576
to do more advanced things,

58
00:02:54,576 --> 00:02:57,086
with that space that really

59
00:02:58,076 --> 00:03:00,496
And so that take

60
00:02:58,076 --> 00:03:00,496
And so that take

61
00:03:00,496 --> 00:03:04,506
that when you see a regular size

62
00:03:04,506 --> 00:03:07,076
to make a really great

63
00:03:07,226 --> 00:03:09,976
with that space, going

64
00:03:10,176 --> 00:03:11,306
in a compact space.

65
00:03:12,366 --> 00:03:14,686
So, let's take a look at

66
00:03:14,686 --> 00:03:18,156
for you based on size class.

67
00:03:18,316 --> 00:03:20,986
Most views and controls

68
00:03:21,766 --> 00:03:23,376
So, you take a look

69
00:03:23,376 --> 00:03:25,546
It's the same whether you're

70
00:03:25,906 --> 00:03:27,486
That nav bar is also

71
00:03:27,486 --> 00:03:28,506
in compact or regular.

72
00:03:29,006 --> 00:03:30,486
But what things do change?

73
00:03:31,756 --> 00:03:33,426
Well, here's a presentation.

74
00:03:33,826 --> 00:03:35,486
It looks like it's a

75
00:03:35,486 --> 00:03:37,736
It's on a iPhone 6s Plus.

76
00:03:37,866 --> 00:03:40,076
But, if we rotate

77
00:03:40,076 --> 00:03:42,136
in compact, we see a form sheet.

78
00:03:42,796 --> 00:03:45,386
And so one thing you see

79
00:03:45,436 --> 00:03:47,496
if you do a form

80
00:03:47,496 --> 00:03:51,346
in regular size class, if you

81
00:03:51,596 --> 00:03:52,966
we don't have enough

82
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:55,406
And so we change that to a

83
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:58,896
Now, the thing in UIKit

84
00:03:58,896 --> 00:04:01,326
that does most complicated

85
00:03:58,896 --> 00:04:01,326
that does most complicated

86
00:04:01,326 --> 00:04:03,216
on size classes and

87
00:04:03,616 --> 00:04:05,166
is UISplitViewController.

88
00:04:05,776 --> 00:04:07,246
Again, we're looking

89
00:04:07,246 --> 00:04:10,926
at a compact width experience

90
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:14,186
And you see that, as you might

91
00:04:14,186 --> 00:04:15,806
you just got a navigation

92
00:04:15,846 --> 00:04:17,226
where we push and pop things.

93
00:04:17,755 --> 00:04:20,625
But again, if we rotate

94
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:22,256
we bring in the sidebar.

95
00:04:22,686 --> 00:04:26,796
And we think that on an iPhone

96
00:04:26,796 --> 00:04:28,596
in regular width that having

97
00:04:28,596 --> 00:04:32,546
that side bar is a better

98
00:04:33,056 --> 00:04:36,736
Even though we only have

99
00:04:37,266 --> 00:04:41,116
Similarly on iPad, the 9.7

100
00:04:41,586 --> 00:04:45,136
you can see that we keep that

101
00:04:45,136 --> 00:04:47,136
to easily switch

102
00:04:47,886 --> 00:04:49,836
But what do we do when

103
00:04:50,776 --> 00:04:53,396
Remember, on an iPad,

104
00:04:53,556 --> 00:04:57,606
But we've decided that on iPad

105
00:04:57,826 --> 00:05:01,386
that is much larger, much more

106
00:04:57,826 --> 00:05:01,386
that is much larger, much more

107
00:05:01,386 --> 00:05:04,096
and so forth, and you

108
00:05:04,196 --> 00:05:07,306
so that you can still

109
00:05:08,126 --> 00:05:11,556
However, we allow you

110
00:05:11,556 --> 00:05:14,696
so you can still easily

111
00:05:15,476 --> 00:05:20,386
And so those are some things

112
00:05:20,536 --> 00:05:24,556
to give you the best experience

113
00:05:24,686 --> 00:05:26,546
and the actual amount

114
00:05:27,626 --> 00:05:29,696
And in order to take

115
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:31,846
let's look at some

116
00:05:31,846 --> 00:05:35,926
to make the most out

117
00:05:36,636 --> 00:05:40,586
So, we're going to speak to some

118
00:05:41,066 --> 00:05:44,986
And in the first part, you saw

119
00:05:45,036 --> 00:05:46,716
to building adaptive

120
00:05:47,286 --> 00:05:50,216
Being able to easily make

121
00:05:50,296 --> 00:05:51,666
in gamut and other traits.

122
00:05:52,626 --> 00:05:55,836
But, Xcode also provides

123
00:05:55,836 --> 00:05:57,216
And Asset Catalogs are great,

124
00:05:57,336 --> 00:06:01,366
not just for organizing your

125
00:05:57,336 --> 00:06:01,366
not just for organizing your

126
00:06:01,366 --> 00:06:02,666
and how they should be used.

127
00:06:03,966 --> 00:06:06,466
And of course, UIKit

128
00:06:06,686 --> 00:06:08,726
that make building

129
00:06:09,616 --> 00:06:11,766
We've been talking about

130
00:06:11,766 --> 00:06:14,146
There are many sessions

131
00:06:14,146 --> 00:06:15,176
you should go review those.

132
00:06:15,546 --> 00:06:17,206
And of course, there's

133
00:06:17,306 --> 00:06:18,486
on New Things in Auto Layout.

134
00:06:19,776 --> 00:06:21,606
And trait collections

135
00:06:21,606 --> 00:06:22,696
in the first half as well.

136
00:06:23,776 --> 00:06:26,166
But other things

137
00:06:26,576 --> 00:06:29,766
which allows your application

138
00:06:29,946 --> 00:06:31,166
that users want to use.

139
00:06:32,516 --> 00:06:34,766
Layout Guides are a great way

140
00:06:34,766 --> 00:06:37,316
to pass Auto Layout

141
00:06:37,506 --> 00:06:39,046
And we're going to discuss

142
00:06:39,046 --> 00:06:40,556
that UIKit provides by default.

143
00:06:41,886 --> 00:06:44,606
And finally, UIAppearance

144
00:06:44,606 --> 00:06:48,466
to declaratively specify how

145
00:06:48,466 --> 00:06:49,856
controls and views to look.

146
00:06:50,876 --> 00:06:53,246
So let's go ahead and

147
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:59,546
Asset catalogs allow you to

148
00:06:59,546 --> 00:07:02,016
on the trait environment

149
00:06:59,546 --> 00:07:02,016
on the trait environment

150
00:07:02,956 --> 00:07:04,386
And here's a small

151
00:07:05,026 --> 00:07:07,426
So we've got our picture

152
00:07:07,616 --> 00:07:11,226
And we have 1, 2 and 3x

153
00:07:11,226 --> 00:07:16,546
So that whether you're on an

154
00:07:16,816 --> 00:07:18,936
you can get the best

155
00:07:18,936 --> 00:07:20,726
for the resolution

156
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:23,716
But another advantage of it is

157
00:07:23,716 --> 00:07:27,166
that Asset Catalogs lets you

158
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:31,126
And what that means is is that

159
00:07:31,406 --> 00:07:35,036
to an iPhone 6s, which is

160
00:07:35,036 --> 00:07:37,506
to pay the space penalty

161
00:07:37,506 --> 00:07:38,846
and 3x images as well.

162
00:07:39,716 --> 00:07:43,316
Similarly, we'll also trim

163
00:07:43,316 --> 00:07:44,286
and a few other things.

164
00:07:44,486 --> 00:07:46,466
So, use the Asset Catalogs

165
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:49,036
and you can make the best

166
00:07:49,296 --> 00:07:50,776
and carry the least

167
00:07:50,776 --> 00:07:52,486
when you actually

168
00:07:52,966 --> 00:07:57,896
Other things that Asset Catalogs

169
00:07:57,896 --> 00:08:00,636
that you can attach to your

170
00:07:57,896 --> 00:08:00,636
that you can attach to your

171
00:08:00,966 --> 00:08:03,436
And the first one we're going

172
00:08:03,926 --> 00:08:05,426
So let's bring baby

173
00:08:06,266 --> 00:08:08,116
And let's say that we

174
00:08:08,176 --> 00:08:10,196
where sometimes we actually want

175
00:08:10,196 --> 00:08:12,016
to crop this image

176
00:08:12,796 --> 00:08:15,416
And if we just naively pick

177
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:16,816
we'd miss most of her face.

178
00:08:17,086 --> 00:08:20,646
We really do want that square

179
00:08:21,796 --> 00:08:23,446
Now, what are you going to do?

180
00:08:23,496 --> 00:08:25,926
Well, you're going to bring in

181
00:08:25,926 --> 00:08:28,056
out how far are you away

182
00:08:28,976 --> 00:08:32,006
But, instead of having to put

183
00:08:32,006 --> 00:08:36,035
with assets, you can do that

184
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:38,775
And UIImage will vend

185
00:08:38,895 --> 00:08:40,265
to you whenever you need them.

186
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:42,866
And similarly, of course, you

187
00:08:43,275 --> 00:08:44,196
But being able to put them

188
00:08:44,196 --> 00:08:45,656
in the Asset Catalog

189
00:08:45,656 --> 00:08:48,496
to have a giant table

190
00:08:48,836 --> 00:08:49,496
with metadata.

191
00:08:50,856 --> 00:08:54,366
Similarly, let's say that you

192
00:08:54,366 --> 00:08:57,826
for a table view or what have

193
00:08:57,826 --> 00:09:01,206
to resize to adapt to whatever

194
00:08:57,826 --> 00:09:01,206
to resize to adapt to whatever

195
00:09:01,816 --> 00:09:06,036
Well, you can create a nine-part

196
00:09:06,516 --> 00:09:08,866
and store those in your

197
00:09:09,506 --> 00:09:12,136
And then, when that image

198
00:09:13,206 --> 00:09:15,236
it resizes nicely

199
00:09:15,236 --> 00:09:18,056
around large images

200
00:09:18,056 --> 00:09:18,906
that you're working with.

201
00:09:20,316 --> 00:09:22,536
And so, that's for

202
00:09:22,576 --> 00:09:24,776
Let's talk about other

203
00:09:24,776 --> 00:09:27,306
to make for your

204
00:09:28,706 --> 00:09:29,796
We love Dynamic Type.

205
00:09:30,506 --> 00:09:33,216
It gives our users the

206
00:09:33,386 --> 00:09:36,456
and especially for our users

207
00:09:36,456 --> 00:09:39,026
with vision, they can

208
00:09:39,026 --> 00:09:41,066
that allow them to

209
00:09:41,856 --> 00:09:45,006
And so this year, we've

210
00:09:45,006 --> 00:09:47,296
to adopt Dynamic Type

211
00:09:47,846 --> 00:09:49,246
And we've done this in two ways.

212
00:09:49,886 --> 00:09:52,516
The first, we made it part

213
00:09:52,726 --> 00:09:55,976
So you don't have to listen

214
00:09:56,256 --> 00:09:58,566
It's just right there for

215
00:09:58,566 --> 00:10:00,246
to take advantage

216
00:09:58,566 --> 00:10:00,246
to take advantage

217
00:10:00,426 --> 00:10:03,246
But we figured you

218
00:10:03,246 --> 00:10:05,446
that for regular text

219
00:10:05,486 --> 00:10:07,046
text fields and text views.

220
00:10:08,026 --> 00:10:10,216
So we've made those

221
00:10:10,616 --> 00:10:13,786
All you have to do is assign

222
00:10:13,786 --> 00:10:17,086
that you want and set the

223
00:10:17,086 --> 00:10:18,486
for the content size category.

224
00:10:18,936 --> 00:10:21,236
All your labels, your text

225
00:10:21,436 --> 00:10:24,116
they'll automatically adapt to

226
00:10:24,116 --> 00:10:25,546
and you don't have

227
00:10:27,516 --> 00:10:31,506
[ Applause ]

228
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:33,726
So of course, if

229
00:10:33,726 --> 00:10:36,226
be certain to test

230
00:10:36,226 --> 00:10:37,636
in all the Dynamic Type sizes.

231
00:10:37,636 --> 00:10:39,716
As I mentioned, there's

232
00:10:40,196 --> 00:10:42,686
The Accessibility Inspector

233
00:10:42,686 --> 00:10:45,516
to your application and allow

234
00:10:45,516 --> 00:10:47,246
without having to go back

235
00:10:48,096 --> 00:10:50,916
And if you're displaying these

236
00:10:51,066 --> 00:10:52,766
you'll want to review

237
00:10:52,766 --> 00:10:54,596
in Collection View" session,

238
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:57,336
because there's some really

239
00:10:57,336 --> 00:10:59,656
and behavior enhancements

240
00:10:59,866 --> 00:11:01,956
that you can take advantage

241
00:10:59,866 --> 00:11:01,956
that you can take advantage

242
00:11:03,476 --> 00:11:05,936
And so, let's talk

243
00:11:07,056 --> 00:11:10,076
And UIView provides

244
00:11:10,646 --> 00:11:13,066
a Margin Guide the

245
00:11:13,066 --> 00:11:14,326
And we'll go through

246
00:11:15,156 --> 00:11:17,256
Both of these start

247
00:11:18,126 --> 00:11:19,576
Whatever content you

248
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:24,136
The Layout Margins

249
00:11:24,376 --> 00:11:27,556
by a property UIView that

250
00:11:28,026 --> 00:11:29,986
which defines insets

251
00:11:31,156 --> 00:11:33,606
And so, how do we then

252
00:11:33,956 --> 00:11:37,686
Well, that's just a rec

253
00:11:38,436 --> 00:11:40,666
And that Layout Margin

254
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:42,966
provides auto layout

255
00:11:42,966 --> 00:11:44,646
to generate your

256
00:11:45,256 --> 00:11:49,226
Simple. So, what's the

257
00:11:49,226 --> 00:11:50,206
in relation to this?

258
00:11:51,436 --> 00:11:55,696
The Readable Content Guide

259
00:11:55,696 --> 00:11:57,706
with information on

260
00:11:57,706 --> 00:12:00,336
so that it has a nice,

261
00:11:57,706 --> 00:12:00,336
so that it has a nice,

262
00:12:00,456 --> 00:12:04,776
If you're on one of the

263
00:12:05,086 --> 00:12:08,186
you can layout text from side

264
00:12:08,186 --> 00:12:09,766
of being turning their

265
00:12:10,556 --> 00:12:11,666
So, the first thing we want

266
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:15,466
to calculate is what is the

267
00:12:16,526 --> 00:12:18,116
And then, of course,

268
00:12:18,116 --> 00:12:19,246
to flow outside of the margins.

269
00:12:19,306 --> 00:12:21,476
So we bring in that

270
00:12:21,476 --> 00:12:22,966
as part of our calculation.

271
00:12:23,516 --> 00:12:24,846
And we combine these two

272
00:12:24,846 --> 00:12:27,786
to finally form the

273
00:12:28,186 --> 00:12:30,496
another layout guide

274
00:12:30,886 --> 00:12:32,266
that you can lay

275
00:12:32,736 --> 00:12:35,966
Now, the Readable

276
00:12:35,966 --> 00:12:37,166
on the dynamic text size.

277
00:12:37,736 --> 00:12:39,636
So, what happens

278
00:12:40,136 --> 00:12:42,426
Well, we increase

279
00:12:42,426 --> 00:12:43,996
and the ideal width increases.

280
00:12:44,546 --> 00:12:47,446
And as you can see, because the

281
00:12:47,536 --> 00:12:48,996
inside of the layout margins,

282
00:12:49,466 --> 00:12:52,316
the guide doesn't necessarily

283
00:12:52,316 --> 00:12:54,146
And then you can

284
00:12:54,476 --> 00:12:56,016
and get a nice readable length

285
00:12:56,016 --> 00:12:58,666
of text that's inside

286
00:12:59,996 --> 00:13:02,586
And so with that, let's

287
00:12:59,996 --> 00:13:02,586
And so with that, let's

288
00:13:04,126 --> 00:13:06,966
UIAppearance, if you haven't

289
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:10,436
for you to specify what your

290
00:13:11,046 --> 00:13:11,846
And what does that mean?

291
00:13:12,736 --> 00:13:15,376
Well, that means that

292
00:13:15,436 --> 00:13:18,396
when you see a new tab bar,

293
00:13:19,156 --> 00:13:21,286
You say, for all of my tab bars,

294
00:13:21,726 --> 00:13:25,196
the appearance should have the

295
00:13:25,816 --> 00:13:26,476
Really simple.

296
00:13:26,716 --> 00:13:28,456
And that any time

297
00:13:28,896 --> 00:13:30,106
unselected items

298
00:13:31,206 --> 00:13:32,506
But it's also contextual.

299
00:13:33,006 --> 00:13:35,596
And that means that

300
00:13:35,596 --> 00:13:40,496
on trait collections or based on

301
00:13:40,646 --> 00:13:43,896
And what does that look like?

302
00:13:43,896 --> 00:13:44,836
Let's take a look.

303
00:13:45,506 --> 00:13:48,766
So, here we have our

304
00:13:49,306 --> 00:13:53,286
And as is the style, we want

305
00:13:53,286 --> 00:13:56,016
at the top when we're in

306
00:13:56,016 --> 00:13:56,986
And we're going to have

307
00:13:56,986 --> 00:13:59,486
that image just replace

308
00:14:00,226 --> 00:14:02,476
However, when we're in

309
00:14:02,476 --> 00:14:04,866
we're going to have a

310
00:14:04,866 --> 00:14:06,656
And the image is not going

311
00:14:06,656 --> 00:14:07,656
to the navigation bar.

312
00:14:07,656 --> 00:14:10,546
So we want it to use

313
00:14:11,046 --> 00:14:12,786
So let's do the default

314
00:14:13,836 --> 00:14:17,526
We create a TraitCollection

315
00:14:18,836 --> 00:14:21,096
We grab the navigation

316
00:14:21,096 --> 00:14:22,236
for that TraitCollection.

317
00:14:23,476 --> 00:14:25,266
And we say we don't want

318
00:14:25,266 --> 00:14:27,676
to use any background

319
00:14:27,966 --> 00:14:29,986
And that will cause the

320
00:14:29,986 --> 00:14:31,446
to using its default appearance.

321
00:14:32,656 --> 00:14:36,476
Similarly, when we do

322
00:14:37,246 --> 00:14:41,616
we create a trait collection

323
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:45,656
and assign an empty image, which

324
00:14:45,876 --> 00:14:48,196
to construct no background

325
00:14:49,186 --> 00:14:51,696
Now, you might note

326
00:14:52,046 --> 00:14:54,736
for trait collection, that

327
00:14:54,786 --> 00:14:57,436
We're actually going to be

328
00:14:57,436 --> 00:14:58,576
so be on the lookout for that.

329
00:14:59,786 --> 00:15:02,196
And so with that,

330
00:14:59,786 --> 00:15:02,196
And so with that,

331
00:15:02,196 --> 00:15:03,616
up the best practices section

332
00:15:04,296 --> 00:15:06,536
where we reviewed

333
00:15:06,536 --> 00:15:07,756
to organize your images.

334
00:15:08,836 --> 00:15:12,306
Dynamic Type to adapt to the

335
00:15:13,376 --> 00:15:16,456
Layout Guides to help you

336
00:15:16,456 --> 00:15:20,116
that are easily adaptable to

337
00:15:20,706 --> 00:15:22,706
And finally, Appearance

338
00:15:22,776 --> 00:15:25,466
to get your application looking

339
00:15:25,826 --> 00:15:27,696
And so with that, I'll

340
00:15:29,516 --> 00:15:34,816
[ Applause ]

341
00:15:35,316 --> 00:15:35,976
&gt;&gt; Thank you, David.

342
00:15:37,116 --> 00:15:40,446
So, if you remember from

343
00:15:40,616 --> 00:15:43,946
Part 1" you'll remember the

344
00:15:44,346 --> 00:15:45,666
The system is going to do most

345
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:47,246
of the work, so you

346
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:50,206
Now, I'm going to talk today

347
00:15:51,006 --> 00:15:54,236
So, if you want to go beyond

348
00:15:54,836 --> 00:15:55,806
here's how to do it.

349
00:15:56,436 --> 00:15:58,476
And the operative word

350
00:15:58,636 --> 00:15:59,706
This isn't required.

351
00:16:00,466 --> 00:16:03,216
However, if you don't -- even

352
00:16:03,216 --> 00:16:05,236
of this, you might learn

353
00:16:05,236 --> 00:16:07,186
to work more effectively

354
00:16:08,556 --> 00:16:10,926
So I'll talk about how

355
00:16:11,996 --> 00:16:15,626
I'll tell you how to design your

356
00:16:15,626 --> 00:16:17,526
of device orientation and size.

357
00:16:17,636 --> 00:16:20,426
I'll talk about how you

358
00:16:20,426 --> 00:16:21,996
and change between

359
00:16:22,076 --> 00:16:23,316
as your app changes size.

360
00:16:23,616 --> 00:16:26,306
And then I'll talk about

361
00:16:26,306 --> 00:16:29,156
to make it quicker and

362
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:30,746
And I'll do this in

363
00:16:30,936 --> 00:16:32,046
We'll build a real app here.

364
00:16:32,756 --> 00:16:35,456
So, I'll call my app My

365
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:38,176
And fortunately, it's

366
00:16:38,806 --> 00:16:41,486
We've only got three things that

367
00:16:42,426 --> 00:16:43,216
Three items.

368
00:16:43,346 --> 00:16:44,216
Each one has a title.

369
00:16:44,456 --> 00:16:45,966
Here they're just A, B and C.

370
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:48,846
And then there's a longer

371
00:16:48,846 --> 00:16:49,796
that goes with each one.

372
00:16:50,626 --> 00:16:52,166
So even though this

373
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:53,976
I'm going to use

374
00:16:53,976 --> 00:16:57,666
in your much more

375
00:16:58,216 --> 00:17:00,146
So this is the model of my app.

376
00:16:58,216 --> 00:17:00,146
So this is the model of my app.

377
00:17:00,396 --> 00:17:01,616
This is the data inside of it.

378
00:17:01,906 --> 00:17:04,195
But how should my app look

379
00:17:04,646 --> 00:17:05,386
What's the design?

380
00:17:06,726 --> 00:17:08,566
Well, when I'm thinking

381
00:17:08,955 --> 00:17:10,796
I need to consider all

382
00:17:11,425 --> 00:17:14,445
But that's far too much to do

383
00:17:14,526 --> 00:17:15,915
That would be far too much work.

384
00:17:16,486 --> 00:17:17,746
So let's try to simplify this.

385
00:17:18,546 --> 00:17:21,016
I think in my app I can do

386
00:17:21,675 --> 00:17:23,086
I'll call the first

387
00:17:23,215 --> 00:17:25,776
And I'll arrange these

388
00:17:25,776 --> 00:17:26,976
and C vertically in the stack.

389
00:17:28,036 --> 00:17:29,526
My other design will be "Wide."

390
00:17:29,996 --> 00:17:31,706
So I'll arrange these

391
00:17:32,886 --> 00:17:35,676
Now, I think no matter what

392
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:37,646
for my app I can use one

393
00:17:37,646 --> 00:17:40,776
of these two designs

394
00:17:40,776 --> 00:17:42,846
So now the question

395
00:17:42,846 --> 00:17:44,456
of device orientation and size,

396
00:17:44,456 --> 00:17:46,376
how do I choose what

397
00:17:46,906 --> 00:17:48,326
I need to define

398
00:17:48,516 --> 00:17:49,916
And again, this is

399
00:17:51,086 --> 00:17:53,766
I think I'm going to

400
00:17:53,766 --> 00:17:56,756
than the height, I'll

401
00:17:56,806 --> 00:17:58,656
Otherwise, I'll use

402
00:17:59,936 --> 00:18:01,756
Now, I can run through

403
00:17:59,936 --> 00:18:01,756
Now, I can run through

404
00:18:01,756 --> 00:18:02,816
and see how it works.

405
00:18:02,816 --> 00:18:05,306
I can do this on paper before

406
00:18:05,306 --> 00:18:05,586
at all.

407
00:18:06,406 --> 00:18:09,636
So for instance, this iPhone

408
00:18:09,636 --> 00:18:11,826
than the height, we'll

409
00:18:11,826 --> 00:18:15,146
Now, I can continue that

410
00:18:15,436 --> 00:18:19,016
and with an iPad, full screen,

411
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:21,136
and go through all the

412
00:18:21,136 --> 00:18:23,726
and make sure they make sense.

413
00:18:23,906 --> 00:18:25,286
So I'll reiterate

414
00:18:25,386 --> 00:18:27,266
When I'm designing my

415
00:18:27,886 --> 00:18:29,596
I thought through

416
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:33,626
I came up with designs to

417
00:18:33,626 --> 00:18:34,276
the whole range.

418
00:18:34,516 --> 00:18:38,806
And then I defined rules

419
00:18:40,376 --> 00:18:42,186
So when I'm defining

420
00:18:42,556 --> 00:18:43,606
there's many ways I can do it.

421
00:18:43,606 --> 00:18:44,826
This is what makes

422
00:18:45,566 --> 00:18:48,236
But you'll note that I

423
00:18:48,236 --> 00:18:50,646
if the size exactly

424
00:18:50,646 --> 00:18:54,146
I could have seen is

425
00:18:54,146 --> 00:18:57,256
therefore it's an iPad and

426
00:18:57,256 --> 00:18:59,506
I don't want to do that because

427
00:18:59,506 --> 00:18:59,956
to handle.

428
00:19:00,086 --> 00:19:02,166
And those sizes will

429
00:19:03,496 --> 00:19:06,136
So instead, I defined a

430
00:19:06,136 --> 00:19:08,076
that would tell me

431
00:19:08,556 --> 00:19:09,936
And there's many

432
00:19:10,636 --> 00:19:13,206
The first one, and most obvious,

433
00:19:13,236 --> 00:19:14,816
Then we've done most

434
00:19:15,036 --> 00:19:17,906
All you have to do is check

435
00:19:19,086 --> 00:19:21,386
Also, your app will act like

436
00:19:21,386 --> 00:19:23,216
because you're using

437
00:19:23,856 --> 00:19:25,566
All the Xcode tooling

438
00:19:25,736 --> 00:19:27,456
You'll get a lot of

439
00:19:28,116 --> 00:19:29,906
But, you can also

440
00:19:30,546 --> 00:19:32,866
For instance, I could

441
00:19:32,866 --> 00:19:34,446
or height to a threshold value.

442
00:19:35,506 --> 00:19:38,296
Or I could compare two values

443
00:19:38,956 --> 00:19:39,906
Or I could combine these.

444
00:19:40,216 --> 00:19:43,616
The point is that I came up with

445
00:19:43,616 --> 00:19:45,306
to figure out what

446
00:19:46,806 --> 00:19:48,566
So another thing

447
00:19:48,566 --> 00:19:50,996
about your designs is even

448
00:19:51,316 --> 00:19:53,966
you might be, say, on one side

449
00:19:54,646 --> 00:19:58,406
So don't make your designs

450
00:19:58,406 --> 00:20:00,756
on the device are, or

451
00:19:58,406 --> 00:20:00,756
on the device are, or

452
00:20:00,756 --> 00:20:04,816
if you're multitasking,

453
00:20:05,046 --> 00:20:06,676
I'll need to find

454
00:20:07,696 --> 00:20:10,666
I'll need to use those rules

455
00:20:11,346 --> 00:20:13,516
And then last, I'll apply

456
00:20:13,856 --> 00:20:16,326
So change the views of

457
00:20:17,616 --> 00:20:19,066
Now, where should

458
00:20:19,886 --> 00:20:22,846
If I make a new template in

459
00:20:23,196 --> 00:20:25,126
it gives me this template

460
00:20:25,126 --> 00:20:27,136
And it says do any

461
00:20:27,316 --> 00:20:28,566
So that's where I

462
00:20:29,526 --> 00:20:30,906
Unfortunately, it's

463
00:20:31,486 --> 00:20:33,226
The reason you don't

464
00:20:33,226 --> 00:20:35,086
because views get

465
00:20:35,636 --> 00:20:37,596
The first time something

466
00:20:37,596 --> 00:20:39,116
in your view controller,

467
00:20:39,676 --> 00:20:40,706
And that's very early.

468
00:20:41,576 --> 00:20:43,836
So we know at that

469
00:20:43,836 --> 00:20:44,756
in a superview yet.

470
00:20:45,486 --> 00:20:46,906
Layout wont' be valid yet.

471
00:20:46,906 --> 00:20:49,486
So you really can't

472
00:20:49,486 --> 00:20:52,076
or any parent size

473
00:20:52,156 --> 00:20:52,876
It's just too early.

474
00:20:54,016 --> 00:20:57,716
So for one-time only things

475
00:20:57,716 --> 00:21:00,116
viewDidLoad, you only want

476
00:20:57,716 --> 00:21:00,116
viewDidLoad, you only want

477
00:21:00,116 --> 00:21:03,106
to be the same across

478
00:21:03,226 --> 00:21:05,606
A better place for

479
00:21:05,606 --> 00:21:07,776
in a view controller's

480
00:21:09,596 --> 00:21:10,916
And we'll view that because

481
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:13,486
at that time the view

482
00:21:14,076 --> 00:21:15,916
Layout of all those

483
00:21:16,236 --> 00:21:17,166
Sizes are valid.

484
00:21:17,306 --> 00:21:18,446
My view size is valid.

485
00:21:18,446 --> 00:21:19,236
Traits are valid.

486
00:21:19,606 --> 00:21:21,526
Everything's good.

487
00:21:21,676 --> 00:21:24,736
And also, this is a good time

488
00:21:24,736 --> 00:21:25,606
of my view controller.

489
00:21:25,796 --> 00:21:28,026
So this is where I should

490
00:21:28,026 --> 00:21:31,746
controller views and

491
00:21:31,746 --> 00:21:33,726
Now, it's important

492
00:21:34,176 --> 00:21:36,466
Because this is a very hot path.

493
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:37,776
This is called very often.

494
00:21:37,776 --> 00:21:39,666
Often, for reasons

495
00:21:40,656 --> 00:21:44,306
So, do as little work as you

496
00:21:45,176 --> 00:21:47,326
Ideally you would find

497
00:21:47,526 --> 00:21:50,106
since the last time it was

498
00:21:50,106 --> 00:21:51,836
as you can to update

499
00:21:52,216 --> 00:21:54,336
So change only the

500
00:21:54,336 --> 00:21:56,186
that you absolutely

501
00:21:56,396 --> 00:22:00,756
And then finally, be careful

502
00:21:56,396 --> 00:22:00,756
And then finally, be careful

503
00:22:01,296 --> 00:22:03,336
If you invalidate layout

504
00:22:03,826 --> 00:22:05,686
they might in turn

505
00:22:05,746 --> 00:22:08,426
And soon you're finding that

506
00:22:08,426 --> 00:22:10,786
and invalidating layout and

507
00:22:11,486 --> 00:22:13,606
So to find out more about

508
00:22:13,606 --> 00:22:15,426
out about layout loops,

509
00:22:15,426 --> 00:22:16,946
in Auto Layout" session

510
00:22:19,406 --> 00:22:20,916
So, here's my two designs.

511
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:22,466
We'll go back to this.

512
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:24,596
How am I actually going

513
00:22:25,656 --> 00:22:27,596
Well, I think I can

514
00:22:27,866 --> 00:22:29,446
for each item, A, B, and C.

515
00:22:29,736 --> 00:22:32,156
And then I'll us a UIStackView

516
00:22:32,156 --> 00:22:34,376
to arrange these things

517
00:22:34,886 --> 00:22:36,576
UIStackView will do

518
00:22:36,576 --> 00:22:38,986
I don't have to think too hard.

519
00:22:39,076 --> 00:22:39,716
So here's some code.

520
00:22:40,506 --> 00:22:42,936
My simple example view

521
00:22:42,936 --> 00:22:43,906
of UIVIewController.

522
00:22:44,646 --> 00:22:45,966
And I made a storyboard

523
00:22:45,966 --> 00:22:46,996
It's got a stack view in it

524
00:22:46,996 --> 00:22:48,746
and it's already got

525
00:22:50,056 --> 00:22:52,636
Now, I am going to,

526
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:55,366
in my viewWillLayoutSubviews

527
00:22:56,266 --> 00:22:59,106
First step, get the size,

528
00:23:00,216 --> 00:23:01,566
Second, apply my rules.

529
00:23:01,976 --> 00:23:04,796
So if the width is

530
00:23:04,796 --> 00:23:08,246
or equal to the height, I will

531
00:23:08,246 --> 00:23:11,146
And then finally I'll

532
00:23:11,876 --> 00:23:14,096
So, if I'm using

533
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:16,686
my stack view's access

534
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:17,766
Otherwise it should be vertical.

535
00:23:18,296 --> 00:23:19,626
That's all I have to do.

536
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:22,246
So you'll note that here

537
00:23:23,076 --> 00:23:24,756
And I'm also taking

538
00:23:24,836 --> 00:23:25,826
that StackView is smart.

539
00:23:26,576 --> 00:23:29,706
If I'm setting the access to

540
00:23:29,826 --> 00:23:31,446
it's not going to do

541
00:23:33,176 --> 00:23:34,456
So let's see this in action.

542
00:23:34,866 --> 00:23:36,716
Here's my app on an

543
00:23:36,886 --> 00:23:37,986
We've got that vertical layout.

544
00:23:37,986 --> 00:23:40,576
And now if I rotate

545
00:23:41,246 --> 00:23:44,396
we'll see that the app

546
00:23:45,256 --> 00:23:47,096
And also I got this

547
00:23:47,666 --> 00:23:49,476
So I'll go back to portrait

548
00:23:53,136 --> 00:23:53,926
There we are.

549
00:23:54,136 --> 00:23:54,686
We rotated.

550
00:23:55,146 --> 00:23:56,466
So, I showed this to David,

551
00:23:56,466 --> 00:23:57,576
because I was especially

552
00:23:57,576 --> 00:23:59,386
that StackView gave me

553
00:23:59,386 --> 00:24:00,256
I didn't expect that.

554
00:23:59,386 --> 00:24:00,256
I didn't expect that.

555
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:01,816
And he said, "Well,

556
00:24:01,926 --> 00:24:02,586
That's pretty amazing.

557
00:24:02,586 --> 00:24:03,836
But can you make it better?

558
00:24:04,076 --> 00:24:04,906
Could you make it pop?"

559
00:24:05,706 --> 00:24:07,896
And if you're an app developer,

560
00:24:07,896 --> 00:24:08,876
from one of your clients.

561
00:24:09,436 --> 00:24:11,146
So I said, "Sure, I

562
00:24:11,306 --> 00:24:13,626
I can make my app a

563
00:24:13,626 --> 00:24:14,646
and I'll make it pop here.

564
00:24:15,136 --> 00:24:18,596
So I'll do this by,

565
00:24:18,596 --> 00:24:20,246
I'll make the items

566
00:24:21,266 --> 00:24:23,986
And then when I'm done, I'll

567
00:24:24,166 --> 00:24:25,036
shrink back to normal.

568
00:24:25,406 --> 00:24:30,216
Now, this isn't something

569
00:24:30,516 --> 00:24:31,776
that you do in your app.

570
00:24:32,786 --> 00:24:35,506
Not this particular

571
00:24:35,916 --> 00:24:37,926
But the point is where

572
00:24:37,926 --> 00:24:40,206
and where I'm exactly

573
00:24:41,116 --> 00:24:44,066
So, I'm doing this code

574
00:24:44,066 --> 00:24:45,556
to size with coordinator.

575
00:24:46,386 --> 00:24:49,256
And I'm doing this because it

576
00:24:49,346 --> 00:24:50,826
size change or a rotation.

577
00:24:51,416 --> 00:24:53,056
And I'm giving this

578
00:24:53,056 --> 00:24:55,166
up animations alongside

579
00:24:55,196 --> 00:24:56,296
and to happen afterwards.

580
00:24:57,206 --> 00:24:59,586
Now, why don't I put all

581
00:25:00,136 --> 00:25:01,856
That's because this isn't

582
00:25:01,856 --> 00:25:03,216
through when your app launches.

583
00:25:03,706 --> 00:25:05,276
There's other reasons, but

584
00:25:06,676 --> 00:25:09,246
So I'll use the coordinator

585
00:25:09,246 --> 00:25:11,046
to animate alongside

586
00:25:11,556 --> 00:25:13,676
And all I have to do in this

587
00:25:13,676 --> 00:25:14,816
that I want to be animated.

588
00:25:15,066 --> 00:25:16,796
It'll go alongside the rotation

589
00:25:16,796 --> 00:25:18,896
with the same curve

590
00:25:19,576 --> 00:25:22,476
And I'm going to set that stack

591
00:25:22,476 --> 00:25:24,306
up of a factor of 1.4.

592
00:25:24,306 --> 00:25:26,556
So a little bit bigger.

593
00:25:26,716 --> 00:25:28,216
Then when I'm done, I get to set

594
00:25:28,216 --> 00:25:30,096
up my own animation

595
00:25:30,226 --> 00:25:31,296
Here I'm picking .5.

596
00:25:31,296 --> 00:25:32,346
And we'll go back to normal.

597
00:25:32,346 --> 00:25:34,606
We'll set the affine

598
00:25:35,026 --> 00:25:35,666
So back to normal.

599
00:25:36,616 --> 00:25:37,406
So here we go.

600
00:25:38,096 --> 00:25:40,046
Here's the same app just with

601
00:25:41,016 --> 00:25:41,626
It'll rotate.

602
00:25:41,856 --> 00:25:46,196
And it popped towards

603
00:25:46,816 --> 00:25:49,706
If we rotate again, it

604
00:25:50,896 --> 00:25:51,496
So there we go.

605
00:25:51,826 --> 00:25:53,266
I got to add that pop effect.

606
00:25:53,266 --> 00:25:54,836
I got to make it a

607
00:25:54,936 --> 00:25:57,176
But I didn't have to

608
00:25:57,306 --> 00:25:58,156
It remained the same.

609
00:25:58,156 --> 00:25:59,436
So I just added it on top.

610
00:25:59,916 --> 00:26:04,756
So the last thing I'd like to

611
00:25:59,916 --> 00:26:04,756
So the last thing I'd like to

612
00:26:05,686 --> 00:26:08,876
And this is a way that you can

613
00:26:08,876 --> 00:26:11,626
that can be reused

614
00:26:12,506 --> 00:26:15,606
This way you can build you app

615
00:26:15,606 --> 00:26:17,366
of these different

616
00:26:17,366 --> 00:26:18,106
to rewrite everything.

617
00:26:19,396 --> 00:26:21,136
We'll do this by using

618
00:26:21,296 --> 00:26:23,196
Each piece will typically

619
00:26:23,506 --> 00:26:25,336
And that's because

620
00:26:25,336 --> 00:26:26,576
of useful stuff all together.

621
00:26:27,066 --> 00:26:29,316
For instance, you get

622
00:26:29,316 --> 00:26:31,626
not just a single view,

623
00:26:32,206 --> 00:26:33,726
and all their constraints

624
00:26:34,976 --> 00:26:36,986
You get to make connections

625
00:26:36,986 --> 00:26:40,056
So you might perform a segue

626
00:26:40,096 --> 00:26:43,906
or present something, find

627
00:26:43,906 --> 00:26:44,396
and so on.

628
00:26:45,316 --> 00:26:47,136
And also, it's a place

629
00:26:47,136 --> 00:26:48,576
to the rest of your app.

630
00:26:48,576 --> 00:26:51,966
So you might have a connection

631
00:26:51,966 --> 00:26:54,076
that represents network

632
00:26:54,136 --> 00:26:57,446
Now, the view controllers

633
00:26:57,446 --> 00:26:59,116
to perform different roles.

634
00:26:59,886 --> 00:27:01,566
You might have a

635
00:26:59,886 --> 00:27:01,566
You might have a

636
00:27:02,196 --> 00:27:06,476
And it might contain multiple

637
00:27:06,596 --> 00:27:08,446
Now, you're probably used

638
00:27:08,446 --> 00:27:10,576
to writing contained

639
00:27:10,576 --> 00:27:13,136
and then putting them in

640
00:27:13,786 --> 00:27:15,716
For example a navigation

641
00:27:15,716 --> 00:27:18,326
or split view controller or a

642
00:27:18,326 --> 00:27:21,106
But you can write your own

643
00:27:21,436 --> 00:27:23,756
And this lets you really

644
00:27:23,756 --> 00:27:25,856
You can do a lot of

645
00:27:26,546 --> 00:27:27,876
So I'll show how to do this.

646
00:27:28,116 --> 00:27:29,016
Here's my designs again.

647
00:27:29,016 --> 00:27:33,116
And in my case, I think I can

648
00:27:33,116 --> 00:27:37,846
controller that I'll call

649
00:27:38,386 --> 00:27:41,226
And inside of that I'll have

650
00:27:41,356 --> 00:27:44,166
one for each one

651
00:27:44,346 --> 00:27:47,426
Now, thinking about it, I think

652
00:27:47,426 --> 00:27:48,206
to my design.

653
00:27:48,606 --> 00:27:51,116
So if I don't have much

654
00:27:51,116 --> 00:27:52,966
to show just a preview

655
00:27:52,966 --> 00:27:55,006
I don't have room for the

656
00:27:56,076 --> 00:27:59,086
So, when I click on one of

657
00:27:59,086 --> 00:28:01,436
tap on one of these items,

658
00:27:59,086 --> 00:28:01,436
tap on one of these items,

659
00:28:01,946 --> 00:28:04,146
I will present another

660
00:28:04,146 --> 00:28:05,326
that shows the full text.

661
00:28:06,216 --> 00:28:07,686
Then when I tap on

662
00:28:08,046 --> 00:28:09,426
we'll dismiss it, it'll go away.

663
00:28:10,676 --> 00:28:14,446
So I'll do this by having my

664
00:28:14,446 --> 00:28:17,426
will have three small

665
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:18,426
I'll define this later.

666
00:28:19,296 --> 00:28:22,416
When we present one, when we

667
00:28:22,416 --> 00:28:24,906
and present a new large

668
00:28:26,306 --> 00:28:29,256
Now, if my app is big enough,

669
00:28:29,256 --> 00:28:32,756
I'd like to just show the large

670
00:28:32,796 --> 00:28:35,836
here directly in that container.

671
00:28:36,246 --> 00:28:38,386
So my container will

672
00:28:38,386 --> 00:28:40,586
of another class

673
00:28:41,266 --> 00:28:44,876
And when the app size

674
00:28:45,126 --> 00:28:47,856
we'll change the view

675
00:28:47,856 --> 00:28:49,106
between one of these two states.

676
00:28:50,226 --> 00:28:51,266
So I'll show the code here.

677
00:28:51,526 --> 00:28:52,406
We're going to work our way

678
00:28:52,406 --> 00:28:55,376
up from the contained view

679
00:28:55,556 --> 00:28:56,906
So we'll start with

680
00:28:56,956 --> 00:28:58,246
for these contained

681
00:28:58,876 --> 00:28:59,636
And it's pretty simple.

682
00:28:59,636 --> 00:29:01,966
We've just got a simple

683
00:28:59,636 --> 00:29:01,966
We've just got a simple

684
00:29:02,566 --> 00:29:04,206
You'll note that I

685
00:29:04,206 --> 00:29:05,926
to be

686
00:29:06,576 --> 00:29:09,816
And I also set the storyboard

687
00:29:09,976 --> 00:29:11,916
This way I can find these

688
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:13,076
and instantiate them later.

689
00:29:13,476 --> 00:29:15,996
For the

690
00:29:15,996 --> 00:29:16,436
it's bigger.

691
00:29:16,436 --> 00:29:17,636
It's got that extra text in it.

692
00:29:17,986 --> 00:29:18,656
The same idea.

693
00:29:18,846 --> 00:29:21,416
I set my custom class to

694
00:29:21,486 --> 00:29:22,956
And I set the identifier.

695
00:29:24,256 --> 00:29:26,606
So here's the code for the

696
00:29:27,196 --> 00:29:28,006
We'll start with this.

697
00:29:28,066 --> 00:29:30,486
And I know that every time I

698
00:29:30,526 --> 00:29:32,406
to tap it to show the large one.

699
00:29:32,846 --> 00:29:36,256
So in my viewDidLoad, this is

700
00:29:36,396 --> 00:29:38,696
I'm going to set up my

701
00:29:38,816 --> 00:29:40,046
and add it to my view.

702
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:44,346
Later, when that thing is

703
00:29:45,386 --> 00:29:48,626
We'll go on and find our main

704
00:29:48,626 --> 00:29:50,866
that LargeElementViewController

705
00:29:50,866 --> 00:29:52,216
identifier largeElement.

706
00:29:53,066 --> 00:29:57,606
Finally, all we have to

707
00:29:57,816 --> 00:29:59,246
In the

708
00:29:59,376 --> 00:30:01,066
it's a little more

709
00:29:59,376 --> 00:30:01,066
it's a little more

710
00:30:01,066 --> 00:30:02,926
to know are we being

711
00:30:03,286 --> 00:30:05,486
If it's being presented,

712
00:30:05,566 --> 00:30:06,466
If it's not, we don't.

713
00:30:07,246 --> 00:30:08,936
So I'll put this code

714
00:30:09,436 --> 00:30:11,546
I'm doing that because I

715
00:30:12,066 --> 00:30:15,076
isBeingPresented to find out

716
00:30:16,126 --> 00:30:18,456
So if it is, then I add

717
00:30:18,456 --> 00:30:19,346
the same way as before.

718
00:30:19,926 --> 00:30:22,146
When that's tapped, all

719
00:30:24,876 --> 00:30:27,226
So now let's get on to the

720
00:30:27,226 --> 00:30:30,526
And I'm going to add

721
00:30:30,566 --> 00:30:35,696
to make this easier

722
00:30:35,876 --> 00:30:37,846
We'll call this the

723
00:30:38,286 --> 00:30:41,086
And the design object

724
00:30:41,086 --> 00:30:44,626
up all the information that

725
00:30:45,216 --> 00:30:48,316
I'll make it an immutable

726
00:30:48,446 --> 00:30:50,416
So I can write a function

727
00:30:50,416 --> 00:30:52,386
and after it's been

728
00:30:52,386 --> 00:30:53,296
Nobody can change it.

729
00:30:53,606 --> 00:30:56,566
And then finally, I'll

730
00:30:56,566 --> 00:30:59,816
So I can see is my design

731
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:01,036
than what I'm currently

732
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:01,036
than what I'm currently

733
00:31:02,296 --> 00:31:03,856
So let's actually

734
00:31:04,476 --> 00:31:06,966
I've got just a simple

735
00:31:07,486 --> 00:31:09,426
It's going to have two

736
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:11,186
The first one is the axis.

737
00:31:11,606 --> 00:31:13,436
I'm reusing this

738
00:31:13,436 --> 00:31:15,036
so it's either vertical

739
00:31:16,216 --> 00:31:18,636
Then I'm going to

740
00:31:18,636 --> 00:31:21,146
for whether I'm using the small

741
00:31:21,146 --> 00:31:22,356
of the view controllers inside.

742
00:31:22,516 --> 00:31:23,706
I call that elementKind.

743
00:31:24,866 --> 00:31:27,946
Finally, I've got a read-only

744
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:29,426
called elementIdentifier.

745
00:31:29,806 --> 00:31:32,116
And this just tells me

746
00:31:32,116 --> 00:31:34,146
to make those view

747
00:31:36,176 --> 00:31:39,406
Finally, I'll implement the

748
00:31:39,786 --> 00:31:41,326
This is just function

749
00:31:41,326 --> 00:31:43,706
And I just compare the

750
00:31:43,706 --> 00:31:46,566
to see if they're the same.

751
00:31:46,756 --> 00:31:48,986
So finally, let's get up into

752
00:31:48,986 --> 00:31:50,376
and actually do this stuff.

753
00:31:50,376 --> 00:31:51,056
You'll remember it's going

754
00:31:51,056 --> 00:31:52,666
to have three child

755
00:31:53,196 --> 00:31:55,886
It's going to use

756
00:31:55,886 --> 00:31:57,326
and decide what design to use.

757
00:31:58,106 --> 00:31:59,286
And then finally we'll update.

758
00:31:59,286 --> 00:32:02,126
Every layout will

759
00:31:59,286 --> 00:32:02,126
Every layout will

760
00:32:02,126 --> 00:32:03,416
and change things if we need to.

761
00:32:04,316 --> 00:32:04,796
So here we go.

762
00:32:05,526 --> 00:32:07,056
The

763
00:32:07,056 --> 00:32:08,986
I've got an array

764
00:32:08,986 --> 00:32:10,746
for three optional

765
00:32:11,366 --> 00:32:12,336
And they start out as nil.

766
00:32:12,336 --> 00:32:14,016
Because when this thing

767
00:32:14,016 --> 00:32:16,146
nothing is going to

768
00:32:17,056 --> 00:32:19,186
I'll also keep track

769
00:32:19,186 --> 00:32:20,446
that I'm currently displaying.

770
00:32:20,646 --> 00:32:22,216
And also that's optional

771
00:32:22,216 --> 00:32:23,396
because nothing has

772
00:32:24,846 --> 00:32:26,616
So, in my

773
00:32:26,656 --> 00:32:28,146
this should look

774
00:32:28,396 --> 00:32:29,546
I'm going to get my size.

775
00:32:30,176 --> 00:32:33,666
I'm going to call a function

776
00:32:33,666 --> 00:32:35,906
on the size, return

777
00:32:36,766 --> 00:32:38,166
And if that design is different

778
00:32:38,166 --> 00:32:39,456
than what I'm currently

779
00:32:39,516 --> 00:32:41,446
I'm going to apply

780
00:32:41,856 --> 00:32:43,216
So change my UI to match.

781
00:32:44,116 --> 00:32:47,136
So you'll note this

782
00:32:47,136 --> 00:32:48,236
that I talked about earlier.

783
00:32:48,866 --> 00:32:51,426
And really, no matter

784
00:32:51,746 --> 00:32:53,456
you can probably follow

785
00:32:53,826 --> 00:32:55,426
You'll have different

786
00:32:55,986 --> 00:32:57,116
Your decideDesign

787
00:32:57,116 --> 00:32:58,936
and applyDesign methods

788
00:32:59,516 --> 00:33:02,916
But you'll probably be following

789
00:32:59,516 --> 00:33:02,916
But you'll probably be following

790
00:33:03,756 --> 00:33:05,986
So let's fill in these

791
00:33:06,796 --> 00:33:11,046
decideDesign will first

792
00:33:11,046 --> 00:33:13,526
And we've already been over

793
00:33:14,036 --> 00:33:16,456
For the elementKind I'm going

794
00:33:16,836 --> 00:33:20,386
So I'm going to choose

795
00:33:20,386 --> 00:33:22,806
than a threshold, choose

796
00:33:22,806 --> 00:33:24,066
Otherwise use the large ones.

797
00:33:24,666 --> 00:33:26,466
And here I'm just

798
00:33:26,516 --> 00:33:28,616
This is just an example

799
00:33:28,616 --> 00:33:30,956
This isn't a value you should

800
00:33:30,956 --> 00:33:31,756
It's just an example.

801
00:33:33,096 --> 00:33:36,106
Finally, I'm going to wrap up

802
00:33:36,106 --> 00:33:38,126
in a design object

803
00:33:39,116 --> 00:33:42,436
To apply a design, I need

804
00:33:42,436 --> 00:33:44,196
So I need to find out

805
00:33:44,686 --> 00:33:46,216
So again, for the

806
00:33:46,216 --> 00:33:47,386
that directly to the stack view.

807
00:33:47,386 --> 00:33:47,896
It's smart.

808
00:33:47,896 --> 00:33:49,426
It won't do anything

809
00:33:50,626 --> 00:33:52,446
For the elementKind,

810
00:33:53,616 --> 00:33:57,146
If we have old element

811
00:33:57,396 --> 00:33:59,206
and the element kind is

812
00:33:59,206 --> 00:34:01,276
to destroy the old ones

813
00:33:59,206 --> 00:34:01,276
to destroy the old ones

814
00:34:01,726 --> 00:34:02,746
So here's how we'll do that.

815
00:34:03,866 --> 00:34:05,106
We'll iterate through

816
00:34:05,256 --> 00:34:07,386
And I'm using this

817
00:34:07,386 --> 00:34:09,556
because it lets me get

818
00:34:09,556 --> 00:34:11,746
at that index simultaneously

819
00:34:13,146 --> 00:34:15,856
And finally, if we've got an

820
00:34:16,306 --> 00:34:17,116
then I need to remove it.

821
00:34:17,116 --> 00:34:18,456
I'll call this function

822
00:34:19,716 --> 00:34:22,485
Go to my storyboard, create

823
00:34:22,485 --> 00:34:24,585
using the identifier

824
00:34:24,866 --> 00:34:26,835
And then finally call

825
00:34:26,835 --> 00:34:28,065
that new child view controller.

826
00:34:28,646 --> 00:34:31,996
And then save it in the array

827
00:34:33,516 --> 00:34:35,016
So, last slide of code.

828
00:34:35,016 --> 00:34:36,005
Thank you for sticking with me.

829
00:34:36,476 --> 00:34:37,916
These are some things

830
00:34:37,916 --> 00:34:40,036
to be a well-behaved

831
00:34:40,156 --> 00:34:42,656
So it's important to do these

832
00:34:43,466 --> 00:34:44,815
When we're adding a

833
00:34:44,815 --> 00:34:47,005
we first call

834
00:34:47,106 --> 00:34:48,255
This adds that view controller

835
00:34:48,255 --> 00:34:52,775
as to self's list

836
00:34:53,826 --> 00:34:56,896
Then we need to add that

837
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:57,746
to the view hierarchy.

838
00:34:58,656 --> 00:35:00,956
We do this by using

839
00:34:58,656 --> 00:35:00,956
We do this by using

840
00:35:01,026 --> 00:35:02,616
addArrangedSubviews method.

841
00:35:02,706 --> 00:35:04,716
And UIKit doesn't

842
00:35:04,716 --> 00:35:06,976
And in fact, can't do it for

843
00:35:06,976 --> 00:35:09,656
where it's going to go

844
00:35:09,766 --> 00:35:11,486
Only you can tell us that.

845
00:35:12,176 --> 00:35:13,796
Finally, once that's done,

846
00:35:13,976 --> 00:35:16,086
you tell that view

847
00:35:16,086 --> 00:35:18,026
to a new parent view

848
00:35:19,116 --> 00:35:22,426
To remove the old one, we

849
00:35:22,456 --> 00:35:23,426
just in the opposite order.

850
00:35:23,836 --> 00:35:25,276
So we tell it it will move

851
00:35:25,276 --> 00:35:27,006
to a new parent view

852
00:35:27,956 --> 00:35:29,566
Remove its view from

853
00:35:30,226 --> 00:35:32,336
And then finally, remove

854
00:35:33,086 --> 00:35:34,236
of child view controllers.

855
00:35:34,516 --> 00:35:36,876
So here we are.

856
00:35:36,876 --> 00:35:38,606
I'll actually show

857
00:35:39,156 --> 00:35:41,576
Here we are on the

858
00:35:41,936 --> 00:35:43,026
We've got lots of room.

859
00:35:43,126 --> 00:35:44,676
We're using that

860
00:35:44,746 --> 00:35:46,796
and we're using the

861
00:35:47,606 --> 00:35:49,206
Now, if I slide over another app

862
00:35:49,206 --> 00:35:53,306
and pin it, my app's

863
00:35:53,336 --> 00:35:54,806
I switched to that

864
00:35:54,806 --> 00:35:57,146
But I'm using those

865
00:35:57,146 --> 00:35:57,436
still.

866
00:35:57,626 --> 00:35:59,676
In fact, they're the same

867
00:35:59,676 --> 00:36:00,726
that we were looking at earlier.

868
00:35:59,676 --> 00:36:00,726
that we were looking at earlier.

869
00:36:01,896 --> 00:36:04,436
Now, if I make that

870
00:36:04,436 --> 00:36:08,876
you'll note that we switch

871
00:36:08,966 --> 00:36:09,946
So we're still vertical.

872
00:36:10,196 --> 00:36:11,706
We are using that

873
00:36:12,206 --> 00:36:14,916
I can now tap on one of

874
00:36:14,966 --> 00:36:15,866
present the large one.

875
00:36:16,046 --> 00:36:18,886
If I tap again, we'll

876
00:36:19,796 --> 00:36:20,736
So there's my app.

877
00:36:21,216 --> 00:36:23,006
You'll note that we

878
00:36:23,006 --> 00:36:25,796
We really decided exactly what

879
00:36:26,536 --> 00:36:29,006
I handled designs of

880
00:36:30,256 --> 00:36:31,806
I implemented each design.

881
00:36:31,806 --> 00:36:33,266
We changed between

882
00:36:33,856 --> 00:36:35,006
as the app changed size,

883
00:36:35,816 --> 00:36:38,066
and also used reusable

884
00:36:39,076 --> 00:36:40,626
So my app is an example of this.

885
00:36:40,626 --> 00:36:42,326
Your app can do all

886
00:36:44,316 --> 00:36:46,056
So now we've been

887
00:36:46,056 --> 00:36:48,496
We've shown you what

888
00:36:48,656 --> 00:36:51,286
We've shown you some of

889
00:36:51,286 --> 00:36:54,196
that UIKit provides in this

890
00:36:54,196 --> 00:36:56,956
And we've been through

891
00:36:57,426 --> 00:36:59,636
So, we've really barely

892
00:36:59,636 --> 00:37:00,696
There's a lot more to go.

893
00:36:59,636 --> 00:37:00,696
There's a lot more to go.

894
00:37:01,076 --> 00:37:03,756
So, check out our

895
00:37:04,816 --> 00:37:07,716
Also, if you didn't see

896
00:37:08,016 --> 00:37:10,046
There was a great talk

897
00:37:10,046 --> 00:37:11,326
that talked about typography.

898
00:37:11,406 --> 00:37:15,136
New stuff in Collection

899
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:16,666
that David mentioned earlier.

900
00:37:17,186 --> 00:37:19,916
And then also the last two

901
00:37:19,916 --> 00:37:21,796
about adaptive apps

902
00:37:22,106 --> 00:37:24,676
And we really didn't duplicate

903
00:37:24,716 --> 00:37:26,196
So, please review that stuff.

904
00:37:26,416 --> 00:37:28,586
There's a lot of great

905
00:37:29,146 --> 00:37:30,146
So thank you.

906
00:37:30,286 --> 00:37:31,346
Have a fantastic Friday.
