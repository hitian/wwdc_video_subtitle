&gt;&gt; So, good morning, everyone.

4
00:00:33,966 --> 00:00:35,016
So, my name is Tom Witkin,

5
00:00:35,016 --> 00:00:37,136
and I'm an Engineer here

6
00:00:37,486 --> 00:00:39,006
And this morning, we're

7
00:00:39,006 --> 00:00:40,316
about building quick

8
00:00:40,316 --> 00:00:41,736
into your Apple Watch apps.

9
00:00:42,336 --> 00:00:44,186
And first off, we'd like to

10
00:00:44,946 --> 00:00:46,936
what do we even mean

11
00:00:47,676 --> 00:00:49,656
So I'm sure that many of

12
00:00:49,656 --> 00:00:51,636
for iOS or for Mac OS.

13
00:00:52,176 --> 00:00:54,786
And on those platforms, we're

14
00:00:54,786 --> 00:00:57,416
of time a user is spending

15
00:00:57,416 --> 00:00:59,056
of minutes or even hours.

16
00:00:59,456 --> 00:01:01,476
But in watchOS, it's

17
00:00:59,456 --> 00:01:01,476
But in watchOS, it's

18
00:01:01,476 --> 00:01:04,296
A user wants to be able to raise

19
00:01:04,336 --> 00:01:07,036
to specific information or

20
00:01:07,336 --> 00:01:08,606
and then drop their

21
00:01:08,606 --> 00:01:09,506
to whatever they were doing.

22
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:12,076
And so the interaction

23
00:01:12,746 --> 00:01:13,626
So here are some examples

24
00:01:13,626 --> 00:01:15,536
of what a quick interaction

25
00:01:17,216 --> 00:01:23,516
So, for example, starting a

26
00:01:27,396 --> 00:01:29,576
or marking an item

27
00:01:30,156 --> 00:01:33,366
And so we think that these are

28
00:01:33,366 --> 00:01:34,886
of interactions on Apple Watch,

29
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:36,766
and there are some key

30
00:01:36,766 --> 00:01:37,806
that you've probably

31
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:40,686
So, first off, apps

32
00:01:40,826 --> 00:01:41,796
they need to be glanceable.

33
00:01:41,906 --> 00:01:43,406
Which means that,

34
00:01:43,696 --> 00:01:46,046
your users should be able to get

35
00:01:46,676 --> 00:01:48,546
Apps need to be actionable,

36
00:01:48,846 --> 00:01:51,296
which means that your users

37
00:01:51,536 --> 00:01:52,816
and well-informed decisions.

38
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:55,226
And lastly, they

39
00:01:55,286 --> 00:01:57,066
You should never be

40
00:01:57,066 --> 00:01:59,866
And if you're interested in

41
00:01:59,866 --> 00:02:01,166
I highly recommend

42
00:01:59,866 --> 00:02:01,166

of the What's New in

00:02:09,746 --> 00:02:11,996
And so now we know a

47
00:02:11,996 --> 00:02:12,936
by a quick interaction.

48
00:02:13,356 --> 00:02:17,116
But how long is a quick

49
00:02:17,986 --> 00:02:19,896
And so we think that

50
00:02:19,896 --> 00:02:23,586
of interaction is

51
00:02:23,946 --> 00:02:24,666
So, 2 seconds.

52
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:25,816
That's not very long at all.

53
00:02:25,816 --> 00:02:29,186
And so you have to be very

54
00:02:29,246 --> 00:02:30,626
and build your applications.

55
00:02:30,926 --> 00:02:32,896
But we think that it's

56
00:02:32,896 --> 00:02:35,236
especially with all the

57
00:02:35,436 --> 00:02:37,276
that we've added in watchOS 3.

58
00:02:37,946 --> 00:02:39,236
And so that's how we're

59
00:02:39,236 --> 00:02:41,476
is by talking about these

60
00:02:41,476 --> 00:02:43,506

61
00:02:43,506 --> 00:02:46,036
at some practical techniques

00:02:46,236 --> 00:02:48,206
to build these types

63
00:02:48,846 --> 00:02:51,046
And with that, I'd like to hand

64
00:02:51,266 --> 00:02:52,836

00:03:01,246 --> 00:03:03,956
that we're introducing

to implement quick interactions.

74
00:03:10,296 --> 00:03:12,836
to make your apps glanceable,

75
00:03:13,976 --> 00:03:17,266
The first has to do with

76
00:03:17,266 --> 00:03:18,336
to new kinds of input.

77
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:20,436
You can now do gestures

78
00:03:20,436 --> 00:03:22,176
with gesture recognizers

79
00:03:23,686 --> 00:03:24,806
We are giving you access

80
00:03:24,806 --> 00:03:27,036
to the rotation events

81
00:03:28,696 --> 00:03:31,796
And we're also having

82
00:03:32,366 --> 00:03:35,006
One is for improved

83
00:03:35,546 --> 00:03:38,456
the support for the new

84
00:03:38,816 --> 00:03:41,526
as well as integration with

85
00:03:42,446 --> 00:03:43,496
So let's jump right in.

86
00:03:44,196 --> 00:03:46,376
I'll be giving you an

87
00:03:46,376 --> 00:03:49,326
and then Tom will come back

88
00:03:49,326 --> 00:03:51,526
of how he combines

89
00:03:52,536 --> 00:03:56,236
So if you have used

90
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,876
you pretty much already

91
00:03:58,876 --> 00:04:01,246
for gesture recognition

92
00:03:58,876 --> 00:04:01,246
for gesture recognition

93
00:04:01,246 --> 00:04:04,546
If you haven't, gesture

94
00:04:05,086 --> 00:04:07,596
that help you parse the

95
00:04:07,656 --> 00:04:09,886
into recognizable gestures.

96
00:04:10,516 --> 00:04:13,246
We're writing support

97
00:04:13,276 --> 00:04:18,736
Two discretes -- the

98
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:20,995
And two continuous

99
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:27,786
the PanGesture, and

100
00:04:29,106 --> 00:04:32,286
So the way you use this, like

101
00:04:32,286 --> 00:04:35,316
in WatchKit, is an interface

102
00:04:36,106 --> 00:04:38,826
You are dragging the

103
00:04:39,406 --> 00:04:40,836
So if you look at the library,

104
00:04:40,836 --> 00:04:43,546
you can now see four

105
00:04:43,926 --> 00:04:46,316
These are dragged into

106
00:04:46,716 --> 00:04:48,336
to have gestures

107
00:04:48,996 --> 00:04:51,226
And you do the configuration

108
00:04:51,226 --> 00:04:52,086
in the inspector.

109
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:56,426
The last thing you do is drag

110
00:04:56,426 --> 00:04:58,726
into a function within

111
00:04:59,186 --> 00:05:00,686
This is a function

112
00:04:59,186 --> 00:05:00,686
This is a function

113
00:05:00,686 --> 00:05:02,766
when the gesture is

114
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:04,256
As you can see, one

115
00:05:04,256 --> 00:05:07,066
of the parameters is the

116
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:10,586
From it, you can

117
00:05:11,256 --> 00:05:13,286
where the gesture

118
00:05:13,286 --> 00:05:15,476
the bounds of the object,

119
00:05:15,476 --> 00:05:16,646
that the gesture is in.

120
00:05:18,076 --> 00:05:20,686
So, a few words about

121
00:05:21,826 --> 00:05:25,366
Gestures begin in the possible

122
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:26,506
and they can transition either

123
00:05:26,506 --> 00:05:28,476
to a recognized or

124
00:05:28,986 --> 00:05:30,836
When you're dealing

125
00:05:30,886 --> 00:05:33,256
you really don't think too

126
00:05:33,606 --> 00:05:36,616
All you need to know is that

127
00:05:36,616 --> 00:05:37,996
your action method is called.

128
00:05:39,186 --> 00:05:42,066
This is slightly different

129
00:05:42,796 --> 00:05:44,806
They also begin in

130
00:05:45,006 --> 00:05:48,766
But as their name

131
00:05:48,766 --> 00:05:51,456
over multiple updates

132
00:05:51,456 --> 00:05:54,986
So just assume that your action

133
00:05:54,986 --> 00:05:58,526
times as your gesture is

134
00:05:58,526 --> 00:06:00,116
to update your user interface.

135
00:05:58,526 --> 00:06:00,116
to update your user interface.

136
00:06:01,616 --> 00:06:04,836
Some tips for using

137
00:06:05,966 --> 00:06:09,016
We recommend that

138
00:06:09,016 --> 00:06:11,236
to the group elements

139
00:06:11,236 --> 00:06:13,196
You can do that, but you

140
00:06:13,196 --> 00:06:15,516
of the gestures that are

141
00:06:16,366 --> 00:06:19,126
And remember that you have

142
00:06:19,126 --> 00:06:21,606
in the Watch app,

143
00:06:21,606 --> 00:06:24,226
to be the bigger interface

144
00:06:25,866 --> 00:06:29,086
You can still set dependency

145
00:06:29,826 --> 00:06:33,026
But for watchOS, this is only

146
00:06:33,026 --> 00:06:35,656
and interface builder.

147
00:06:35,806 --> 00:06:37,596
And be mindful that some

148
00:06:37,596 --> 00:06:39,726
of the system gestures

149
00:06:39,726 --> 00:06:41,266
over the gestures

150
00:06:42,326 --> 00:06:45,236
For example, if you

151
00:06:45,236 --> 00:06:48,876
that already has scrolling

152
00:06:48,876 --> 00:06:51,976
to attach a SwipeDown gesture,

153
00:06:51,976 --> 00:06:53,336
The scrolling will

154
00:06:53,886 --> 00:06:56,276
The same thing for the

155
00:06:58,226 --> 00:07:00,166
Now let's move onto our

156
00:06:58,226 --> 00:07:00,166
Now let's move onto our

157
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:01,416
the Digital Crown.

158
00:07:02,346 --> 00:07:05,596
This is a unique element

159
00:07:05,736 --> 00:07:09,726
that allows your users quick and

160
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:12,976
You've had access to the

161
00:07:13,356 --> 00:07:15,466
through the WKInterfacePicker

162
00:07:16,856 --> 00:07:19,176
To use that, you

163
00:07:19,176 --> 00:07:21,406
of picker items and

164
00:07:22,866 --> 00:07:25,246
And WatchKit takes care of

165
00:07:25,246 --> 00:07:26,526
Here is the list style.

166
00:07:26,656 --> 00:07:31,676
You have the stacks style

167
00:07:32,266 --> 00:07:36,676
But for this element,

168
00:07:36,676 --> 00:07:38,216
of a lot of stuff for you.

169
00:07:38,216 --> 00:07:40,416
We're drawing the

170
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:42,786
of interpreting the

171
00:07:42,786 --> 00:07:45,836
and we're simply calling your

172
00:07:46,956 --> 00:07:50,036
So, in watchOS 3, we are

173
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:53,456
to the rotation events so

174
00:07:53,456 --> 00:07:56,106
elements and drive them

175
00:07:58,016 --> 00:08:00,346
This is achieved

176
00:07:58,016 --> 00:08:00,346
This is achieved

177
00:08:00,406 --> 00:08:03,446
through new classes we're

178
00:08:03,446 --> 00:08:05,666
which gives you access

179
00:08:06,596 --> 00:08:08,076
I'm sorry, the rotations

180
00:08:08,346 --> 00:08:11,216
And the new delegate

181
00:08:11,606 --> 00:08:13,626
with callbacks on

182
00:08:14,326 --> 00:08:16,706
So you have two kinds of

183
00:08:16,706 --> 00:08:19,326
rotations per second

184
00:08:19,986 --> 00:08:22,496
What do you do with each one of

185
00:08:23,286 --> 00:08:26,016
If you're interested in

186
00:08:26,676 --> 00:08:29,056
you want to access the

187
00:08:29,056 --> 00:08:30,376
which is now present in all

188
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:32,135
of the interface

189
00:08:33,256 --> 00:08:36,996
And you query its rotations

190
00:08:37,366 --> 00:08:39,066
This is probably something

191
00:08:39,066 --> 00:08:41,686
when you're interested in the

192
00:08:41,856 --> 00:08:43,816
in maybe a physics-based

193
00:08:43,816 --> 00:08:47,796
a game, something like that.

194
00:08:47,796 --> 00:08:50,456
Rotational deltas are

195
00:08:50,456 --> 00:08:51,786
through the delegate protocol.

196
00:08:52,346 --> 00:08:55,936
This is how you're able to

197
00:08:55,936 --> 00:08:56,806
has rotated.

198
00:08:57,736 --> 00:09:00,466
So you will get a callback

199
00:08:57,736 --> 00:09:00,466
So you will get a callback

200
00:09:00,696 --> 00:09:02,276
You will have the

201
00:09:02,276 --> 00:09:03,626
as one of its arguments.

202
00:09:05,536 --> 00:09:07,746
And what you want to do

203
00:09:07,746 --> 00:09:09,646
to maintain an accumulator

204
00:09:09,736 --> 00:09:12,296
where you add the deltas

205
00:09:13,186 --> 00:09:17,256
The math you want to use

206
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:19,066
to accumulated deltas of 1.

207
00:09:20,786 --> 00:09:22,726
Another example is if

208
00:09:22,726 --> 00:09:26,326
in detecting half rotations, you

209
00:09:26,636 --> 00:09:28,906
So you're adding the deltas

210
00:09:28,906 --> 00:09:30,646
And when they cross

211
00:09:30,646 --> 00:09:32,426
you know that a rotation

212
00:09:33,966 --> 00:09:35,806
It's really up to you to figure

213
00:09:35,806 --> 00:09:39,196
out how these rotation counts

214
00:09:39,196 --> 00:09:40,736
of the content that

215
00:09:43,836 --> 00:09:47,126
When we're communicating values

216
00:09:47,276 --> 00:09:48,566
either positive or negative.

217
00:09:49,346 --> 00:09:51,986
When your users are

218
00:09:51,986 --> 00:09:53,316
of moving their content up,

219
00:09:53,316 --> 00:09:55,586
we will be giving

220
00:09:56,106 --> 00:09:57,506
And when they're

221
00:09:57,506 --> 00:09:58,646
to moving the content down,

222
00:09:58,646 --> 00:09:59,976
we're giving you

223
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:03,756
And these values are orientation

224
00:10:03,796 --> 00:10:05,556
to worry about what

225
00:10:05,556 --> 00:10:06,486
or clockwise means.

226
00:10:06,486 --> 00:10:12,376
If your users change their Crown

227
00:10:12,376 --> 00:10:15,946
to give you a positive value

228
00:10:15,946 --> 00:10:19,216
and down, so you don't

229
00:10:19,336 --> 00:10:21,766
Finally, there's a concept

230
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:25,666
The focus can be taken away

231
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:29,116
for example, a picker, a

232
00:10:29,486 --> 00:10:31,426
So it's up to you to determine

233
00:10:31,426 --> 00:10:33,746
when your interface

234
00:10:33,746 --> 00:10:35,026
to be the focus of the Crown.

235
00:10:35,496 --> 00:10:38,436
This is a great place to

236
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:44,246
And once you determine that

237
00:10:44,246 --> 00:10:47,286
in focus again, please

238
00:10:47,356 --> 00:10:49,336
And don't forget to

239
00:10:49,336 --> 00:10:54,366
when your interface

240
00:10:55,606 --> 00:10:59,046
Now let's put aside the input

241
00:10:59,046 --> 00:11:01,466
about the vertical paging

242
00:10:59,046 --> 00:11:01,466
about the vertical paging

243
00:11:03,156 --> 00:11:08,216
The typical way that your users

244
00:11:08,216 --> 00:11:10,626
by selecting a row

245
00:11:10,626 --> 00:11:12,576
for that particular row

246
00:11:13,376 --> 00:11:15,986
They need to navigate

247
00:11:16,296 --> 00:11:21,056
to select another row before

248
00:11:21,226 --> 00:11:24,876
In watchOS 3, we have the

249
00:11:25,286 --> 00:11:28,976
So when you enable this in

250
00:11:28,976 --> 00:11:33,246
into their first detail, they're

251
00:11:33,246 --> 00:11:35,176
or with the Crown up and down

252
00:11:35,176 --> 00:11:37,286
and see the subsequent

253
00:11:38,256 --> 00:11:42,126
So this eliminates their need to

254
00:11:42,746 --> 00:11:44,936
making your app seem

255
00:11:46,376 --> 00:11:48,086
So how do you opt

256
00:11:48,366 --> 00:11:49,866
It's actually pretty

257
00:11:49,866 --> 00:11:53,786
All you need to do is enable

258
00:11:53,826 --> 00:11:56,266
in your table inspector.

259
00:11:56,266 --> 00:11:57,946
But you also need to make sure

260
00:11:57,946 --> 00:12:01,306
that your table is

261
00:11:57,946 --> 00:12:01,306
that your table is

262
00:12:02,016 --> 00:12:04,456
That's where you're giving

263
00:12:04,456 --> 00:12:06,916
to instantiate a controller

264
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:07,846
with the given context.

265
00:12:07,846 --> 00:12:09,586
You're probably already

266
00:12:10,856 --> 00:12:13,426
So the API itself

267
00:12:13,426 --> 00:12:15,116
There's a couple of changes.

268
00:12:15,196 --> 00:12:17,726
There's a single method

269
00:12:17,726 --> 00:12:19,686
into the segue mode from code.

270
00:12:20,376 --> 00:12:22,716
This is useful when you're

271
00:12:22,716 --> 00:12:26,686
from tapping on a complication

272
00:12:26,686 --> 00:12:28,366
and you want to directly go

273
00:12:28,366 --> 00:12:31,146
into a specific row

274
00:12:32,736 --> 00:12:36,676
The second thing you need to be

275
00:12:36,676 --> 00:12:37,806
to be smart and help you

276
00:12:37,806 --> 00:12:39,356
out with the speed

277
00:12:39,356 --> 00:12:41,396
So we're doing preheating

278
00:12:41,396 --> 00:12:43,586
anticipating what the

279
00:12:43,586 --> 00:12:44,696
of scrolling up and down.

280
00:12:45,256 --> 00:12:47,006
So some of the lifecycle methods

281
00:12:47,006 --> 00:12:50,466
for your controllers will be

282
00:12:50,466 --> 00:12:51,066
on screen.

283
00:12:51,936 --> 00:12:54,206
I won't be going too much

284
00:12:54,206 --> 00:12:57,506
But we have a whole new session,

285
00:12:57,506 --> 00:12:59,416
where they give a

286
00:12:59,506 --> 00:13:01,976
on all the badging of

287
00:12:59,506 --> 00:13:01,976
on all the badging of

288
00:13:03,486 --> 00:13:05,646
Now let's talk about

289
00:13:05,646 --> 00:13:09,186
These are the ultimate

290
00:13:09,186 --> 00:13:10,986
that we've introduced

291
00:13:11,086 --> 00:13:12,506
of the Apple Watch product.

292
00:13:14,276 --> 00:13:17,696
So from a user's point of view,

293
00:13:18,696 --> 00:13:22,526
the way they interact with

294
00:13:22,526 --> 00:13:24,446
by feeling the haptic

295
00:13:25,316 --> 00:13:28,766
They raise their wrist and

296
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:31,176
short-look interface

297
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:36,036
If they keep their hand

298
00:13:36,036 --> 00:13:38,296
into the long-look

299
00:13:41,236 --> 00:13:44,016
The way they respond to

300
00:13:44,256 --> 00:13:46,586
I'm going to walk through

301
00:13:46,586 --> 00:13:48,456
which is the one that

302
00:13:49,776 --> 00:13:52,286
So if you've done

303
00:13:52,286 --> 00:13:55,226
of communicating the

304
00:13:55,226 --> 00:13:57,866
through the text,

305
00:13:57,866 --> 00:13:59,266
than dismiss the notification.

306
00:13:59,266 --> 00:14:01,006
That is the shortest

307
00:13:59,266 --> 00:14:01,006
That is the shortest

308
00:14:02,356 --> 00:14:08,226
They could also tap on the

309
00:14:08,486 --> 00:14:13,106
Or, remember that notifications

310
00:14:13,106 --> 00:14:14,166
associated with them.

311
00:14:14,716 --> 00:14:16,236
In this case, I'm

312
00:14:16,346 --> 00:14:18,426
the Accept, Maybe,

313
00:14:18,726 --> 00:14:20,456
You can have up to

314
00:14:21,456 --> 00:14:24,016
When you're associating

315
00:14:24,656 --> 00:14:26,896
they can either be

316
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:29,536
meaning that if the

317
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:33,246
your application will become

318
00:14:34,306 --> 00:14:38,426
Background actions in watchOS

319
00:14:38,426 --> 00:14:39,056
to your phone.

320
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:45,756
The big change in watchOS

321
00:14:45,756 --> 00:14:49,086
that there's a whole new

322
00:14:50,786 --> 00:14:53,776
Please go to the Introduction

323
00:14:53,776 --> 00:14:57,206
to learn all of the details

324
00:14:57,206 --> 00:15:00,036
But the high-level

325
00:14:57,206 --> 00:15:00,036
But the high-level

326
00:15:00,036 --> 00:15:01,936
as WatchKit developers

327
00:15:04,256 --> 00:15:08,366
You now have a set of

328
00:15:08,366 --> 00:15:11,716
across platforms --

329
00:15:13,456 --> 00:15:16,826
You can now schedule local

330
00:15:18,996 --> 00:15:20,916
And notifications

331
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:24,106
with background actions will now

332
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:26,936
as long as they were

333
00:15:30,116 --> 00:15:33,246
Let's look at the API.

334
00:15:33,246 --> 00:15:35,806
The new object,

335
00:15:36,056 --> 00:15:38,816
you want to become the

336
00:15:38,816 --> 00:15:40,356
when your application

337
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:42,126
in the

338
00:15:42,126 --> 00:15:42,506
method.

339
00:15:43,536 --> 00:15:44,586
And you want to indicate

340
00:15:44,586 --> 00:15:47,526
that you are adopting

341
00:15:47,526 --> 00:15:48,526
delegate protocol.

342
00:15:49,296 --> 00:15:50,746
There are two methods

343
00:15:50,746 --> 00:15:51,906
to you in this protocol.

344
00:15:52,256 --> 00:15:54,206
The first is the

345
00:15:54,986 --> 00:15:57,666
This is called when your

346
00:15:58,546 --> 00:16:03,216
on the watch face and the system

347
00:15:58,546 --> 00:16:03,216
on the watch face and the system

348
00:16:03,216 --> 00:16:05,936
to tell it how you want it

349
00:16:06,746 --> 00:16:09,166
So, depending on the

350
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:10,736
in the completion handler there,

351
00:16:11,276 --> 00:16:13,206
the system will do

352
00:16:14,446 --> 00:16:17,026
If you say that you want

353
00:16:17,756 --> 00:16:21,406
we will revert back to the

354
00:16:21,406 --> 00:16:25,186
for the notification and it will

355
00:16:25,546 --> 00:16:27,716
If you say that you

356
00:16:27,716 --> 00:16:29,916
that means that system

357
00:16:30,616 --> 00:16:32,196
Since your app is

358
00:16:32,336 --> 00:16:33,736
you are the ones taking care

359
00:16:33,736 --> 00:16:36,236
of displaying the

360
00:16:36,236 --> 00:16:37,446
in your application.

361
00:16:38,766 --> 00:16:41,666
The second method is

362
00:16:42,486 --> 00:16:44,996
This is when your users

363
00:16:45,906 --> 00:16:48,806
So this is the callback when

364
00:16:48,806 --> 00:16:50,336
because the user

365
00:16:50,606 --> 00:16:54,406
And this is also the new

366
00:16:54,406 --> 00:16:57,306
where you're getting a

367
00:16:57,786 --> 00:16:59,806
But, remember, this is

368
00:16:59,806 --> 00:17:01,836
that are scheduled

369
00:16:59,806 --> 00:17:01,836
that are scheduled

370
00:17:03,736 --> 00:17:06,906
This is a good moment to make a

371
00:17:06,906 --> 00:17:10,026
and delivery of notifications

372
00:17:11,106 --> 00:17:15,526
Anytime a notification fires

373
00:17:15,526 --> 00:17:18,606
to the Watch if the

374
00:17:18,606 --> 00:17:21,175
and you have your Watch on

375
00:17:21,806 --> 00:17:23,675
That's always been the behavior.

376
00:17:25,076 --> 00:17:27,656
But now in watchOS 3,

377
00:17:27,656 --> 00:17:29,416
to schedule your

378
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:30,426
on the Apple Watch.

379
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:34,236
So keep in mind that these are

380
00:17:34,646 --> 00:17:36,206
And if your application needs

381
00:17:36,206 --> 00:17:40,126
to also have a corresponding

382
00:17:40,496 --> 00:17:42,626
it's up to you to

383
00:17:42,956 --> 00:17:44,706
and schedule your

384
00:17:45,566 --> 00:17:46,586
Now you might be wondering,

385
00:17:46,586 --> 00:17:48,526
"If I schedule multiple

386
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:50,036
what happens when

387
00:17:51,326 --> 00:17:55,476
Well, you have the ability to

388
00:17:55,476 --> 00:17:58,416
as you use the same identifier

389
00:17:58,416 --> 00:18:00,386
and on the iPhone side

390
00:17:58,416 --> 00:18:00,386
and on the iPhone side

391
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:02,966
So if we're in a situation

392
00:18:02,966 --> 00:18:05,696
where we're forwarding the

393
00:18:06,816 --> 00:18:08,246
we look at the ID first.

394
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:11,746
And if there's a similar

395
00:18:11,746 --> 00:18:14,176
at that moment on the Watch,

396
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:15,286
and that's the one

397
00:18:15,286 --> 00:18:18,106
so your users don't see two

398
00:18:21,536 --> 00:18:25,646
Finally, let's talk about the

399
00:18:27,276 --> 00:18:30,886
So SpriteKit and SceneKit are

400
00:18:30,966 --> 00:18:34,196
to do the 2D and 3D

401
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:36,876
to expand significantly

402
00:18:36,876 --> 00:18:38,006
of your applications.

403
00:18:39,256 --> 00:18:42,246
We have two new classes

404
00:18:42,856 --> 00:18:48,246
that support these frameworks --

405
00:18:48,986 --> 00:18:53,646
and WKInterfaceSCNScene

406
00:18:54,176 --> 00:18:57,406
Again, you do all of the

407
00:18:57,406 --> 00:18:58,336
and interface builder.

408
00:18:59,476 --> 00:19:02,486
You will now see the two

409
00:18:59,476 --> 00:19:02,486
You will now see the two

410
00:19:02,576 --> 00:19:06,646
All you do is drag them

411
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:08,836
and they really pretty

412
00:19:08,836 --> 00:19:10,166
where you're going to

413
00:19:10,636 --> 00:19:13,706
And the configuration

414
00:19:13,706 --> 00:19:14,586
and interface builder.

415
00:19:17,496 --> 00:19:19,906
Once you're ready to

416
00:19:20,786 --> 00:19:22,056
all of your SpriteKit

417
00:19:22,056 --> 00:19:24,156
and SceneKit code

418
00:19:24,316 --> 00:19:26,316
You continue to use the APIs.

419
00:19:26,316 --> 00:19:29,196
I won't be going into the APIs

420
00:19:29,196 --> 00:19:32,866
But once you have your

421
00:19:33,446 --> 00:19:35,176
the integration with

422
00:19:35,176 --> 00:19:36,366
in the presenting of the scene.

423
00:19:37,106 --> 00:19:39,276
So if you're dealing

424
00:19:39,336 --> 00:19:43,056
you call the percent function

425
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:44,436
on whether you have

426
00:19:45,576 --> 00:19:47,456
And if you have a

427
00:19:47,896 --> 00:19:52,026
all you do is set the scene

428
00:19:52,026 --> 00:19:56,506
And that's all there is in

429
00:19:58,316 --> 00:20:00,526
So I've given you

430
00:19:58,316 --> 00:20:00,526
So I've given you

431
00:20:00,526 --> 00:20:02,856
of the new ToolKit

432
00:20:03,586 --> 00:20:05,516
for creating glanceable,

433
00:20:05,516 --> 00:20:07,856
and responsive applications.

434
00:20:08,376 --> 00:20:11,236
Now Tom will come back and

435
00:20:11,236 --> 00:20:13,806
of how he combines

436
00:20:14,526 --> 00:20:15,916
to make your app

437
00:20:16,216 --> 00:20:16,596
Thank you.

438
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:22,936
[ Applause ]

439
00:20:23,436 --> 00:20:23,726
&gt;&gt; All right.

440
00:20:23,726 --> 00:20:25,946
And so now we have that

441
00:20:25,946 --> 00:20:28,556
at some practical techniques

442
00:20:28,556 --> 00:20:29,476
of quick interactions.

443
00:20:30,196 --> 00:20:32,896
So we're going to talk

444
00:20:33,026 --> 00:20:34,306
and notifications in your app.

445
00:20:34,476 --> 00:20:37,196
And now these are not new, but

446
00:20:37,196 --> 00:20:38,406
in some unique and new ways.

447
00:20:38,476 --> 00:20:40,986
Then afterward, we're

448
00:20:40,986 --> 00:20:43,756
about having a simple navigation

449
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:46,016
And then lastly,

450
00:20:46,016 --> 00:20:48,516
about giving your users the

451
00:20:48,736 --> 00:20:50,486
as soon as they're

452
00:20:50,486 --> 00:20:51,266
your applications.

453
00:20:52,036 --> 00:20:54,666
And so we'll start off with

454
00:20:55,046 --> 00:20:57,606
And so we introduced

455
00:20:57,606 --> 00:20:59,326
for third-party apps

456
00:20:59,686 --> 00:21:02,146
And now in watchOS 3, they're

457
00:20:59,686 --> 00:21:02,146
And now in watchOS 3, they're

458
00:21:02,716 --> 00:21:05,636
And now there are more faces

459
00:21:06,076 --> 00:21:07,686
and there's some of

460
00:21:07,686 --> 00:21:09,416
that have even more

461
00:21:10,356 --> 00:21:13,506
So, also, now you have the

462
00:21:13,846 --> 00:21:17,606
across your faces to see

463
00:21:17,926 --> 00:21:20,456
So because of this, we

464
00:21:20,456 --> 00:21:22,636
on Apple Watch should

465
00:21:22,986 --> 00:21:25,736
And you'll now see that all the

466
00:21:25,736 --> 00:21:27,696
as well, as you can see

467
00:21:27,696 --> 00:21:29,836
or the Heartrate app.

468
00:21:29,836 --> 00:21:30,796
So why complications?

469
00:21:31,446 --> 00:21:32,586
They're extremely glanceable.

470
00:21:32,586 --> 00:21:33,976
They're on their

471
00:21:33,976 --> 00:21:35,516
And with just a glance,

472
00:21:35,516 --> 00:21:36,876
of really important information.

473
00:21:38,266 --> 00:21:39,696
They are frequently updated.

474
00:21:39,696 --> 00:21:42,276
If your app has a complication

475
00:21:42,606 --> 00:21:44,466
it's updated at least

476
00:21:44,726 --> 00:21:46,836
And so you can always ensure

477
00:21:46,836 --> 00:21:49,446
and current data always

478
00:21:50,826 --> 00:21:52,176
Your app is kept in memory.

479
00:21:52,176 --> 00:21:55,086
And this is really important

480
00:21:55,086 --> 00:21:58,146
of your app extremely fast

481
00:21:58,146 --> 00:22:00,476
within your applications

482
00:21:58,146 --> 00:22:00,476
within your applications

483
00:22:01,986 --> 00:22:03,766
And complications

484
00:22:03,766 --> 00:22:05,996
to accelerate your

485
00:22:06,296 --> 00:22:08,416
to perform specific

486
00:22:09,366 --> 00:22:12,366
So, for example, if we look

487
00:22:12,886 --> 00:22:14,626
I tap on that and

488
00:22:14,626 --> 00:22:15,646
to the Now Playing screen

489
00:22:15,646 --> 00:22:16,996
because that's what's

490
00:22:16,996 --> 00:22:18,416
to me if I'm playing music.

491
00:22:18,676 --> 00:22:21,016
I can play and pause the

492
00:22:21,396 --> 00:22:23,626
And it makes the whole

493
00:22:24,016 --> 00:22:26,076
because I'm sent

494
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:31,796
Also new in watchOS 3 and

495
00:22:31,796 --> 00:22:33,326
in the Apple Watch

496
00:22:34,026 --> 00:22:35,196
This is great because

497
00:22:35,196 --> 00:22:37,126
to add new faces to

498
00:22:37,716 --> 00:22:40,006
But it also allows you

499
00:22:40,356 --> 00:22:42,226
and choose among all

500
00:22:42,226 --> 00:22:44,696
And third-party complications

501
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:46,456
so it's a great way

502
00:22:46,456 --> 00:22:47,946
to discover your complications

503
00:22:48,156 --> 00:22:49,956
and add them directly

504
00:22:50,046 --> 00:22:53,306
And if you want to be part

505
00:22:53,306 --> 00:22:54,826
you create a complication

506
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:57,376
And there's documentation for

507
00:22:57,716 --> 00:22:59,546
So I highly recommend

508
00:23:00,386 --> 00:23:03,396
So complications on Apple Watch

509
00:23:03,396 --> 00:23:05,326
mechanism to get your

510
00:23:05,486 --> 00:23:07,686
and really provide a lot

511
00:23:07,926 --> 00:23:10,256
So if you don't have a

512
00:23:10,566 --> 00:23:14,566
or you're building a new app,

513
00:23:14,776 --> 00:23:17,666
Next up, we're going to move

514
00:23:18,076 --> 00:23:20,206
And so we all know

515
00:23:20,206 --> 00:23:22,166
on Apple Watch are

516
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:23,946
and one of the main reasons is

517
00:23:23,946 --> 00:23:26,036
that they're entirely

518
00:23:26,286 --> 00:23:29,066
And so you can make them

519
00:23:29,166 --> 00:23:30,916
But also, it allows you

520
00:23:30,996 --> 00:23:34,366
to display really valuable

521
00:23:34,366 --> 00:23:35,336
in the notification.

522
00:23:35,696 --> 00:23:37,996
So, for example, here in

523
00:23:37,996 --> 00:23:40,966
I can see the name of the event

524
00:23:41,496 --> 00:23:44,706
And ultimately, this can often

525
00:23:44,706 --> 00:23:46,366
to even go and launch

526
00:23:46,366 --> 00:23:49,406
because all the important

527
00:23:49,506 --> 00:23:50,496
in the notification.

528
00:23:51,276 --> 00:23:54,816
And now in watchOS 3, all

529
00:23:54,816 --> 00:23:57,056
and SceneKit, and inline video.

530
00:23:57,056 --> 00:23:59,996
And so you can provide even

531
00:23:59,996 --> 00:24:00,756
of your notifications.

532
00:23:59,996 --> 00:24:00,756
of your notifications.

533
00:24:01,916 --> 00:24:03,456
So, SpriteKit and SceneKit --

534
00:24:03,646 --> 00:24:06,056
I'm sure a lot of you think

535
00:24:06,206 --> 00:24:07,266
And they're great for gaming.

536
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:08,846
And there's a session on Friday

537
00:24:08,846 --> 00:24:10,476
about game technologies

538
00:24:11,156 --> 00:24:13,046
But here, we'd like to

539
00:24:13,046 --> 00:24:15,176
of nongaming types

540
00:24:15,376 --> 00:24:17,686
And so why are they

541
00:24:18,356 --> 00:24:22,246
They allow you entire

542
00:24:22,336 --> 00:24:25,226
and the layout, and the

543
00:24:25,446 --> 00:24:28,916
And so it allows you to create

544
00:24:29,326 --> 00:24:30,706
And so, here, we're

545
00:24:30,706 --> 00:24:32,536
at an example of a Photos app.

546
00:24:32,916 --> 00:24:35,256
So, here, you can see I got a

547
00:24:35,256 --> 00:24:37,506
Ivy, and she has shared

548
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:40,346
But this does not include

549
00:24:40,346 --> 00:24:41,896
I have no idea what

550
00:24:42,086 --> 00:24:44,436
I have to read the text in order

551
00:24:44,886 --> 00:24:48,056
And so we can definitely

552
00:24:48,056 --> 00:24:49,916
of the customization

553
00:24:50,146 --> 00:24:51,046
in our notification.

554
00:24:52,076 --> 00:24:52,946
So here's an alternative

555
00:24:53,246 --> 00:24:55,406
which is now using

556
00:24:55,666 --> 00:24:57,886
It actually has the photos

557
00:24:58,156 --> 00:24:59,826
It has the photo

558
00:25:00,176 --> 00:25:02,756
And with just a glance, I can

559
00:25:02,846 --> 00:25:05,836
And ultimately, I can make a

560
00:25:05,836 --> 00:25:08,606
on whether I want to go launch

561
00:25:08,606 --> 00:25:10,796
and grab my iPhone and

562
00:25:12,006 --> 00:25:14,116
And if we look at

563
00:25:14,116 --> 00:25:17,506
across the top we have the

564
00:25:18,026 --> 00:25:20,496
And then below that, we

565
00:25:20,626 --> 00:25:22,586
And the key thing I want

566
00:25:22,586 --> 00:25:25,116
that you can mix and

567
00:25:25,116 --> 00:25:26,836
and your WatchKit user

568
00:25:27,256 --> 00:25:29,986
And so maybe you already

569
00:25:29,986 --> 00:25:31,396
or the view animation API.

570
00:25:31,946 --> 00:25:34,226
You can swap those

571
00:25:34,226 --> 00:25:36,096
Or if you just have an

572
00:25:36,096 --> 00:25:38,396
to add animation, you don't

573
00:25:38,396 --> 00:25:39,516
in order to adopt SpriteKit.

574
00:25:39,956 --> 00:25:42,686
So it provides a really powerful

575
00:25:42,776 --> 00:25:45,536
to your interfaces without

576
00:25:45,536 --> 00:25:48,696
and start over, which

577
00:25:48,776 --> 00:25:50,736
And so if you have

578
00:25:50,736 --> 00:25:53,356
make sure to take full advantage

579
00:25:53,466 --> 00:25:55,506
If you just kind of have

580
00:25:55,866 --> 00:25:58,476
think about what information

581
00:25:58,476 --> 00:26:03,966
notification and add a custom

582
00:25:58,476 --> 00:26:03,966
notification and add a custom

583
00:26:03,966 --> 00:26:05,246
OK. So, next up, we're moving

584
00:26:05,246 --> 00:26:09,716
on to a simple navigation

585
00:26:09,796 --> 00:26:13,126
Earlier, we talked about the new

586
00:26:13,126 --> 00:26:15,336
And that's great for

587
00:26:15,796 --> 00:26:18,226
But here, we'd like to talk

588
00:26:18,226 --> 00:26:20,486
of two other of the technologies

589
00:26:20,906 --> 00:26:23,386
and those are Gestures

590
00:26:23,716 --> 00:26:26,736
And so the Digital Crown

591
00:26:26,736 --> 00:26:29,136
and it's a really

592
00:26:29,646 --> 00:26:30,786
It allows you to quickly

593
00:26:30,786 --> 00:26:32,556
and precisely interact

594
00:26:32,886 --> 00:26:35,436
And it can be used in

595
00:26:36,116 --> 00:26:38,956
So, for example, in the Timer

596
00:26:38,956 --> 00:26:41,416
to scrub through durations

597
00:26:42,526 --> 00:26:45,476
Or in the Photos application,

598
00:26:45,476 --> 00:26:46,846
in and out of the photo.

599
00:26:47,616 --> 00:26:49,266
So you can get really creative

600
00:26:49,266 --> 00:26:51,396
with how you use the Digital

601
00:26:51,396 --> 00:26:53,866
and we're really excited to

602
00:26:53,936 --> 00:26:55,896
And here, though, we'd like

603
00:26:55,896 --> 00:26:59,276
of a running app that puts both

604
00:26:59,366 --> 00:27:01,026
to use to simplify

605
00:26:59,366 --> 00:27:01,026
to use to simplify

606
00:27:02,276 --> 00:27:04,136
So, here, we have one

607
00:27:04,346 --> 00:27:07,316
The goal is to show my

608
00:27:07,316 --> 00:27:10,386
of the average time, and

609
00:27:11,076 --> 00:27:13,946
So one version is just to kind

610
00:27:14,046 --> 00:27:16,546
And maybe I can tap in on the

611
00:27:16,986 --> 00:27:19,376
or I can scroll the list

612
00:27:19,536 --> 00:27:22,336
And while this version

613
00:27:22,336 --> 00:27:25,126
that I would need, you kind of

614
00:27:25,126 --> 00:27:26,296
to find what you're looking for.

615
00:27:26,526 --> 00:27:28,616
You have to tap in on rows,

616
00:27:28,826 --> 00:27:31,356
and the information just isn't

617
00:27:31,356 --> 00:27:34,026
And so it can definitely be

618
00:27:35,346 --> 00:27:37,886
So here's an alternative

619
00:27:37,886 --> 00:27:40,836
to have a graph at the top,

620
00:27:40,836 --> 00:27:41,846
And so with just a glance,

621
00:27:41,846 --> 00:27:43,886
I can actually see a lot

622
00:27:44,526 --> 00:27:47,066
And now with the use of

623
00:27:47,366 --> 00:27:50,306
and it will animate between

624
00:27:51,136 --> 00:27:53,266
And then I can also use

625
00:27:53,266 --> 00:27:55,826
through the graph to

626
00:27:56,146 --> 00:27:59,436
So even though there's a lot

627
00:27:59,436 --> 00:28:01,316
it's actually a lot

628
00:27:59,436 --> 00:28:01,316
it's actually a lot

629
00:28:01,316 --> 00:28:03,876
to the specific information

630
00:28:04,066 --> 00:28:06,886
and it makes the overall

631
00:28:07,506 --> 00:28:09,516
And so, as you can see

632
00:28:09,516 --> 00:28:11,916
and match all the technologies

633
00:28:11,916 --> 00:28:14,586
so Gestures, and the Digital

634
00:28:14,936 --> 00:28:17,136
and they create some really

635
00:28:17,606 --> 00:28:19,746
So as you're building

636
00:28:19,746 --> 00:28:20,886
you should make sure to take

637
00:28:21,066 --> 00:28:22,896
into account all

638
00:28:23,126 --> 00:28:24,256
and see how they can help

639
00:28:24,256 --> 00:28:26,216
to simplify the navigation

640
00:28:26,586 --> 00:28:31,116
A lot of focus has gone into

641
00:28:31,116 --> 00:28:32,776
and we really want to

642
00:28:32,776 --> 00:28:35,106
through to all of

643
00:28:35,106 --> 00:28:42,006
And so, last up, we're going

644
00:28:42,496 --> 00:28:45,406
that allows your users to

645
00:28:45,406 --> 00:28:46,436
as they're done interacting.

646
00:28:47,216 --> 00:28:49,516
And so a key aspect in

647
00:28:49,516 --> 00:28:53,146
on Apple Watch is that your app

648
00:28:53,486 --> 00:28:56,116
And this is especially true

649
00:28:56,116 --> 00:28:59,156
of networking or communicating

650
00:28:59,686 --> 00:29:01,386
Because often times,

651
00:28:59,686 --> 00:29:01,386
Because often times,

652
00:29:01,386 --> 00:29:03,726
to loading indicators,

653
00:29:04,446 --> 00:29:05,966
And one aspect of this is

654
00:29:05,966 --> 00:29:08,126
if you're updating the

655
00:29:08,126 --> 00:29:09,646
And that's a large enough topic

656
00:29:09,646 --> 00:29:11,016
that there's actually

657
00:29:11,016 --> 00:29:12,756
on keeping your Watch

658
00:29:13,056 --> 00:29:14,256
So make sure and check that out.

659
00:29:15,016 --> 00:29:17,196
But here, we'd like to talk

660
00:29:17,196 --> 00:29:19,066
of responding to user action.

661
00:29:19,646 --> 00:29:23,086
So, for example, you have a

662
00:29:23,086 --> 00:29:25,026
to buy some food and

663
00:29:25,346 --> 00:29:27,896
How does your app respond

664
00:29:29,316 --> 00:29:32,856
And we want to recommend that

665
00:29:32,856 --> 00:29:35,436
to your users rather than

666
00:29:35,936 --> 00:29:37,906
So we'll walk through an

667
00:29:38,506 --> 00:29:40,426
So, here, we have that

668
00:29:40,426 --> 00:29:40,986
talking about.

669
00:29:40,986 --> 00:29:43,396
I can tap on one of

670
00:29:43,396 --> 00:29:45,466
and there's a big Buy button,

671
00:29:45,466 --> 00:29:47,176
to be a really fast

672
00:29:47,726 --> 00:29:50,816
And I tap on Buy and I

673
00:29:51,036 --> 00:29:54,606
And that's because the app has

674
00:29:54,606 --> 00:29:57,536
it has to process the order, it

675
00:29:57,536 --> 00:30:01,346
And then once it's done that, it

676
00:29:57,536 --> 00:30:01,346
And then once it's done that, it

677
00:30:01,346 --> 00:30:04,696
And only then is it going to

678
00:30:04,866 --> 00:30:06,276
and say, "Hey, your

679
00:30:07,336 --> 00:30:08,686
And if we look at

680
00:30:08,686 --> 00:30:09,766
it really shows the problem.

681
00:30:10,076 --> 00:30:11,466
Right? We start with

682
00:30:11,466 --> 00:30:12,806
We tap Buy.

683
00:30:13,826 --> 00:30:15,276
And then we show the

684
00:30:15,846 --> 00:30:18,076
And during this time, the

685
00:30:18,076 --> 00:30:21,396
and stares at your app until

686
00:30:21,856 --> 00:30:24,356
And so the user is only

687
00:30:24,356 --> 00:30:25,546
at the beginning and the end,

688
00:30:25,546 --> 00:30:28,226
and so most of the time

689
00:30:28,756 --> 00:30:31,756
So we can definitely improve

690
00:30:33,036 --> 00:30:36,356
So, alternatively, if we

691
00:30:36,356 --> 00:30:40,016
and now we tap the Buy button,

692
00:30:40,556 --> 00:30:42,496
The key thing here is

693
00:30:42,496 --> 00:30:44,086
because we haven't

694
00:30:44,406 --> 00:30:46,156
We can't actually say

695
00:30:46,156 --> 00:30:47,196
because we have no idea.

696
00:30:47,536 --> 00:30:49,346
But we want to provide

697
00:30:49,346 --> 00:30:51,356
and ultimately give

698
00:30:51,696 --> 00:30:53,556
that the app is taking

699
00:30:54,036 --> 00:30:56,616
And this allows the user then

700
00:30:56,616 --> 00:30:58,786
and not have to wait

701
00:30:59,336 --> 00:31:00,796
And now, in the background,

702
00:30:59,336 --> 00:31:00,796
And now, in the background,

703
00:31:00,796 --> 00:31:05,376
the app will use a background

704
00:31:05,376 --> 00:31:08,076
with the server, and then

705
00:31:08,676 --> 00:31:10,906
And then, in the background,

706
00:31:11,336 --> 00:31:14,706
and it can use the new local

707
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:16,506
"OK, now your order

708
00:31:16,506 --> 00:31:17,246
It's on its way."

709
00:31:17,796 --> 00:31:20,516
And then you have all the same

710
00:31:21,636 --> 00:31:22,946
And looking at a

711
00:31:22,946 --> 00:31:25,976
it really shows how much it

712
00:31:26,326 --> 00:31:27,706
So we choose an item,

713
00:31:27,706 --> 00:31:28,866
and so we start out

714
00:31:30,036 --> 00:31:32,236
And then instead of showing

715
00:31:32,236 --> 00:31:33,166
we show the feedback.

716
00:31:33,946 --> 00:31:35,476
And then after we

717
00:31:35,776 --> 00:31:36,756
we show the notification.

718
00:31:37,726 --> 00:31:39,546
And so as far as the

719
00:31:39,546 --> 00:31:41,836
the overall interaction

720
00:31:41,836 --> 00:31:43,746
as it was in the first example.

721
00:31:44,506 --> 00:31:47,976
But from the user's point

722
00:31:47,976 --> 00:31:49,476
and far more responsive.

723
00:31:49,746 --> 00:31:51,886
And so it's just a better

724
00:31:51,966 --> 00:31:54,956
I do want to point out here

725
00:31:54,956 --> 00:31:57,436
that processing after the

726
00:31:57,666 --> 00:31:58,556
If you're doing networking,

727
00:31:58,556 --> 00:32:02,196
you can use a background

728
00:31:58,556 --> 00:32:02,196
you can use a background

729
00:32:02,196 --> 00:32:03,836
And make sure to

730
00:32:03,836 --> 00:32:05,566
because that will enable

731
00:32:05,566 --> 00:32:07,556
up in the background

732
00:32:07,636 --> 00:32:10,056
And then at that point, you

733
00:32:10,056 --> 00:32:11,526
that makes sense in

734
00:32:12,856 --> 00:32:16,196
Or if you have to do

735
00:32:16,196 --> 00:32:18,166
you can take out a

736
00:32:18,166 --> 00:32:19,796
We had a great walkthrough

737
00:32:19,796 --> 00:32:22,066
in a session last year called

738
00:32:22,336 --> 00:32:24,396
so make sure to check that

739
00:32:24,396 --> 00:32:26,406
of processing on

740
00:32:27,146 --> 00:32:29,906
So 2 seconds is a very

741
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:32,586
of how fast interactions

742
00:32:32,966 --> 00:32:34,776
But we really think that

743
00:32:34,776 --> 00:32:36,176
as you're building

744
00:32:36,176 --> 00:32:39,956
because it can really inform

745
00:32:40,786 --> 00:32:43,756
So as you're going about

746
00:32:43,756 --> 00:32:46,796
or thinking about your existing

747
00:32:46,796 --> 00:32:48,796
on quick interactions right

748
00:32:48,976 --> 00:32:50,876
And think about what

749
00:32:50,876 --> 00:32:52,836
that your users are

750
00:32:52,836 --> 00:32:55,566
in your applications, and make

751
00:32:55,566 --> 00:32:58,436
to the very front and are

752
00:32:59,816 --> 00:33:01,846
Use complications

753
00:32:59,816 --> 00:33:01,846
Use complications

754
00:33:01,846 --> 00:33:04,736
because they just create really

755
00:33:05,236 --> 00:33:09,306
and they just provide a lot

756
00:33:09,306 --> 00:33:10,266
for your applications.

757
00:33:12,236 --> 00:33:15,976
Use SceneKit and SpriteKit

758
00:33:16,106 --> 00:33:18,126
but also interactive

759
00:33:18,426 --> 00:33:20,456
And they can add a lot of power

760
00:33:20,456 --> 00:33:23,106
to your existing

761
00:33:23,106 --> 00:33:24,596
And so we're really excited

762
00:33:24,596 --> 00:33:26,786
to be doing with those.

763
00:33:27,166 --> 00:33:28,496
Simplify the navigation.

764
00:33:28,496 --> 00:33:31,486
Again, a lot of work

765
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:34,236
to simplify the navigation

766
00:33:34,236 --> 00:33:36,686
But we also want that to

767
00:33:36,686 --> 00:33:37,996
of our applications as well.

768
00:33:39,456 --> 00:33:41,666
And, again, never

769
00:33:41,666 --> 00:33:43,536
If you're showing a

770
00:33:43,716 --> 00:33:45,246
try and reorganize your app

771
00:33:45,336 --> 00:33:47,336
to allow the user

772
00:33:47,636 --> 00:33:49,006
Provide the instant

773
00:33:49,006 --> 00:33:50,546
and just give the

774
00:33:50,546 --> 00:33:53,426
that your app is

775
00:33:53,426 --> 00:33:55,876
And so for more information on

776
00:33:56,236 --> 00:33:57,606
go and check out the

777
00:33:57,606 --> 00:33:59,976
And there are tons

778
00:33:59,976 --> 00:34:02,496
I highly recommend the Designing

779
00:33:59,976 --> 00:34:02,496
I highly recommend the Designing

780
00:34:02,496 --> 00:34:06,156
talk this afternoon or the

781
00:34:06,156 --> 00:34:08,706
With that, I want to

782
00:34:08,706 --> 00:34:09,976
And enjoy the rest of the

783
00:34:10,507 --> 00:34:12,507
