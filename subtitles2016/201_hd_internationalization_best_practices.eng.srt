Hello.

6
00:00:41,066 --> 00:00:44,806
So hello and welcome

7
00:00:44,806 --> 00:00:46,276
Looks like it's your first

8
00:00:46,406 --> 00:00:49,236
If you didn't understand

9
00:00:49,326 --> 00:00:51,296
of the talk, you're

10
00:00:52,116 --> 00:00:56,196
So let's talk a little bit

11
00:00:56,496 --> 00:00:58,816
So as you might know,

Apple ships its products

13
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:03,576
Apple ships its products

14
00:01:03,636 --> 00:01:07,696
And two-thirds of Apple's

15
00:01:08,636 --> 00:01:11,146
Which is why it's really

16
00:01:11,146 --> 00:01:13,696
that the linguistic experience

17
00:01:14,246 --> 00:01:17,386
So we have users all over

18
00:01:17,386 --> 00:01:20,266
to Milan and Dubai and from

00:01:31,616 --> 00:01:34,466
They're also likely

23
00:01:34,466 --> 00:01:36,096
in languages you didn't expect

24
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:37,486
that aren't related

25
00:01:37,486 --> 00:01:40,466
For example, English, you

27
00:01:42,736 --> 00:01:48,246
So today I'd like to talk

28
00:01:48,416 --> 00:01:51,396
what we've been up to for

29
00:01:51,396 --> 00:01:52,426
of internationalization.

30
00:01:53,816 --> 00:01:57,016
Some fundamentals about getting

31
00:01:57,936 --> 00:02:00,866
and internationalizing your app.

32
00:01:57,936 --> 00:02:00,866
and internationalizing your app.

33
00:02:01,436 --> 00:02:05,106
Then some quick fixes that

34
00:02:05,106 --> 00:02:07,496
to make it a great app

35
00:02:08,696 --> 00:02:12,096
And lastly, some things to

36
00:02:12,606 --> 00:02:17,116
and mentality standpoint when

37
00:02:18,136 --> 00:02:19,416
So let's get started

38
00:02:21,356 --> 00:02:25,596
I'm really excited to talk

39
00:02:25,596 --> 00:02:27,706
that we've added in iOS 10.

40
00:02:28,776 --> 00:02:31,416
Now if you look around you,

41
00:02:31,746 --> 00:02:35,086
you're probably sitting

42
00:02:35,086 --> 00:02:36,476
who speaks more than

43
00:02:37,116 --> 00:02:39,946
The U.S. is an extremely

44
00:02:39,946 --> 00:02:41,666
and California especially so.

45
00:02:42,706 --> 00:02:44,766
And with iOS 10 we embraced this

46
00:02:44,766 --> 00:02:47,116
by offering you multilingual

47
00:02:47,386 --> 00:02:51,976
So you can choose from a mix

48
00:02:52,696 --> 00:02:56,416
Or any two of the languages here

49
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:58,896
on the same layout without

50
00:02:59,056 --> 00:03:01,806
and you'll get autocorrections

51
00:02:59,056 --> 00:03:01,806
and you'll get autocorrections

52
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:02,926
for both those languages.

53
00:03:06,776 --> 00:03:09,546
Another enhancement we've

54
00:03:09,546 --> 00:03:11,126
of Latin American Spanish.

55
00:03:11,716 --> 00:03:15,176
And this comes to iOS,

56
00:03:15,676 --> 00:03:16,916
And this is the first time

57
00:03:17,176 --> 00:03:21,386
that your app might

58
00:03:21,636 --> 00:03:25,596
that is not for specific

59
00:03:25,596 --> 00:03:27,546
And I'll talk about

60
00:03:27,546 --> 00:03:30,986
at the code level in a bit.

61
00:03:31,186 --> 00:03:34,316
Another great enhancement is

62
00:03:34,516 --> 00:03:36,326
that is added in foundation.

63
00:03:36,826 --> 00:03:40,266
And this will take care of

64
00:03:40,266 --> 00:03:43,366
and region aware manner

65
00:03:43,786 --> 00:03:46,126
and it already supports

66
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:51,066
like temperature, energy,

67
00:03:51,436 --> 00:03:55,906
Now, I won't be going into

68
00:03:55,906 --> 00:03:59,356
but there's a whole session

69
00:03:59,356 --> 00:04:00,946
So please check that out.

70
00:03:59,356 --> 00:04:00,946
So please check that out.

71
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:06,896
We've also localized the

72
00:04:07,276 --> 00:04:10,976
And so when you request the

73
00:04:11,076 --> 00:04:13,166
you're automatically

74
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:14,936
that supports different

75
00:04:15,336 --> 00:04:16,976
such as those used

76
00:04:17,476 --> 00:04:22,256
And when you're in this state,

77
00:04:22,256 --> 00:04:24,506
in the bottom left of the

78
00:04:24,506 --> 00:04:26,036
between these different

79
00:04:26,306 --> 00:04:30,856
Now in some cases,

80
00:04:30,856 --> 00:04:35,136
to specify ASCII capable number

81
00:04:35,366 --> 00:04:37,976
that the input that

82
00:04:37,976 --> 00:04:39,606
to be restricted

83
00:04:39,956 --> 00:04:44,086
Some examples of this are credit

84
00:04:44,116 --> 00:04:46,386
They're edge cases, but things

85
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:52,716
One of the huge new features

86
00:04:52,826 --> 00:04:57,476
in macOS Sierra is native

87
00:04:57,476 --> 00:04:59,726
for languages like

88
00:05:00,036 --> 00:05:01,646
And macOS has been redesigned

89
00:05:01,776 --> 00:05:03,226
with right-to-left

90
00:05:03,496 --> 00:05:09,316
And of course, macOS joins our

91
00:05:09,316 --> 00:05:10,926
like iOS and watchOS

92
00:05:10,926 --> 00:05:12,856
which already support

93
00:05:12,856 --> 00:05:13,666
languages natively.

94
00:05:15,126 --> 00:05:18,156
Again, this is a huge topic, and

95
00:05:18,566 --> 00:05:20,286
And again, there's

96
00:05:20,346 --> 00:05:24,346
What's New in International User

97
00:05:24,346 --> 00:05:26,946
that you should definitely

98
00:05:27,486 --> 00:05:30,636
So let's get started with

99
00:05:31,446 --> 00:05:33,666
that you need to know

100
00:05:34,176 --> 00:05:38,726
Let's take a look at an app that

101
00:05:38,906 --> 00:05:39,706
It's been re-themed,

102
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:42,496
but probably still

103
00:05:42,846 --> 00:05:45,436
So what are the various

104
00:05:45,486 --> 00:05:47,776
to internationalize here

105
00:05:47,776 --> 00:05:49,036
in different languages

106
00:05:51,126 --> 00:05:53,876
First of all, you need

107
00:05:53,876 --> 00:05:59,576
So this is basically any button

108
00:05:59,576 --> 00:06:01,646
in it, you need to make

109
00:05:59,576 --> 00:06:01,646
in it, you need to make

110
00:06:01,646 --> 00:06:03,656
into all the different languages

111
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:08,646
Then there's another

112
00:06:08,646 --> 00:06:11,956
to be localized but it

113
00:06:11,956 --> 00:06:15,806
and so you should use

114
00:06:16,096 --> 00:06:17,456
And this will save

115
00:06:18,036 --> 00:06:22,926
And lastly, you need to

116
00:06:23,186 --> 00:06:25,586
so that it will work well

117
00:06:26,736 --> 00:06:29,526
And for languages that have

118
00:06:29,526 --> 00:06:31,346
than the language

119
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:36,036
So if we do all this right,

120
00:06:36,536 --> 00:06:38,266
and we translate it

121
00:06:38,266 --> 00:06:39,626
and it looks fantastic.

122
00:06:40,346 --> 00:06:42,656
Notice how in Chinese the a.m.

123
00:06:42,656 --> 00:06:45,616
/p.m. marker goes before

124
00:06:45,616 --> 00:06:46,546
like it does in English.

125
00:06:48,006 --> 00:06:49,416
It'll also work well

126
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:51,406
for right-to-left

127
00:06:51,606 --> 00:06:52,716
Notice how the layout

128
00:06:52,716 --> 00:06:54,826
of the entire app is

129
00:06:55,756 --> 00:07:00,526
And in this case, see how

130
00:06:55,756 --> 00:07:00,526
And in this case, see how

131
00:07:00,526 --> 00:07:02,996
numbers which are different

132
00:07:03,196 --> 00:07:05,316
Again, if you use formatters,

133
00:07:06,246 --> 00:07:11,306
So those are some fundamentals

134
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:12,956
Let's take a look

135
00:07:12,956 --> 00:07:14,186
from the user side as well.

136
00:07:14,186 --> 00:07:18,216
What does a user do when they

137
00:07:18,216 --> 00:07:19,206
like an iPhone?

138
00:07:20,466 --> 00:07:22,616
Well, every Apple

139
00:07:22,616 --> 00:07:25,146
up will first ask you

140
00:07:26,326 --> 00:07:29,246
And what's going on

141
00:07:29,246 --> 00:07:32,946
that every language has a

142
00:07:32,996 --> 00:07:36,086
and of course, every region has

143
00:07:36,736 --> 00:07:40,546
So let's say a user chooses

144
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:43,946
What that becomes at the end

145
00:07:43,946 --> 00:07:49,066
of the day is a language

146
00:07:49,206 --> 00:07:50,386
What you may not know is

147
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:53,296
that language codes are

148
00:07:53,676 --> 00:07:56,916
So for example, Spanish,

149
00:07:56,916 --> 00:07:58,296
from Latin American Spanish

150
00:07:58,296 --> 00:08:00,106
which then inherits

151
00:07:58,296 --> 00:08:00,106
which then inherits

152
00:08:00,906 --> 00:08:04,186
This is really important

153
00:08:04,186 --> 00:08:07,606
to be localized into

154
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:10,666
So we want to know, okay,

155
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:11,846
that the user would prefer

156
00:08:11,846 --> 00:08:14,696
if we don't have their most

157
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:17,826
on the system.

158
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:21,856
Also, this hierarchy is not just

159
00:08:21,856 --> 00:08:23,356
like English have a hierarchy.

160
00:08:23,356 --> 00:08:27,346
For example, Indian

161
00:08:27,346 --> 00:08:30,616
that are more close

162
00:08:30,616 --> 00:08:33,916
than to American English, and

163
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:36,256
in which it inherits

164
00:08:36,966 --> 00:08:39,736
And English and Spanish are

165
00:08:39,736 --> 00:08:41,086
that have such a hierarchy.

166
00:08:41,556 --> 00:08:44,436
We also have other languages

167
00:08:44,496 --> 00:08:47,076
and Portuguese that have

168
00:08:47,316 --> 00:08:50,036
So I hope you all are taking

169
00:08:50,076 --> 00:08:52,296
on these aspects because

170
00:08:52,836 --> 00:08:55,486
The reason I'm mentioning this

171
00:08:55,486 --> 00:08:57,196
to help you solve this

172
00:08:57,196 --> 00:08:58,346
to know anything about this.

173
00:08:58,786 --> 00:09:00,116
So I'm going to show

174
00:08:58,786 --> 00:09:00,116
So I'm going to show

175
00:09:00,116 --> 00:09:02,786
that in the next

176
00:09:04,326 --> 00:09:06,596
So what's the first

177
00:09:06,596 --> 00:09:07,906
We need to localize the strings.

178
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:09,776
Now there is a little

179
00:09:10,076 --> 00:09:10,706
It's simple.

180
00:09:10,896 --> 00:09:14,856
But there's some setup

181
00:09:14,856 --> 00:09:17,106
about that in detail

182
00:09:17,706 --> 00:09:20,176
there's a lot of documentation,

183
00:09:20,176 --> 00:09:22,376
that goes into detail about

184
00:09:23,036 --> 00:09:25,976
So let's assume that you've got

185
00:09:25,976 --> 00:09:29,246
so you've got some

186
00:09:30,306 --> 00:09:32,276
If you're using storyboards

187
00:09:32,556 --> 00:09:35,006
with Base Internationalization,

188
00:09:35,586 --> 00:09:36,746
There's nothing you need to do.

189
00:09:36,746 --> 00:09:37,446
You launch your app.

190
00:09:37,506 --> 00:09:38,346
The strings get loaded.

191
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:39,506
You're golden.

192
00:09:41,856 --> 00:09:46,056
If you are creating or loading

193
00:09:46,056 --> 00:09:47,396
to call NSLocalizedString.

194
00:09:47,926 --> 00:09:51,786
NSLocalizedString will use the

195
00:09:51,786 --> 00:09:52,636
with all the fallback,

196
00:09:53,026 --> 00:09:55,146
and it will load the most

197
00:09:55,576 --> 00:09:58,156
Now, note that it's

198
00:09:58,156 --> 00:10:00,616
to your translator because

199
00:09:58,156 --> 00:10:00,616
to your translator because

200
00:10:00,616 --> 00:10:03,716
distinguished by which

201
00:10:03,716 --> 00:10:05,746
and the comment helps

202
00:10:06,366 --> 00:10:10,766
Let's move on to slightly

203
00:10:10,796 --> 00:10:13,046
Let's say you're getting

204
00:10:13,316 --> 00:10:16,156
like a server or

205
00:10:16,456 --> 00:10:19,216
Well, in that case you

206
00:10:19,216 --> 00:10:20,476
or the other process know,

207
00:10:20,476 --> 00:10:22,876
hey this is the language

208
00:10:22,946 --> 00:10:24,786
please give me strings

209
00:10:25,186 --> 00:10:28,756
And in order to do that, you

210
00:10:28,826 --> 00:10:30,616
on the Bundle that

211
00:10:30,946 --> 00:10:32,856
and get the first

212
00:10:32,856 --> 00:10:34,626
that to your remote service.

213
00:10:37,996 --> 00:10:41,726
If you have an even

214
00:10:41,726 --> 00:10:44,736
and for some reason you have

215
00:10:44,736 --> 00:10:47,596
say, on the server that

216
00:10:47,596 --> 00:10:48,906
of languages you

217
00:10:48,906 --> 00:10:51,146
Let's say you have a

218
00:10:51,436 --> 00:10:56,136
then you can call the class

219
00:10:56,436 --> 00:10:58,106
and give it the available

220
00:10:58,106 --> 00:11:00,156
And again, it will match

221
00:10:58,106 --> 00:11:00,156
And again, it will match

222
00:11:01,716 --> 00:11:06,656
So I mentioned this Bundle's

223
00:11:06,656 --> 00:11:08,246
times during the

224
00:11:08,526 --> 00:11:09,646
So what is all this about?

225
00:11:09,646 --> 00:11:11,536
And what is Bundle doing

226
00:11:12,556 --> 00:11:16,386
So what Bundle does for you is

227
00:11:16,456 --> 00:11:21,666
okay user prefers English

228
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:23,446
U.S. localization.

229
00:11:23,446 --> 00:11:24,356
We do have an English.

230
00:11:24,466 --> 00:11:26,916
So okay, in this case it

231
00:11:27,206 --> 00:11:29,666
It figures out things like

232
00:11:29,706 --> 00:11:33,566
but we have British but not

233
00:11:33,936 --> 00:11:37,206
And again, with the Spanish

234
00:11:37,506 --> 00:11:40,996
if you say I prefer Mexican

235
00:11:40,996 --> 00:11:43,326
out that oh the best

236
00:11:43,326 --> 00:11:45,846
in the list shown here is

237
00:11:46,276 --> 00:11:49,216
And similarly, for Chinese

238
00:11:49,216 --> 00:11:52,216
This is a lot of

239
00:11:52,216 --> 00:11:55,076
that you do not want to be

240
00:11:55,136 --> 00:11:57,086
And definitely if you have

241
00:11:57,086 --> 00:12:00,676
like take the language

242
00:11:57,086 --> 00:12:00,676
like take the language

243
00:12:00,676 --> 00:12:02,796
on hyphens or something like

244
00:12:02,796 --> 00:12:04,826
that code because you

245
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:10,466
So now you've localized all your

246
00:12:11,156 --> 00:12:12,046
You want to double check

247
00:12:12,046 --> 00:12:14,446
that everything you have

248
00:12:14,746 --> 00:12:18,256
To do that, you can use the

249
00:12:18,536 --> 00:12:21,576
which will actually find

250
00:12:21,616 --> 00:12:22,606
with localizability,

251
00:12:22,606 --> 00:12:25,096
where you're feeding

252
00:12:25,196 --> 00:12:25,726
into the UI.

253
00:12:25,936 --> 00:12:30,946
And that's all there is to

254
00:12:31,076 --> 00:12:32,216
Next let's talk about

255
00:12:32,966 --> 00:12:37,326
This is a common kind of

256
00:12:37,326 --> 00:12:39,406
with all the delivery services.

257
00:12:39,806 --> 00:12:43,976
And this, however, is not a good

258
00:12:44,326 --> 00:12:48,736
So it says AM9:41, which to an

259
00:12:48,736 --> 00:12:49,746
look like nonsense.

260
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:54,666
But believe me, I've

261
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:57,456
And similarly, you might see

262
00:12:57,456 --> 00:12:59,646
in Chinese where

263
00:12:59,646 --> 00:13:01,196
/p.m. marker after the numbers,

264
00:12:59,646 --> 00:13:01,196
/p.m. marker after the numbers,

265
00:13:01,196 --> 00:13:02,996
which is completely

266
00:13:03,746 --> 00:13:06,986
So how do we avoid

267
00:13:09,116 --> 00:13:13,566
The problem is actually

268
00:13:13,566 --> 00:13:17,136
which is formatter.dateFormat

269
00:13:17,656 --> 00:13:19,266
It seems like the

270
00:13:19,696 --> 00:13:21,256
It looks pretty nice in code,

271
00:13:21,646 --> 00:13:23,246
but it's actually

272
00:13:24,406 --> 00:13:27,156
And although it yields the

273
00:13:27,156 --> 00:13:30,656
out for English, so it'll give

274
00:13:30,656 --> 00:13:33,016
thing out in Chinese, and it

275
00:13:33,106 --> 00:13:36,466
Why? Because it's applying

276
00:13:36,466 --> 00:13:38,776
which language you're

277
00:13:40,076 --> 00:13:41,626
The correct approach for this is

278
00:13:41,626 --> 00:13:45,536
to just use the predefined short

279
00:13:45,596 --> 00:13:47,916
And it's going to give you

280
00:13:48,966 --> 00:13:51,696
for Chinese, and for any other

281
00:13:51,696 --> 00:13:52,286
localized in.

282
00:13:53,326 --> 00:13:55,696
And of course, there

283
00:13:55,846 --> 00:13:58,406
So we have the short style

284
00:13:58,746 --> 00:14:00,996
You can also get a

285
00:13:58,746 --> 00:14:00,996
You can also get a

286
00:14:00,996 --> 00:14:01,836
which has the seconds.

287
00:14:01,956 --> 00:14:04,176
You can have a style

288
00:14:04,636 --> 00:14:05,826
or the full time zone name.

289
00:14:05,946 --> 00:14:08,056
There are variety of different

290
00:14:08,706 --> 00:14:11,476
And of course, not

291
00:14:11,706 --> 00:14:14,246
For dates, also, we

292
00:14:14,246 --> 00:14:16,226
of styles going from

293
00:14:17,396 --> 00:14:20,276
Now you might come back to me

294
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:21,976
of those styles is

295
00:14:21,976 --> 00:14:24,796
They want, you know,

296
00:14:24,796 --> 00:14:25,936
or just this or just that."

297
00:14:26,406 --> 00:14:26,906
That's fine.

298
00:14:27,346 --> 00:14:30,106
So you can use a format.

299
00:14:30,676 --> 00:14:32,756
The important thing is to use it

300
00:14:32,886 --> 00:14:36,886
with the setLocalizedDate

301
00:14:37,146 --> 00:14:41,566
which will make sure that it

302
00:14:41,626 --> 00:14:43,356
for the current language

303
00:14:43,596 --> 00:14:46,236
and gives you the

304
00:14:46,236 --> 00:14:47,196
for that language.

305
00:14:49,756 --> 00:14:53,946
There are also two classes

306
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:57,226
They're fairly new, although not

307
00:14:57,226 --> 00:15:00,106
which will let you format, say,

308
00:14:57,226 --> 00:15:00,106
which will let you format, say,

309
00:15:00,326 --> 00:15:02,486
a duration like 4

310
00:15:03,536 --> 00:15:07,786
Or a date interval like

311
00:15:07,956 --> 00:15:11,886
9 to 9:40 a.m. So the

312
00:15:11,936 --> 00:15:14,026
is that if you use

313
00:15:14,466 --> 00:15:17,066
all the localization is going

314
00:15:17,596 --> 00:15:23,746
Next let's talk about

315
00:15:23,746 --> 00:15:25,286
that you can format, names.

316
00:15:27,616 --> 00:15:32,236
Now, if this is how you're

317
00:15:32,236 --> 00:15:36,166
or their friend's name to

318
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:38,646
they're going to get a really

319
00:15:39,076 --> 00:15:41,346
So let's not do that.

320
00:15:41,996 --> 00:15:46,336
Instead, you should show the

321
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:49,126
for that given language

322
00:15:50,466 --> 00:15:51,256
So how do we do that?

323
00:15:52,736 --> 00:15:54,526
It's actually really simple.

324
00:15:56,076 --> 00:15:58,986
You create a

325
00:15:59,116 --> 00:16:01,906
Fill it with some name

326
00:15:59,116 --> 00:16:01,906
Fill it with some name

327
00:16:01,906 --> 00:16:05,206
like any other formatter,

328
00:16:05,376 --> 00:16:08,536
from the components for any

329
00:16:08,536 --> 00:16:11,096
And again, we have a variety

330
00:16:11,446 --> 00:16:14,036
which is the full name

331
00:16:14,036 --> 00:16:15,276
which you can use for initials.

332
00:16:16,696 --> 00:16:20,056
And of course, it supports

333
00:16:20,586 --> 00:16:26,056
New this year, though,

334
00:16:26,426 --> 00:16:30,186
So now you can go from a full

335
00:16:31,196 --> 00:16:34,806
And it's as easy as creating a

336
00:16:35,256 --> 00:16:36,816
and then looking

337
00:16:37,336 --> 00:16:39,186
If it returns nil, it

338
00:16:39,186 --> 00:16:42,816
to successfully construct

339
00:16:43,756 --> 00:16:45,206
The really cool thing, though,

340
00:16:45,206 --> 00:16:48,416
is that this is not a

341
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:50,286
at some set of static rules.

342
00:16:50,516 --> 00:16:55,026
It's actually a statistical

343
00:16:55,026 --> 00:16:56,716
in the name in the

344
00:16:56,946 --> 00:17:01,666
it knows that in John Appleseed,

345
00:16:56,946 --> 00:17:01,666
it knows that in John Appleseed,

346
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:04,695
to be the given name and

347
00:17:04,695 --> 00:17:06,266
And it's still going

348
00:17:06,896 --> 00:17:11,806
And of course, it supports

349
00:17:14,175 --> 00:17:16,616
So there are a lot

350
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,536
I talked about Date

351
00:17:19,906 --> 00:17:23,786
and

352
00:17:23,786 --> 00:17:24,425
in detail.

353
00:17:25,195 --> 00:17:29,626
The components and interval

354
00:17:30,046 --> 00:17:32,646
And there are some formatters

355
00:17:32,646 --> 00:17:36,026
which are existing formatters

356
00:17:37,186 --> 00:17:41,686
And there's the brand new

357
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:43,406
in this set of releases.

358
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:47,436
So be sure to use these

359
00:17:47,436 --> 00:17:49,576
in your code because they

360
00:17:49,576 --> 00:17:51,756
and you will also save

361
00:17:53,136 --> 00:17:54,726
Which you shouldn't be

362
00:17:56,216 --> 00:18:02,396
So that's all about at this

363
00:17:56,216 --> 00:18:02,396
So that's all about at this

364
00:18:02,396 --> 00:18:03,116
in terms of strings.

365
00:18:03,316 --> 00:18:05,646
Now let's take a look at

366
00:18:05,646 --> 00:18:07,316
of the layout to make sure

367
00:18:07,316 --> 00:18:10,256
that the UI actually works

368
00:18:12,086 --> 00:18:16,256
So the key word here

369
00:18:16,616 --> 00:18:20,876
It does what it's intended --

370
00:18:20,876 --> 00:18:22,646
which is it automatically

371
00:18:23,246 --> 00:18:25,436
And so whether you're

372
00:18:26,746 --> 00:18:30,706
if you use Auto Layout you

373
00:18:30,706 --> 00:18:33,026
interface for a right-to-left

374
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:38,276
And again, Auto Layout is a big

375
00:18:38,276 --> 00:18:41,386
into detail into how you

376
00:18:41,386 --> 00:18:44,246
because there are sessions

377
00:18:44,246 --> 00:18:48,326
and from previous years that go

378
00:18:49,756 --> 00:18:53,166
What I will tell you is that

379
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:58,706
and NSStackView as much as you

380
00:18:58,706 --> 00:19:01,466
to use APIs that leverage

381
00:18:58,706 --> 00:19:01,466
to use APIs that leverage

382
00:19:01,786 --> 00:19:05,616
that your views will

383
00:19:05,616 --> 00:19:07,996
for right-to-left languages

384
00:19:07,996 --> 00:19:09,966
when they get long

385
00:19:11,056 --> 00:19:14,546
So we will have sample code

386
00:19:14,546 --> 00:19:21,196
to implement a version of the

387
00:19:23,046 --> 00:19:25,726
Now one thing that you

388
00:19:25,726 --> 00:19:29,096
for layout is that sometimes

389
00:19:29,696 --> 00:19:31,446
Now you see this

390
00:19:31,656 --> 00:19:33,526
Are you sure you don't

391
00:19:34,226 --> 00:19:37,846
And you have two options there,

392
00:19:37,846 --> 00:19:40,976
Now in some languages you can

393
00:19:41,016 --> 00:19:43,616
be longer than can fit in

394
00:19:44,626 --> 00:19:45,756
So what do you do?

395
00:19:46,146 --> 00:19:50,146
Well, in this case, you see

396
00:19:50,146 --> 00:19:52,236
to a top-bottom orientation

397
00:19:52,236 --> 00:19:53,586
of a left-right orientation.

398
00:19:54,196 --> 00:19:58,106
And these kind of creative

399
00:19:58,106 --> 00:20:02,596
that you should keep in mind for

400
00:19:58,106 --> 00:20:02,596
that you should keep in mind for

401
00:20:03,066 --> 00:20:07,726
you ask a translator to

402
00:20:07,726 --> 00:20:10,396
where it might not even be

403
00:20:14,176 --> 00:20:16,286
The next thing is

404
00:20:16,286 --> 00:20:21,076
And a lot of you may not

405
00:20:21,076 --> 00:20:21,906
for your apps.

406
00:20:22,936 --> 00:20:28,136
So we have a lot of scripts

407
00:20:28,136 --> 00:20:32,776
like Vietnamese, Thai, Arabic,

408
00:20:32,876 --> 00:20:37,026
or lower or both than the basic

409
00:20:37,076 --> 00:20:37,936
to write English.

410
00:20:39,336 --> 00:20:43,196
And so what happens

411
00:20:43,526 --> 00:20:46,366
which is that somebody

412
00:20:46,366 --> 00:20:48,246
to true on the label.

413
00:20:48,746 --> 00:20:52,126
And what that does is it clips

414
00:20:52,786 --> 00:20:59,156
and besides being very ugly and,

415
00:20:59,156 --> 00:21:04,336
in that language, you often lose

416
00:20:59,156 --> 00:21:04,336
in that language, you often lose

417
00:21:04,336 --> 00:21:05,756
like a diacritic mark.

418
00:21:06,376 --> 00:21:09,726
In this case the pronunciation

419
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:13,386
on the right is changing

420
00:21:14,566 --> 00:21:16,716
So to fix this it's

421
00:21:16,716 --> 00:21:20,106
Don't set clipsToBounds to

422
00:21:20,716 --> 00:21:23,316
And that should be enough

423
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:29,706
More interestingly, though,

424
00:21:29,836 --> 00:21:32,846
you also need to consider

425
00:21:33,686 --> 00:21:36,856
So let's take a look here

426
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:38,736
and English on the right.

427
00:21:39,896 --> 00:21:41,846
And here it's English

428
00:21:41,846 --> 00:21:43,246
on the right, sorry about that.

429
00:21:43,906 --> 00:21:48,756
But see what happens when

430
00:21:48,756 --> 00:21:51,796
into the same amount of

431
00:21:52,506 --> 00:21:55,126
It looks really cramped.

432
00:21:55,126 --> 00:22:00,546
And any Hindi reader will tell

433
00:21:55,126 --> 00:22:00,546
And any Hindi reader will tell

434
00:22:01,056 --> 00:22:02,536
and it doesn't look nice.

435
00:22:04,026 --> 00:22:05,816
So what you really need to do is

436
00:22:05,846 --> 00:22:08,866
to give each script the

437
00:22:08,866 --> 00:22:12,096
and to look good on screen

438
00:22:12,376 --> 00:22:14,656
The good news is that

439
00:22:15,946 --> 00:22:18,556
Any time you have a

440
00:22:18,696 --> 00:22:21,186
a lot of this is done by default

441
00:22:21,186 --> 00:22:23,416
when you set a custom font

442
00:22:23,856 --> 00:22:27,256
that you get a preferred

443
00:22:28,626 --> 00:22:32,936
Now, you might say, okay

444
00:22:32,936 --> 00:22:34,636
and I can't use this.

445
00:22:34,926 --> 00:22:39,056
Well, there is a solution

446
00:22:39,476 --> 00:22:43,446
out the fonts and typography

447
00:22:43,446 --> 00:22:45,776
into more detail about

448
00:22:45,776 --> 00:22:52,966
that a custom font will

449
00:22:54,156 --> 00:22:58,966
Next, for table views, we

450
00:22:58,966 --> 00:23:01,716
which is that if you have a

451
00:22:58,966 --> 00:23:01,716
which is that if you have a

452
00:23:02,076 --> 00:23:07,536
we will actually make the table

453
00:23:07,586 --> 00:23:09,136
in other languages like English.

454
00:23:09,776 --> 00:23:12,596
Again, this gives the script

455
00:23:12,596 --> 00:23:15,936
and it just overall looks more

456
00:23:17,196 --> 00:23:20,226
The way you can take

457
00:23:20,226 --> 00:23:23,556
by using the standard

458
00:23:24,086 --> 00:23:26,976
And now you might say, okay,

459
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:28,706
you know, it's not

460
00:23:28,706 --> 00:23:30,776
I mean, I don't just have

461
00:23:30,776 --> 00:23:32,086
it's not as simple

462
00:23:32,086 --> 00:23:33,126
And I'll be like, okay sure.

463
00:23:33,696 --> 00:23:37,466
I agree. But what

464
00:23:37,466 --> 00:23:42,546
in using UITableViewCell is

465
00:23:42,856 --> 00:23:45,066
It has a bunch of

466
00:23:45,196 --> 00:23:47,436
usually to get exactly

467
00:23:47,686 --> 00:23:51,406
So try that first before you're

468
00:23:51,976 --> 00:23:53,346
custom UITableViewCell.

469
00:23:56,876 --> 00:24:01,326
So that's mostly what I have

470
00:23:56,876 --> 00:24:01,326
So that's mostly what I have

471
00:24:01,326 --> 00:24:04,516
that will make your app great

472
00:24:05,046 --> 00:24:07,676
Let's talk about some things

473
00:24:07,676 --> 00:24:09,166
that are more design based.

474
00:24:10,256 --> 00:24:12,826
And also the mentality

475
00:24:13,396 --> 00:24:15,406
for making great apps.

476
00:24:16,736 --> 00:24:18,856
First of all, it's

477
00:24:19,716 --> 00:24:23,296
Now you know that when you go to

478
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:25,166
for an app one of the

479
00:24:25,166 --> 00:24:26,456
to notice is that icon.

480
00:24:27,006 --> 00:24:29,036
And oftentimes, at

481
00:24:29,036 --> 00:24:31,086
if the icon doesn't look

482
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:32,596
because that's going to

483
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:35,736
And I don't want to have an app

484
00:24:36,446 --> 00:24:39,546
So icons are really important,

485
00:24:39,546 --> 00:24:42,816
that the icon that

486
00:24:43,186 --> 00:24:45,676
for different languages

487
00:24:45,676 --> 00:24:48,586
in different layout directions

488
00:24:48,586 --> 00:24:49,976
like left-to-right

489
00:24:50,576 --> 00:24:53,346
So photos has a great icon here.

490
00:24:53,346 --> 00:24:58,036
This is a great example of an

491
00:24:58,036 --> 00:25:02,056
or numbers that would tie

492
00:24:58,036 --> 00:25:02,056
or numbers that would tie

493
00:25:02,646 --> 00:25:04,406
It also doesn't have

494
00:25:04,406 --> 00:25:05,916
like left-to-right

495
00:25:06,286 --> 00:25:08,966
So it really works well,

496
00:25:08,966 --> 00:25:10,426
in English, and in Arabic.

497
00:25:11,166 --> 00:25:15,886
Now if you are making a

498
00:25:16,326 --> 00:25:19,566
and you want to make sure

499
00:25:19,566 --> 00:25:20,706
for right-to-left languages.

500
00:25:21,676 --> 00:25:23,856
You should take a look at some

501
00:25:24,186 --> 00:25:27,146
And if you are using artwork

502
00:25:27,326 --> 00:25:29,686
that would need to change

503
00:25:30,046 --> 00:25:33,916
then you would probably need to

504
00:25:33,916 --> 00:25:35,106
for right-to-left languages.

505
00:25:35,466 --> 00:25:38,116
Now here you see an

506
00:25:38,116 --> 00:25:39,976
that you can't just

507
00:25:39,976 --> 00:25:42,306
You need to create

508
00:25:42,436 --> 00:25:43,656
in a right-to-left language.

509
00:25:44,976 --> 00:25:47,776
But if you do have images

510
00:25:47,846 --> 00:25:49,796
there is actually API for

511
00:25:49,796 --> 00:25:50,886
to create separate artwork.

512
00:25:51,826 --> 00:25:54,376
There's more information about

513
00:25:54,376 --> 00:25:57,246
in International

514
00:25:58,466 --> 00:26:03,056
But the key is asset catalogues.

515
00:25:58,466 --> 00:26:03,056
But the key is asset catalogues.

516
00:26:03,876 --> 00:26:06,866
Another thing that you might

517
00:26:06,866 --> 00:26:08,476
about is your app's name.

518
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:12,896
Now, when looking at various

519
00:26:13,166 --> 00:26:16,036
one consistent theme we've

520
00:26:16,036 --> 00:26:19,506
in the least is that users

521
00:26:19,846 --> 00:26:21,656
that work for them

522
00:26:21,936 --> 00:26:24,356
And that applies to

523
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:27,986
Because if they can -- if they

524
00:26:27,986 --> 00:26:31,516
app does by looking at the

525
00:26:31,826 --> 00:26:33,776
then they're much more likely

526
00:26:34,046 --> 00:26:40,426
to tap inside the

527
00:26:40,426 --> 00:26:42,966
And of course, the world is --

528
00:26:43,516 --> 00:26:47,046
users all over the world are

529
00:26:47,246 --> 00:26:48,866
or at least they're bilingual.

530
00:26:49,426 --> 00:26:52,926
So your app should

531
00:26:53,016 --> 00:26:58,586
about the UI language and

532
00:26:58,786 --> 00:26:59,776
that the user will type.

533
00:27:00,256 --> 00:27:04,766
For example, a very common theme

534
00:27:04,806 --> 00:27:08,196
in Asia like India

535
00:27:08,196 --> 00:27:10,906
that people will run

536
00:27:11,326 --> 00:27:14,556
but they'll have content

537
00:27:14,556 --> 00:27:15,786
like Hindi in this case.

538
00:27:16,806 --> 00:27:20,996
So when you have an app and you

539
00:27:20,996 --> 00:27:22,706
that the user's going

540
00:27:22,786 --> 00:27:25,896
especially make sure to

541
00:27:25,896 --> 00:27:27,416
and Japanese keyboards

542
00:27:27,416 --> 00:27:29,036
that the experience works well.

543
00:27:32,916 --> 00:27:37,266
And here's an example that I

544
00:27:37,726 --> 00:27:40,886
that in our opinion

545
00:27:40,886 --> 00:27:42,186
at the things I just

546
00:27:43,616 --> 00:27:44,516
So this is Evernote.

547
00:27:45,286 --> 00:27:47,826
And first of all,

548
00:27:48,546 --> 00:27:50,466
It doesn't have any words

549
00:27:50,466 --> 00:27:53,446
that would associate it

550
00:27:54,596 --> 00:27:55,826
So that's great.

551
00:27:58,036 --> 00:27:59,976
However, they have also gone

552
00:28:00,176 --> 00:28:03,496
and localized their

553
00:28:03,546 --> 00:28:05,536
And this is actually if

554
00:28:05,536 --> 00:28:10,006
you'll see that they have

555
00:28:10,106 --> 00:28:12,066
because the Chinese word

556
00:28:12,066 --> 00:28:15,336
that they've chosen also

557
00:28:15,336 --> 00:28:20,616
for elephant, which is their

558
00:28:20,836 --> 00:28:23,336
You'll also notice that they

559
00:28:24,246 --> 00:28:29,366
And there's a lot of attention

560
00:28:29,366 --> 00:28:32,016
You'll see, for example, that

561
00:28:32,276 --> 00:28:34,726
in which they're

562
00:28:35,516 --> 00:28:37,586
you actually have the

563
00:28:37,586 --> 00:28:39,116
So the user is seeing

564
00:28:39,586 --> 00:28:42,336
in the screenshots exactly the

565
00:28:42,336 --> 00:28:43,756
to get when they

566
00:28:43,996 --> 00:28:45,806
This is exactly what

567
00:28:46,206 --> 00:28:47,416
So take advantage of the fact

568
00:28:47,416 --> 00:28:50,506
that you can upload

569
00:28:50,506 --> 00:28:54,516
and screenshots to

570
00:28:55,026 --> 00:28:59,156
And lastly, I wanted to talk

571
00:28:59,296 --> 00:29:03,166
What you can do to go above and

572
00:28:59,296 --> 00:29:03,166
What you can do to go above and

573
00:29:03,166 --> 00:29:07,396
for people in the --

574
00:29:07,396 --> 00:29:08,446
or in a specific country.

575
00:29:09,856 --> 00:29:10,946
I'll give a couple of examples.

576
00:29:11,376 --> 00:29:15,786
One is if you have any

577
00:29:15,786 --> 00:29:18,966
such as templates and pages.

578
00:29:20,196 --> 00:29:24,576
You could create

579
00:29:24,576 --> 00:29:25,616
for different languages.

580
00:29:26,076 --> 00:29:30,316
And so for example, in Pages

581
00:29:30,316 --> 00:29:32,026
for cards for some languages.

582
00:29:33,966 --> 00:29:37,456
And just one more

583
00:29:37,496 --> 00:29:40,746
for more advanced feature,

584
00:29:41,146 --> 00:29:44,266
you're a calendar app, and you

585
00:29:44,366 --> 00:29:48,456
for the Middle East and also

586
00:29:48,716 --> 00:29:51,806
like China where they

587
00:29:51,986 --> 00:29:54,146
Well, you could support

588
00:29:54,196 --> 00:29:58,236
in your calendar app just like

589
00:29:59,006 --> 00:30:02,856
because this is going to

590
00:29:59,006 --> 00:30:02,856
because this is going to

591
00:30:03,006 --> 00:30:04,006
for those users.

592
00:30:05,156 --> 00:30:07,186
Now what your app

593
00:30:07,186 --> 00:30:09,236
depends on what your app does.

594
00:30:09,706 --> 00:30:12,276
And so you need to take a

595
00:30:12,276 --> 00:30:16,476
if there's an area where you can

596
00:30:17,676 --> 00:30:21,086
That's really all I

597
00:30:21,196 --> 00:30:27,326
So in summary, localize

598
00:30:27,916 --> 00:30:31,346
Use standard system APIs

599
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:37,596
Make sure that the apps' layout

600
00:30:37,596 --> 00:30:39,366
for languages with

601
00:30:39,706 --> 00:30:44,086
longer translations, which have

602
00:30:44,126 --> 00:30:47,336
English-sized scripts

603
00:30:50,576 --> 00:30:53,676
When designing the

604
00:30:54,416 --> 00:30:56,826
make sure that it is

605
00:30:56,826 --> 00:31:03,446
and doesn't tailor to a

606
00:30:56,826 --> 00:31:03,446
and doesn't tailor to a

607
00:31:04,206 --> 00:31:08,406
And finally, at the end

608
00:31:08,406 --> 00:31:10,436
if appropriate, and screenshots.

609
00:31:11,676 --> 00:31:16,276
Now for more information,

610
00:31:16,596 --> 00:31:18,626
to get some other useful links

611
00:31:19,156 --> 00:31:21,246
about internationalization

612
00:31:21,776 --> 00:31:25,906
There are also some

613
00:31:25,906 --> 00:31:30,816
that I mentioned

614
00:31:31,066 --> 00:31:32,306
So for example, there's

615
00:31:32,306 --> 00:31:33,836
in International

616
00:31:34,296 --> 00:31:37,086
And there's also a

617
00:31:37,716 --> 00:31:41,256
One talk that I wanted to call

618
00:31:41,256 --> 00:31:43,896
out specifically is

619
00:31:44,026 --> 00:31:47,776
It kind of will talk more about

620
00:31:47,776 --> 00:31:53,226
at the end about how you can

621
00:31:53,566 --> 00:31:56,196
for both internationalization

622
00:31:56,476 --> 00:31:59,266
that need accessibility support.

623
00:32:00,306 --> 00:32:00,786
And that's all.

624
00:32:01,506 --> 00:32:02,206
Thank you very much.

625
00:32:03,516 --> 00:32:06,500
