00:00:29,046 --> 00:00:31,426
&gt;&gt; Hello, everyone.

4
00:00:32,206 --> 00:00:33,026
Thank you for coming.

5
00:00:33,326 --> 00:00:37,456
Welcome. My name is Dennis

6
00:00:37,456 --> 00:00:39,746
of the HomeKit engineering

7
00:00:41,576 --> 00:00:44,686
So before we get started

8
00:00:45,416 --> 00:00:49,666
we'll spend the first couple of

9
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:51,816
and I want to highlight

10
00:00:51,816 --> 00:00:52,796
of what makes HomeKit.

11
00:00:55,436 --> 00:00:59,396
HomeKit is a framework which

12
00:00:59,746 --> 00:01:03,966
that allow your applications

13
00:00:59,746 --> 00:01:03,966
that allow your applications

14
00:01:03,966 --> 00:01:05,816
of HomeKit enabled accessories.

15
00:01:06,626 --> 00:01:10,506
Your applications can use

16
00:01:10,506 --> 00:01:14,036
with accessories from

17
00:01:17,256 --> 00:01:23,876
HomeKit maintains the user's

18
00:01:24,366 --> 00:01:27,286
Now this is great

19
00:01:27,286 --> 00:01:32,466
in the system have access

20
00:01:32,646 --> 00:01:35,656
and configuration

21
00:01:37,906 --> 00:01:41,556
And if the user has multiple

22
00:01:41,556 --> 00:01:44,386
in to the same iCloud

23
00:01:44,386 --> 00:01:49,406
of synchronizing this home data

24
00:01:49,406 --> 00:01:50,376
that the user may have.

25
00:01:50,746 --> 00:01:54,056
Now this is great because

26
00:01:54,056 --> 00:01:56,806
up on the user's part, the

27
00:01:56,806 --> 00:01:59,646
of their devices and

28
00:01:59,646 --> 00:02:01,426
with the HomeKit accessories.

29
00:01:59,646 --> 00:02:01,426
with the HomeKit accessories.

30
00:02:04,476 --> 00:02:08,746
HomeKit also supports for

31
00:02:09,476 --> 00:02:13,546
So a user can share their

32
00:02:13,546 --> 00:02:16,676
and friends also to

33
00:02:16,676 --> 00:02:18,696
that the user has

34
00:02:19,456 --> 00:02:21,176
Sharing is very simple.

35
00:02:21,336 --> 00:02:26,006
All that a user has to do is

36
00:02:26,006 --> 00:02:30,816
their iCloud account, and once

37
00:02:30,976 --> 00:02:35,086
HomeKit automatically takes

38
00:02:35,086 --> 00:02:37,366
across to additional

39
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:40,046
as configuring all the

40
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:43,206
so that now the shared

41
00:02:43,486 --> 00:02:45,236
and control these accessories.

42
00:02:46,286 --> 00:02:50,666
The owner, of course, can

43
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:55,066
at any point in time.

44
00:02:55,246 --> 00:03:00,416
HomeKit supports a common

45
00:02:55,246 --> 00:03:00,416
HomeKit supports a common

46
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:04,206
to securely communicate

47
00:03:05,576 --> 00:03:08,606
So all HomeKit accessories,

48
00:03:08,606 --> 00:03:10,856
of their underlying

49
00:03:11,226 --> 00:03:13,626
use the same common protocol.

50
00:03:14,476 --> 00:03:19,166
Now all this protocol Apple

51
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:23,476
of profiles which describe

52
00:03:23,976 --> 00:03:27,436
Now with this profiles,

53
00:03:28,396 --> 00:03:32,356
This is great and it provides

54
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:36,156
to communicate and control their

55
00:03:40,636 --> 00:03:43,616
When the user is at

56
00:03:43,616 --> 00:03:45,076
between their Apple device

57
00:03:45,076 --> 00:03:47,856
and their HomeKit enabled

58
00:03:48,646 --> 00:03:51,976
So all that a user need is their

59
00:03:52,236 --> 00:03:56,006
and their Apple device to

60
00:03:56,496 --> 00:03:58,716
This communication

61
00:03:59,096 --> 00:04:00,486
or Bluetooth low energy.

62
00:03:59,096 --> 00:04:00,486
or Bluetooth low energy.

63
00:04:01,006 --> 00:04:07,916
When the user is away from

64
00:04:08,086 --> 00:04:12,366
to their accessories at home

65
00:04:12,576 --> 00:04:15,036
which acts as a remote

66
00:04:15,816 --> 00:04:18,796
And Apple TV then securely

67
00:04:18,796 --> 00:04:19,935
between the user's device

68
00:04:20,185 --> 00:04:25,266
and their accessories,

69
00:04:25,476 --> 00:04:30,156
Security. We have built

70
00:04:30,156 --> 00:04:32,176
in mind right from day one.

71
00:04:33,496 --> 00:04:37,126
All HomeKit communications

72
00:04:37,896 --> 00:04:40,076
What this means is

73
00:04:40,076 --> 00:04:43,226
to secure this communication

74
00:04:43,226 --> 00:04:44,516
on the user's devices.

75
00:04:46,026 --> 00:04:48,246
So even if the communication

76
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:50,356
through intermediate

77
00:04:50,716 --> 00:04:52,206
they cannot be decrypted.

78
00:04:52,716 --> 00:04:53,976
Not even by Apple.

79
00:04:59,816 --> 00:05:02,286
HomeKit provides for

80
00:04:59,816 --> 00:05:02,286
HomeKit provides for

81
00:05:02,286 --> 00:05:04,126
as perfect forward secrecy.

82
00:05:04,996 --> 00:05:07,816
What this means is every

83
00:05:07,936 --> 00:05:09,726
between an Apple user's device

84
00:05:10,186 --> 00:05:12,326
and their HomeKit

85
00:05:12,786 --> 00:05:15,976
user's new session keys

86
00:05:15,976 --> 00:05:18,466
for that session, and after

87
00:05:18,746 --> 00:05:20,046
these keys are then discarded.

88
00:05:20,826 --> 00:05:25,486
Now this is great because

89
00:05:25,486 --> 00:05:28,696
of the device is compromised and

90
00:05:29,136 --> 00:05:33,276
that then cannot be used to

91
00:05:33,516 --> 00:05:38,326
that would have happened

92
00:05:38,466 --> 00:05:40,336
Home data is private.

93
00:05:41,076 --> 00:05:44,266
We take care of privacy

94
00:05:44,266 --> 00:05:48,536
as applications have to

95
00:05:48,956 --> 00:05:53,216
to get access to

96
00:05:53,376 --> 00:05:55,676
HomeKit supports a

97
00:05:56,326 --> 00:05:59,486
Working with our accessory

98
00:05:59,486 --> 00:06:01,046
of accessories in

99
00:05:59,486 --> 00:06:01,046
of accessories in

100
00:06:01,516 --> 00:06:04,086
and many of our partners

101
00:06:04,086 --> 00:06:05,806
and exciting classes

102
00:06:06,126 --> 00:06:07,676
to the HomeKit ecosystem.

103
00:06:10,556 --> 00:06:14,196
So that was a very

104
00:06:14,456 --> 00:06:17,206
With that background,

105
00:06:17,566 --> 00:06:22,146
with what's new in HomeKit.

106
00:06:22,236 --> 00:06:25,216
So we're going to cover

107
00:06:26,576 --> 00:06:27,966
First, platform.

108
00:06:29,326 --> 00:06:31,686
We are expanding

109
00:06:32,116 --> 00:06:36,766
through Apple's platform

110
00:06:37,636 --> 00:06:43,226
We are introducing support

111
00:06:43,226 --> 00:06:45,096
of accessories in this release.

112
00:06:45,646 --> 00:06:51,496
And all this new

113
00:06:51,496 --> 00:06:54,246
as several enhancements

114
00:06:54,586 --> 00:06:57,736
to your applications via

115
00:06:57,976 --> 00:07:02,826
and we will cover

116
00:06:57,976 --> 00:07:02,826
and we will cover

117
00:07:02,996 --> 00:07:07,226
First, on platform,

118
00:07:07,696 --> 00:07:11,146
to deliver an Apple app

119
00:07:12,436 --> 00:07:18,386
The home app provides a very

120
00:07:18,386 --> 00:07:20,416
to control their

121
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:22,816
as configure their

122
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:26,586
It also enables users

123
00:07:26,586 --> 00:07:27,646
that they have in their home.

124
00:07:29,996 --> 00:07:34,956
Home app is supported on all

125
00:07:35,046 --> 00:07:41,346
looks beautiful on an iPad,

126
00:07:41,926 --> 00:07:44,836
home app is also supported

127
00:07:47,716 --> 00:07:50,456
We think this is going to be a

128
00:07:53,066 --> 00:07:57,546
Not only that, we are also

129
00:07:57,726 --> 00:07:58,626
into the system.

130
00:07:59,206 --> 00:08:03,346
Now HomeKit is also available

131
00:07:59,206 --> 00:08:03,346
Now HomeKit is also available

132
00:08:04,486 --> 00:08:07,486
So the user can configure

133
00:08:07,596 --> 00:08:11,736
and can have control of the

134
00:08:11,846 --> 00:08:13,956
to [inaudible] directly

135
00:08:17,376 --> 00:08:22,316
Second on platform is remote

136
00:08:23,566 --> 00:08:28,196
With tvOS 10, we are extending

137
00:08:28,196 --> 00:08:31,336
on the Apple TV so that in

138
00:08:31,646 --> 00:08:35,336
now the Apple TV runs

139
00:08:35,546 --> 00:08:37,446
that the user has set

140
00:08:38,515 --> 00:08:44,976
[ Applause ]

141
00:08:45,476 --> 00:08:49,946
Yeah, that's great because now

142
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:53,276
the virtual part of the world,

143
00:08:53,686 --> 00:08:55,756
that all the automations now run

144
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:58,386
from their Apple

145
00:09:00,816 --> 00:09:03,006
Apple TV also enables

146
00:09:03,006 --> 00:09:06,406
for additional controls

147
00:09:07,136 --> 00:09:09,336
Now it is also possible now

148
00:09:09,336 --> 00:09:12,716
to grant administrative

149
00:09:13,466 --> 00:09:16,736
So a shared user with an

150
00:09:16,736 --> 00:09:17,876
configurations in the home.

151
00:09:18,476 --> 00:09:20,856
So they can add or remove

152
00:09:21,356 --> 00:09:24,656
or they, in turn, can also

153
00:09:25,006 --> 00:09:27,016
to the home and give

154
00:09:27,016 --> 00:09:31,176
of the accessories at home.

155
00:09:31,386 --> 00:09:34,956
Now it is also possible to

156
00:09:35,306 --> 00:09:39,606
So it is possible to grant or

157
00:09:39,906 --> 00:09:42,696
to your accessories at home

158
00:09:47,616 --> 00:09:48,936
It's the same set

159
00:09:48,936 --> 00:09:55,296
of functionality is now

160
00:09:55,446 --> 00:10:00,326
Not only that, if

161
00:09:55,446 --> 00:10:00,326
Not only that, if

162
00:10:00,326 --> 00:10:02,806
of these remote access

163
00:10:02,806 --> 00:10:06,956
in their home, like in this

164
00:10:07,266 --> 00:10:09,376
or any combination

165
00:10:09,946 --> 00:10:12,336
they will automatically

166
00:10:12,506 --> 00:10:14,976
and extend the HomeKit

167
00:10:15,606 --> 00:10:17,296
And to communicate

168
00:10:17,596 --> 00:10:20,446
they will automatically select

169
00:10:20,926 --> 00:10:23,206
No additional configuration

170
00:10:23,496 --> 00:10:26,506
This is all just

171
00:10:28,276 --> 00:10:32,516
Third update on platform

172
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:38,856
We are thrilled to bring the

173
00:10:39,476 --> 00:10:43,206
[ Applause ]

174
00:10:43,706 --> 00:10:45,206
Now with the HomeKit

175
00:10:45,206 --> 00:10:49,566
your applications can

176
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:53,316
control the accessories

177
00:10:53,316 --> 00:10:58,926
as execute scenes

178
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:03,206
This also means that

179
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:03,206
This also means that

180
00:11:03,206 --> 00:11:04,976
for HomeKit on the Apple TV.

181
00:11:06,676 --> 00:11:09,876
[ Applause ]

182
00:11:10,376 --> 00:11:13,416
So directly from your

183
00:11:13,766 --> 00:11:18,996
you can control your

184
00:11:19,196 --> 00:11:23,016
So those were the major

185
00:11:24,316 --> 00:11:25,436
Let's just quickly recap.

186
00:11:26,286 --> 00:11:28,626
First, home app.

187
00:11:28,876 --> 00:11:32,986
An Apple-designed app for

188
00:11:32,986 --> 00:11:36,176
up of accessories as well as

189
00:11:36,176 --> 00:11:40,526
of the accessories very easy.

190
00:11:40,786 --> 00:11:42,906
Second, remote access

191
00:11:43,026 --> 00:11:45,636
We're extending the capabilities

192
00:11:45,636 --> 00:11:47,096
so that it now runs automation,

193
00:11:47,346 --> 00:11:51,186
and it also enables additional

194
00:11:53,256 --> 00:11:58,936
And the same capability is

195
00:11:59,026 --> 00:12:02,676
And, third, on tvOS, we're

196
00:11:59,026 --> 00:12:02,676
And, third, on tvOS, we're

197
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:04,826
So we are really thrilled

198
00:12:04,826 --> 00:12:10,936
to bring these capabilities

199
00:12:11,016 --> 00:12:15,206
The second area we will

200
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:22,796
First on new accessories, we

201
00:12:22,796 --> 00:12:25,646
of air treatment accessories

202
00:12:26,706 --> 00:12:30,676
So now HomeKit can support

203
00:12:31,826 --> 00:12:35,726
air purifiers as

204
00:12:36,696 --> 00:12:41,086
This is great because our users

205
00:12:41,146 --> 00:12:45,276
which are also HomeKit enabled

206
00:12:45,276 --> 00:12:46,826
in their home and add it

207
00:12:46,826 --> 00:12:52,566
to their automations

208
00:12:52,756 --> 00:12:58,426
Next, we are really thrilled to

209
00:12:58,526 --> 00:13:01,116
of camera accessories

210
00:12:58,526 --> 00:13:01,116
of camera accessories

211
00:13:02,516 --> 00:13:07,886
[ Applause ]

212
00:13:08,386 --> 00:13:09,866
Now with camera accessories,

213
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:14,016
your applications can

214
00:13:14,016 --> 00:13:14,896
from the camera.

215
00:13:15,746 --> 00:13:18,206
Display take and display

216
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:23,026
Control all the settings

217
00:13:23,026 --> 00:13:26,116
as control the speaker

218
00:13:29,956 --> 00:13:31,936
Third, doorbells.

219
00:13:32,956 --> 00:13:35,426
Now doorbell is a

220
00:13:36,296 --> 00:13:41,076
It generates and events once

221
00:13:41,286 --> 00:13:42,786
Also the doorbell has control

222
00:13:42,786 --> 00:13:46,176
where it can control the volume

223
00:13:46,816 --> 00:13:49,566
and also if the doorbell has

224
00:13:49,906 --> 00:13:53,626
those can also be controlled

225
00:13:54,856 --> 00:13:58,216
Now doorbells we are

226
00:13:58,216 --> 00:14:00,176
with other kinds of accessories.

227
00:13:58,216 --> 00:14:00,176
with other kinds of accessories.

228
00:14:01,046 --> 00:14:03,366
So doorbell camera

229
00:14:04,106 --> 00:14:07,286
Now this configuration is

230
00:14:07,886 --> 00:14:14,426
Not only are these powerful

231
00:14:14,426 --> 00:14:19,266
by HomeKit, we are also tightly

232
00:14:19,536 --> 00:14:20,436
into the system.

233
00:14:22,476 --> 00:14:29,166
So now, for example, if you

234
00:14:29,756 --> 00:14:34,826
and a camera which are

235
00:14:34,826 --> 00:14:38,396
to be part of a room, maybe

236
00:14:38,396 --> 00:14:43,536
entryway, HomeKit will

237
00:14:43,846 --> 00:14:45,946
from these different

238
00:14:46,756 --> 00:14:50,326
and they can provide

239
00:14:50,686 --> 00:14:51,306
to the user.

240
00:14:52,596 --> 00:14:55,616
This enables for some

241
00:14:55,616 --> 00:14:57,576
like rich notifications.

242
00:14:58,226 --> 00:15:03,456
So, for example, now here,

243
00:14:58,226 --> 00:15:03,456
So, for example, now here,

244
00:15:03,976 --> 00:15:07,386
HomeKit will automatically take

245
00:15:07,876 --> 00:15:11,236
and the user is presented

246
00:15:13,426 --> 00:15:17,556
Also, there are controls

247
00:15:17,786 --> 00:15:20,736
where the user can press,

248
00:15:20,736 --> 00:15:23,806
and start an audio session

249
00:15:23,806 --> 00:15:25,616
so chooses, unlock the door,

250
00:15:26,396 --> 00:15:29,956
and the notification

251
00:15:30,526 --> 00:15:33,906
from the camera.

252
00:15:33,906 --> 00:15:37,396
And, yes, the same

253
00:15:37,786 --> 00:15:38,936
on the Apple Watch.

254
00:15:39,706 --> 00:15:41,036
And, yes, touching on the,

255
00:15:41,806 --> 00:15:44,566
on the picture there will

256
00:15:44,796 --> 00:15:47,826
from your HomeKit camera

257
00:15:49,696 --> 00:15:53,396
And, yeah, you can unlock

258
00:15:53,576 --> 00:15:54,776
directly from the Apple Watch.

259
00:15:56,196 --> 00:15:59,856
Next, let's look at the updates

260
00:16:01,676 --> 00:16:05,636
So we'll start off first

261
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:08,266
but very powerful

262
00:16:08,306 --> 00:16:11,336
to the framework that

263
00:16:11,336 --> 00:16:13,816
about the accessory

264
00:16:14,726 --> 00:16:16,606
First up is primary service.

265
00:16:18,016 --> 00:16:20,216
Now this is an example

266
00:16:20,556 --> 00:16:24,726
which has two services - a fan

267
00:16:25,066 --> 00:16:27,446
So this is what your

268
00:16:27,786 --> 00:16:29,436
Now just by looking

269
00:16:29,726 --> 00:16:34,226
it is not clear what the user

270
00:16:35,306 --> 00:16:40,236
Is this a light with an

271
00:16:40,236 --> 00:16:41,116
which also has a light?

272
00:16:42,906 --> 00:16:45,206
Now, with update to

273
00:16:45,206 --> 00:16:48,916
the accessory can mark

274
00:16:49,516 --> 00:16:51,276
and this is available back

275
00:16:51,346 --> 00:16:55,116
to your application using

276
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:56,696
on the HMService class.

277
00:16:57,226 --> 00:16:58,646
Now this will be great for you

278
00:16:59,106 --> 00:17:02,816
because now you can show

279
00:16:59,106 --> 00:17:02,816
because now you can show

280
00:17:02,816 --> 00:17:04,866
about the accessory

281
00:17:07,915 --> 00:17:10,886
Second example is

282
00:17:11,806 --> 00:17:16,326
Here's another example where

283
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:18,366
services and a switch service.

284
00:17:19,476 --> 00:17:21,656
Now, again, by just

285
00:17:21,656 --> 00:17:24,126
it is not clear what

286
00:17:24,665 --> 00:17:26,476
Does the switch control

287
00:17:26,806 --> 00:17:29,256
or any other combination

288
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:33,026
When a user looks

289
00:17:33,496 --> 00:17:37,796
it is clear that that switch

290
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:41,216
Now with linked services,

291
00:17:41,216 --> 00:17:46,136
with each other and communicate

292
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:50,046
to HomeKit, and this is

293
00:17:50,346 --> 00:17:52,686
So in this case, the

294
00:17:52,686 --> 00:17:55,136
to these three outlets

295
00:17:55,136 --> 00:17:56,756
relationship that the switch has

296
00:17:57,036 --> 00:17:58,756
in controlling these

297
00:17:59,336 --> 00:18:02,136
So now for your users, when

298
00:17:59,336 --> 00:18:02,136
So now for your users, when

299
00:18:02,136 --> 00:18:05,546
at your UI, which is

300
00:18:05,546 --> 00:18:07,836
you can now additionally

301
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:10,776
whether it is powered on

302
00:18:10,776 --> 00:18:12,866
that it is linked

303
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:17,866
Third is valid values.

304
00:18:18,346 --> 00:18:21,796
To explain valid values, let's

305
00:18:21,796 --> 00:18:22,756
to build an accessory.

306
00:18:23,346 --> 00:18:25,646
Let's say we're building an

307
00:18:26,536 --> 00:18:27,976
and as we're building

308
00:18:27,976 --> 00:18:31,356
we want to incorporate the

309
00:18:31,626 --> 00:18:32,526
for this accessory.

310
00:18:32,956 --> 00:18:36,696
So we will pick a target and

311
00:18:37,186 --> 00:18:40,786
So this is how it is

312
00:18:41,966 --> 00:18:45,886
Now the air conditioner that we

313
00:18:46,016 --> 00:18:46,736
let's say, heating.

314
00:18:47,816 --> 00:18:51,376
So the heat and the auto

315
00:18:51,376 --> 00:18:52,346
for my configuration.

316
00:18:55,016 --> 00:18:59,456
Now it is possible for

317
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:03,636
in Apple-defined characteristics

318
00:19:03,636 --> 00:19:04,656
for its configuration.

319
00:19:04,976 --> 00:19:08,506
So in this case, the accessory

320
00:19:08,506 --> 00:19:11,846
as not supported, and this

321
00:19:12,126 --> 00:19:14,116
available back to

322
00:19:14,406 --> 00:19:17,756
through the

323
00:19:17,756 --> 00:19:18,686
values property.

324
00:19:20,086 --> 00:19:23,336
Now you can show controls

325
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:28,836
to that particular

326
00:19:28,936 --> 00:19:31,556
Next, setting up of

327
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:36,136
Today, to set up a

328
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:39,436
which is probably the first

329
00:19:40,046 --> 00:19:41,966
involves a few different steps.

330
00:19:43,236 --> 00:19:46,676
First, you will start

331
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:52,506
and once a new accessory is

332
00:19:52,506 --> 00:19:54,786
of your Wi-Fi network, or if

333
00:19:54,786 --> 00:19:57,216
which is in range,

334
00:19:57,216 --> 00:20:01,776
to you via the accessory

335
00:19:57,216 --> 00:20:01,776
to you via the accessory

336
00:20:01,776 --> 00:20:02,666
delegate callback.

337
00:20:04,386 --> 00:20:06,136
And once you have

338
00:20:06,356 --> 00:20:10,226
you can then call the add

339
00:20:10,296 --> 00:20:12,436
to start adding this

340
00:20:15,056 --> 00:20:19,396
But for Wi-Fi accessories

341
00:20:19,396 --> 00:20:21,356
of the user's Wi-Fi

342
00:20:22,586 --> 00:20:24,936
you need to do some

343
00:20:24,936 --> 00:20:27,986
to get these accessories

344
00:20:27,986 --> 00:20:29,366
into the user's Wi-Fi network.

345
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:32,466
You do that today using

346
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:36,596
So there are some additional

347
00:20:36,926 --> 00:20:38,286
We thought we can do better.

348
00:20:39,086 --> 00:20:45,786
So now in iOS 10, we

349
00:20:46,476 --> 00:20:50,756
add and set up accessories

350
00:20:50,756 --> 00:20:52,746
of all the steps

351
00:20:52,856 --> 00:20:56,136
to configure the accessory

352
00:20:56,916 --> 00:21:00,246
So on calling this method,

353
00:20:56,916 --> 00:21:00,246
So on calling this method,

354
00:21:00,596 --> 00:21:04,606
the user is guided

355
00:21:04,926 --> 00:21:06,226
to select the accessory.

356
00:21:06,226 --> 00:21:10,126
So in this case here, it's

357
00:21:10,126 --> 00:21:12,626
as well as accessory,

358
00:21:12,626 --> 00:21:13,976
that are part of

359
00:21:14,576 --> 00:21:17,486
The user can select the

360
00:21:17,486 --> 00:21:20,716
and once it is selected,

361
00:21:20,716 --> 00:21:21,916
of the user's Wi-Fi network,

362
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:24,306
it is added to the user's

363
00:21:25,256 --> 00:21:27,886
Then the HomeKit

364
00:21:29,106 --> 00:21:31,836
and HomeKit pairing is

365
00:21:32,426 --> 00:21:38,166
and then the user is prompted

366
00:21:38,536 --> 00:21:40,216
select a room for the accessory.

367
00:21:40,816 --> 00:21:43,366
And also in this case,

368
00:21:43,366 --> 00:21:45,126
which is generally

369
00:21:45,396 --> 00:21:49,046
the user is also prompt

370
00:21:49,046 --> 00:21:50,756
of accessory is connected

371
00:21:51,126 --> 00:21:53,956
So in our example here,

372
00:21:53,956 --> 00:21:55,156
is being connected to a fan.

373
00:21:55,566 --> 00:21:57,986
So we select the fan as

374
00:21:57,986 --> 00:22:00,076
for this accessory,

375
00:21:57,986 --> 00:22:00,076
for this accessory,

376
00:22:00,076 --> 00:22:03,986
the user can also choose to

377
00:22:03,986 --> 00:22:05,796
of their favorites, and using,

378
00:22:05,796 --> 00:22:09,796
doing that enables this

379
00:22:09,796 --> 00:22:11,426
of their control

380
00:22:12,516 --> 00:22:13,126
So that's it.

381
00:22:13,516 --> 00:22:16,356
Just one simple API,

382
00:22:16,406 --> 00:22:18,246
through this complete

383
00:22:18,726 --> 00:22:22,466
And now all applications

384
00:22:22,626 --> 00:22:24,036
consistent experience.

385
00:22:24,266 --> 00:22:26,096
We think this is going to

386
00:22:26,346 --> 00:22:29,836
and we really encourage all of

387
00:22:32,516 --> 00:22:39,456
[ Applause ]

388
00:22:39,956 --> 00:22:42,856
Next, let's talk about

389
00:22:48,456 --> 00:22:53,436
So a camera is a rich

390
00:22:53,996 --> 00:22:56,596
It has many different

391
00:22:57,866 --> 00:23:00,956
So rather than exposing all the

392
00:22:57,866 --> 00:23:00,956
So rather than exposing all the

393
00:23:00,956 --> 00:23:04,746
to your app, we are providing

394
00:23:04,746 --> 00:23:06,966
to take advantage of

395
00:23:07,506 --> 00:23:09,456
with cameraProfile objects.

396
00:23:10,586 --> 00:23:14,246
A profile is nothing but a

397
00:23:14,586 --> 00:23:17,256
that describe a general

398
00:23:18,136 --> 00:23:21,786
So cameraProfile objects

399
00:23:21,786 --> 00:23:25,556
that is needed for you to

400
00:23:27,876 --> 00:23:31,326
So on an accessory, you can

401
00:23:31,836 --> 00:23:36,306
from the cameraProfile

402
00:23:36,306 --> 00:23:40,646
An accessory can

403
00:23:40,976 --> 00:23:42,646
and those are all

404
00:23:42,966 --> 00:23:44,526
So it will be one

405
00:23:44,526 --> 00:23:45,626
in this cameraProfile array.

406
00:23:45,626 --> 00:23:51,356
Let's look at what a

407
00:23:52,006 --> 00:23:54,436
A cameraProfile provides

408
00:23:54,436 --> 00:23:57,436
that allow you to control

409
00:23:57,786 --> 00:24:00,686
So you can display and

410
00:23:57,786 --> 00:24:00,686
So you can display and

411
00:24:00,966 --> 00:24:03,046
which is both the audio and

412
00:24:04,136 --> 00:24:06,836
display, take and display

413
00:24:08,046 --> 00:24:10,926
control all the settings

414
00:24:10,926 --> 00:24:12,396
as control the speaker

415
00:24:12,396 --> 00:24:14,176
and microphone settings

416
00:24:15,486 --> 00:24:17,956
Let's look at the

417
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:19,476
that provides these interfaces.

418
00:24:20,286 --> 00:24:22,506
First is stream control.

419
00:24:23,536 --> 00:24:25,646
Let's look at HMStreamControl.

420
00:24:25,956 --> 00:24:29,556
So HMStreamControl provides

421
00:24:29,726 --> 00:24:32,936
that allow you to start

422
00:24:32,936 --> 00:24:33,536
from the camera.

423
00:24:34,786 --> 00:24:38,466
So you call the startStream

424
00:24:38,696 --> 00:24:41,706
to start a live stream

425
00:24:42,226 --> 00:24:45,226
Once the stream starts,

426
00:24:45,326 --> 00:24:48,616
to you using the

427
00:24:51,676 --> 00:24:53,036
So once a stream starts,

428
00:24:53,186 --> 00:24:56,996
the camera stream control

429
00:24:57,236 --> 00:24:58,316
that the stream has started.

430
00:24:58,956 --> 00:25:02,336
Similarly, to stop the stream,

431
00:24:58,956 --> 00:25:02,336
Similarly, to stop the stream,

432
00:25:02,836 --> 00:25:06,326
and, again, using the same

433
00:25:06,326 --> 00:25:10,276
to you via the camera

434
00:25:10,276 --> 00:25:11,716
with error delegate callback.

435
00:25:13,916 --> 00:25:18,656
Once the stream is started,

436
00:25:18,656 --> 00:25:22,446
to the stream using via

437
00:25:23,466 --> 00:25:25,596
Let's look at what the

438
00:25:26,866 --> 00:25:30,406
The cameraStream

439
00:25:30,746 --> 00:25:32,536
and the video parts

440
00:25:33,476 --> 00:25:35,366
So on the cameraStream class,

441
00:25:35,776 --> 00:25:38,946
you have additional controls

442
00:25:39,216 --> 00:25:41,326
audio settings from

443
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:45,456
So using this, you can

444
00:25:45,906 --> 00:25:47,946
or fully allow incoming audio

445
00:25:48,366 --> 00:25:51,296
or allow bidirectional

446
00:25:51,926 --> 00:25:56,356
Now that you have a stream,

447
00:25:56,876 --> 00:25:59,546
Well, you would like to

448
00:26:00,426 --> 00:26:03,326
How do you do that?

449
00:26:03,506 --> 00:26:04,736
It's simple.

450
00:26:04,736 --> 00:26:07,456
On iOS 10 and tvOS

451
00:26:07,516 --> 00:26:10,636
to do is create a HMCameraView.

452
00:26:11,336 --> 00:26:16,316
And to the view and on the

453
00:26:16,516 --> 00:26:19,746
the camera source, and you

454
00:26:19,746 --> 00:26:22,066
that you just got when

455
00:26:22,376 --> 00:26:23,096
to this property.

456
00:26:23,386 --> 00:26:23,776
That's it.

457
00:26:24,506 --> 00:26:26,446
All that is needed for your app

458
00:26:26,546 --> 00:26:31,306
to show live stream

459
00:26:31,456 --> 00:26:33,016
It's very similar on watch OS.

460
00:26:33,306 --> 00:26:36,516
You just create an

461
00:26:36,696 --> 00:26:39,926
and call the setCameraSource

462
00:26:40,366 --> 00:26:45,326
to show live stream

463
00:26:45,746 --> 00:26:50,526
So those were a few different

464
00:26:51,566 --> 00:26:53,616
to control your camera

465
00:26:53,956 --> 00:26:55,456
but in reality, it's

466
00:26:55,456 --> 00:26:57,746
Let's look at an example call.

467
00:27:00,246 --> 00:27:03,726
So first we get to our

468
00:27:03,896 --> 00:27:06,976
and in this case, we're just

469
00:27:06,976 --> 00:27:11,016
that is there, and on the

470
00:27:11,426 --> 00:27:12,736
we call the startStream method

471
00:27:12,996 --> 00:27:14,386
which will start

472
00:27:15,016 --> 00:27:19,956
And to display our stream,

473
00:27:21,116 --> 00:27:23,186
and once our stream is started,

474
00:27:23,896 --> 00:27:26,636
it's informed back via

475
00:27:26,766 --> 00:27:28,716
cameraStreamControl

476
00:27:29,266 --> 00:27:33,416
and all that we need to do here

477
00:27:33,826 --> 00:27:35,836
to the camera source

478
00:27:36,366 --> 00:27:36,786
That's it.

479
00:27:37,226 --> 00:27:40,156
Now your view in your

480
00:27:40,156 --> 00:27:41,326
stream from the camera.

481
00:27:45,336 --> 00:27:47,486
Next, let's look

482
00:27:47,736 --> 00:27:50,366
Snapshot control interfaces

483
00:27:50,366 --> 00:27:52,136
to what we saw with

484
00:27:53,606 --> 00:27:57,476
So for snapshotControl we

485
00:27:57,976 --> 00:28:01,366
which once a snapshot

486
00:27:57,976 --> 00:28:01,366
which once a snapshot

487
00:28:01,446 --> 00:28:05,546
to you via the

488
00:28:05,546 --> 00:28:07,156
snapshot method callback.

489
00:28:07,846 --> 00:28:12,166
And the most recent snapshot

490
00:28:12,536 --> 00:28:14,796
in this most recent

491
00:28:15,086 --> 00:28:17,726
Let's look at the

492
00:28:17,726 --> 00:28:22,276
The SnapshotControl has

493
00:28:22,496 --> 00:28:24,056
which will show you

494
00:28:24,056 --> 00:28:27,116
of when this snapshot

495
00:28:27,116 --> 00:28:28,756
It has both the time and date.

496
00:28:30,116 --> 00:28:35,816
And, again, similarly,

497
00:28:35,816 --> 00:28:38,506
into a view, all that you

498
00:28:38,806 --> 00:28:41,036
and assign it to this snapshot.

499
00:28:42,816 --> 00:28:44,596
So here's an example to take

500
00:28:44,596 --> 00:28:46,286
and display a snapshot

501
00:28:46,676 --> 00:28:48,956
It's very similar, core

502
00:28:49,636 --> 00:28:51,456
First we get to our

503
00:28:52,876 --> 00:28:55,346
On this cameraProfile's

504
00:28:55,806 --> 00:28:57,616
we call the takeSnapshot method.

505
00:28:58,436 --> 00:29:01,256
We create a view to

506
00:28:58,436 --> 00:29:01,256
We create a view to

507
00:29:01,926 --> 00:29:05,536
and once a delegate is

508
00:29:05,536 --> 00:29:07,506
with a reference

509
00:29:07,866 --> 00:29:09,676
We just take that and assign it

510
00:29:09,736 --> 00:29:11,766
to the camera's source

511
00:29:12,136 --> 00:29:12,516
That's it.

512
00:29:13,106 --> 00:29:19,936
That's all you need to show

513
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:21,526
Next, let's look

514
00:29:21,526 --> 00:29:25,916
So settingControl gives you HM

515
00:29:25,916 --> 00:29:28,786
to control all the settings that

516
00:29:31,756 --> 00:29:35,476
So you have interfaces to

517
00:29:35,956 --> 00:29:39,856
zoom, rotation, and

518
00:29:40,186 --> 00:29:43,346
So if the cameraSupport does

519
00:29:43,656 --> 00:29:45,076
then that property will be nil.

520
00:29:45,496 --> 00:29:48,286
Otherwise, you have full access

521
00:29:48,526 --> 00:29:50,866
of this camera from your app.

522
00:29:54,696 --> 00:29:58,876
Last, we'll look at camera

523
00:29:58,876 --> 00:30:00,446
to control both the speaker

524
00:29:58,876 --> 00:30:00,446
to control both the speaker

525
00:30:00,506 --> 00:30:02,476
and microphone settings

526
00:30:03,856 --> 00:30:06,206
Again, these are also

527
00:30:06,656 --> 00:30:08,926
which will allow you to

528
00:30:08,926 --> 00:30:12,016
on the microphone, change the

529
00:30:12,636 --> 00:30:14,296
control the gain

530
00:30:14,576 --> 00:30:16,996
or control the speaker volume.

531
00:30:18,006 --> 00:30:21,506
So those are all the key API's

532
00:30:21,846 --> 00:30:27,946
to take advantage of

533
00:30:28,136 --> 00:30:29,126
So let's summarize.

534
00:30:29,766 --> 00:30:32,006
We covered three major areas.

535
00:30:32,986 --> 00:30:34,646
First, platform.

536
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:40,396
We're bringing the home app, an

537
00:30:42,016 --> 00:30:43,736
For remote access

538
00:30:43,736 --> 00:30:46,166
We're extending the capabilities

539
00:30:46,166 --> 00:30:49,106
as adding iPad to

540
00:30:49,106 --> 00:30:51,956
and automation capability

541
00:30:53,016 --> 00:30:56,626
We're bringing HomeKit

542
00:30:59,006 --> 00:31:04,106
Next area on accessories,

543
00:30:59,006 --> 00:31:04,106
Next area on accessories,

544
00:31:04,186 --> 00:31:05,646
of air treatment accessories.

545
00:31:07,186 --> 00:31:09,936
We're adding powerful

546
00:31:09,966 --> 00:31:11,096
to the HomeKit ecosystem.

547
00:31:12,396 --> 00:31:15,986
And we're also adding doorbells

548
00:31:15,986 --> 00:31:17,546
which are doorbell cameras.

549
00:31:18,116 --> 00:31:23,856
On the framework

550
00:31:24,046 --> 00:31:27,796
but powerful capabilities that

551
00:31:27,796 --> 00:31:29,326
about your accessory

552
00:31:29,666 --> 00:31:30,666
So you can show rich

553
00:31:30,926 --> 00:31:33,486
and context-sensitive

554
00:31:34,036 --> 00:31:37,446
We have greatly simplified

555
00:31:37,776 --> 00:31:39,136
Now with just one API call,

556
00:31:39,196 --> 00:31:42,646
all apps get the consistent

557
00:31:42,986 --> 00:31:46,346
through the complete setup for,

558
00:31:46,876 --> 00:31:50,316
And we introduced cam,

559
00:31:50,656 --> 00:31:53,756
that allow your applications

560
00:31:53,966 --> 00:32:00,086
of this powerful

561
00:31:53,966 --> 00:32:00,086
of this powerful

562
00:32:00,086 --> 00:32:04,706
Now before I conclude, I want

563
00:32:05,596 --> 00:32:10,516
HomeKit accessories and your

564
00:32:10,556 --> 00:32:15,766
way that our users

565
00:32:15,956 --> 00:32:21,476
With system features like Siri,

566
00:32:22,586 --> 00:32:27,406
also combined with the rich

567
00:32:27,406 --> 00:32:30,506
on Apple platforms like

568
00:32:31,176 --> 00:32:34,536
these accessories are,

569
00:32:34,896 --> 00:32:37,076
becoming accessible to users

570
00:32:37,076 --> 00:32:39,236
with various kinds

571
00:32:40,046 --> 00:32:44,076
This is powerful, and it is

572
00:32:44,076 --> 00:32:45,676
for many of our users.

573
00:32:46,476 --> 00:32:50,346
