00:00:24,776 --> 00:00:25,436
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon.

4
00:00:28,346 --> 00:00:30,166
Hi. My name is Matthew

5
00:00:30,736 --> 00:00:34,106
I'm a software engineer working

6
00:00:34,106 --> 00:00:38,396
to talk about Focus

7
00:00:39,016 --> 00:00:42,696
Last year we introduced

8
00:00:42,886 --> 00:00:44,556
for building apps on Apple TV.

9
00:00:46,306 --> 00:00:48,796
And whether you're building

10
00:00:49,146 --> 00:00:52,636
or looking to port an existing

11
00:00:53,146 --> 00:00:54,276
it's immediately obvious

12
00:00:54,376 --> 00:00:56,926
that Apple TV is unlike

13
00:00:58,046 --> 00:01:02,256
There's no touchscreen on a TV

14
00:00:58,046 --> 00:01:02,256
There's no touchscreen on a TV

15
00:01:02,256 --> 00:01:04,215
of user input just

16
00:01:04,215 --> 00:01:05,546
in a living room environment.

17
00:01:06,186 --> 00:01:10,866
Instead, we use this, a

18
00:01:11,246 --> 00:01:13,926
in order to control

19
00:01:15,056 --> 00:01:18,386
The Siri Remote and Apple TV

20
00:01:18,856 --> 00:01:21,046
to provide the best

21
00:01:21,566 --> 00:01:26,046
But Apple TV also supports

22
00:01:26,556 --> 00:01:29,096
like game controllers,

23
00:01:29,096 --> 00:01:31,486
and the new remote app.

24
00:01:32,036 --> 00:01:35,276
And sometimes users might feel

25
00:01:35,276 --> 00:01:39,316
of these other input devices in

26
00:01:39,926 --> 00:01:42,396
and tvOS helps you

27
00:01:42,786 --> 00:01:46,046
through a user interaction

28
00:01:46,386 --> 00:01:51,636
With Focus interaction, users

29
00:01:52,236 --> 00:01:54,616
through a single focused

30
00:01:55,226 --> 00:01:56,296
and they can move focus

31
00:01:56,346 --> 00:01:58,946
around the screen

32
00:02:00,456 --> 00:02:05,006
Users will expect that your

33
00:02:05,006 --> 00:02:06,016
with Focus interaction.

34
00:02:06,916 --> 00:02:10,566
And to help with that, UIKit

35
00:02:10,566 --> 00:02:14,446
for all of its standard

36
00:02:14,476 --> 00:02:17,576
you may also want to customize

37
00:02:17,576 --> 00:02:19,086
in order to take them

38
00:02:19,086 --> 00:02:21,466
and provide an even

39
00:02:21,966 --> 00:02:24,896
And for that, UIKit

40
00:02:25,746 --> 00:02:30,016
Now today's talk is

41
00:02:30,276 --> 00:02:31,936
and we split it into two parts.

42
00:02:32,336 --> 00:02:34,596
First, we're going to

43
00:02:34,596 --> 00:02:36,656
in the Focus API

44
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:40,926
And then in the second part

45
00:02:40,926 --> 00:02:43,736
into an extended case study

46
00:02:44,106 --> 00:02:46,716
fully focusable control

47
00:02:47,286 --> 00:02:49,066
This is a great demo

48
00:02:49,066 --> 00:02:51,876
to get started building

49
00:02:51,876 --> 00:02:54,516
in your tvOS apps.

50
00:02:54,516 --> 00:02:55,906
Now a quick note

51
00:02:56,696 --> 00:02:59,576
We're going to assume that you

52
00:02:59,626 --> 00:03:01,836
with the Focus API

53
00:02:59,626 --> 00:03:01,836
with the Focus API

54
00:03:02,156 --> 00:03:04,126
of how Focus works on tvOS.

55
00:03:04,536 --> 00:03:07,416
But even if you're new to

56
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:10,416
You can still generally

57
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:12,736
of the talk today, we'll call

58
00:03:13,056 --> 00:03:18,286
to help you get started with

59
00:03:19,476 --> 00:03:25,256
So what's new in tvOS 10 and to

60
00:03:26,126 --> 00:03:28,556
to enhance the preferred

61
00:03:28,646 --> 00:03:33,056
Now as a quick review, when

62
00:03:33,336 --> 00:03:35,236
we mean the process

63
00:03:35,236 --> 00:03:38,966
where Focus should show

64
00:03:39,696 --> 00:03:41,256
Whenever Focus updates,

65
00:03:41,326 --> 00:03:44,746
for example when your app first

66
00:03:44,746 --> 00:03:46,646
to know where focus

67
00:03:47,356 --> 00:03:48,906
It does this by asking your app

68
00:03:49,886 --> 00:03:52,036
where it prefers

69
00:03:52,886 --> 00:03:54,696
Let's look at a specific

70
00:03:55,836 --> 00:03:59,216
When your app first launches,

71
00:03:59,216 --> 00:04:01,466
to figure out where Focus

72
00:03:59,216 --> 00:04:01,466
to figure out where Focus

73
00:04:02,016 --> 00:04:05,156
and it's going to start by

74
00:04:05,546 --> 00:04:06,816
that we're updating Focus to.

75
00:04:07,056 --> 00:04:08,826
And when our app first

76
00:04:09,476 --> 00:04:12,936
In this case, the Focus engine

77
00:04:12,966 --> 00:04:14,416
preferred Focus view is.

78
00:04:15,186 --> 00:04:17,055
The window delegates

79
00:04:17,055 --> 00:04:18,326
to its root view controller,

80
00:04:18,886 --> 00:04:22,416
which could also return some

81
00:04:22,606 --> 00:04:24,086
as its preferred Focus view.

82
00:04:24,956 --> 00:04:26,196
The Focus engine will then ask

83
00:04:26,196 --> 00:04:28,296
that view what its

84
00:04:28,296 --> 00:04:30,286
and it will continue

85
00:04:30,766 --> 00:04:33,296
until it reaches the end, which

86
00:04:33,296 --> 00:04:36,776
that it found as the new

87
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:40,716
Leveraging the Preferred

88
00:04:40,716 --> 00:04:42,756
to provide a good

89
00:04:42,936 --> 00:04:44,636
in complex apps, especially.

90
00:04:44,636 --> 00:04:48,176
So that focus is directed to

91
00:04:48,236 --> 00:04:49,646
at the appropriate times.

92
00:04:50,196 --> 00:04:54,456
In tvOS 10, we're

93
00:04:54,456 --> 00:04:58,376
that allows your apps to

94
00:04:58,446 --> 00:05:01,536
preferences and the name of this

95
00:04:58,446 --> 00:05:01,536
preferences and the name of this

96
00:05:01,936 --> 00:05:04,336
Preferred Focus Environments

97
00:05:04,336 --> 00:05:07,806
in the UIFocusEnvironment

98
00:05:07,806 --> 00:05:09,976
of objects that also conform to

99
00:05:10,246 --> 00:05:13,876
And this property has

100
00:05:14,366 --> 00:05:19,246
First, by returning objects that

101
00:05:20,216 --> 00:05:23,726
you can specify that focus be

102
00:05:23,726 --> 00:05:26,556
on screen, not just views but

103
00:05:27,766 --> 00:05:29,756
The second benefit

104
00:05:29,756 --> 00:05:32,486
that it returns an array of

105
00:05:32,986 --> 00:05:35,696
which allows you to specify

106
00:05:36,216 --> 00:05:39,266
and this enables complex,

107
00:05:39,266 --> 00:05:41,206
to be expressed much

108
00:05:42,326 --> 00:05:46,286
And there's a specific pattern

109
00:05:46,906 --> 00:05:49,146
that Preferred Focus

110
00:05:49,146 --> 00:05:51,556
in which is custom

111
00:05:51,736 --> 00:05:55,586
Let's look at an

112
00:05:56,566 --> 00:05:58,776
Say we have an app with a

113
00:05:59,486 --> 00:06:01,156
We have a container

114
00:05:59,486 --> 00:06:01,156
We have a container

115
00:06:01,386 --> 00:06:03,466
with two child view controllers.

116
00:06:04,826 --> 00:06:06,966
In this example, we want

117
00:06:06,966 --> 00:06:09,976
that focus show up in the left

118
00:06:10,766 --> 00:06:13,396
but if that's not possible,

119
00:06:13,396 --> 00:06:14,946
to its right child

120
00:06:15,796 --> 00:06:19,276
And we can express this logic

121
00:06:19,466 --> 00:06:21,236
preferredFocusEnvironments

122
00:06:22,356 --> 00:06:25,726
Here, we override

123
00:06:25,906 --> 00:06:29,026
to return an array of both

124
00:06:29,026 --> 00:06:30,676
as the first item in the array.

125
00:06:32,466 --> 00:06:33,816
This is great because

126
00:06:33,816 --> 00:06:36,396
to check ourselves whether

127
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:37,986
actually contains

128
00:06:37,986 --> 00:06:39,186
We don't have to know anything

129
00:06:39,186 --> 00:06:41,116
about the contents

130
00:06:41,846 --> 00:06:44,126
We just tell the Focus engine

131
00:06:44,336 --> 00:06:47,566
and it takes care of

132
00:06:47,686 --> 00:06:49,246
So if our left child

133
00:06:49,246 --> 00:06:52,356
in this example happened to

134
00:06:52,726 --> 00:06:54,506
the Focus engine will

135
00:06:54,906 --> 00:06:56,706
to that right child

136
00:06:56,706 --> 00:06:59,786
And in this example, maybe it

137
00:07:00,346 --> 00:07:03,546
So the

138
00:07:03,576 --> 00:07:06,376
property helps us to express

139
00:07:06,376 --> 00:07:07,456
clearly and concisely,

140
00:07:08,156 --> 00:07:11,006
and if the first item doesn't

141
00:07:11,006 --> 00:07:16,146
we can easily fall back to the

142
00:07:16,146 --> 00:07:17,686
Next up, we have

143
00:07:17,686 --> 00:07:19,836
to the Preferred Focus

144
00:07:19,836 --> 00:07:23,496
for more specific use case

145
00:07:23,716 --> 00:07:25,376
after view controller

146
00:07:26,726 --> 00:07:30,186
So before we introduce the API,

147
00:07:30,186 --> 00:07:33,546
to illustrate what exactly

148
00:07:34,016 --> 00:07:38,326
Say we have an app

149
00:07:38,726 --> 00:07:41,526
It's a simple view controller

150
00:07:41,906 --> 00:07:44,126
And our root view

151
00:07:44,126 --> 00:07:46,886
that by default we want our

152
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:49,156
It did this using the

153
00:07:49,156 --> 00:07:51,516
property that we just looked at.

154
00:07:51,866 --> 00:07:54,886
Now suppose the user moves to

155
00:07:55,296 --> 00:07:56,386
and selects that button

156
00:07:56,796 --> 00:07:58,586
to present a detail

157
00:07:59,096 --> 00:08:02,516
In that case we're

158
00:07:59,096 --> 00:08:02,516
In that case we're

159
00:08:02,516 --> 00:08:04,806
when this detail view

160
00:08:06,326 --> 00:08:09,746
After the dismissal, focus

161
00:08:10,246 --> 00:08:11,596
to our root view controller.

162
00:08:13,436 --> 00:08:15,306
Now the user would

163
00:08:15,946 --> 00:08:18,126
that focus gets restored

164
00:08:18,216 --> 00:08:20,326
that was last focused,

165
00:08:20,506 --> 00:08:22,636
which is the last

166
00:08:23,926 --> 00:08:26,276
However, if we ask our

167
00:08:26,276 --> 00:08:29,136
at this time what its preferred

168
00:08:29,626 --> 00:08:31,836
it would still direct us to

169
00:08:33,376 --> 00:08:36,316
And so instead, the Focus engine

170
00:08:36,316 --> 00:08:40,645
focus item for us so that after

171
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:43,556
it automatically restores

172
00:08:43,655 --> 00:08:45,406
that the user would expect.

173
00:08:46,516 --> 00:08:48,996
This is behavior that

174
00:08:51,396 --> 00:08:54,236
While this is almost always

175
00:08:54,236 --> 00:08:57,496
and often the developer

176
00:08:57,496 --> 00:08:59,796
where you might want to

177
00:08:59,796 --> 00:09:00,886
of your user interface.

178
00:08:59,796 --> 00:09:00,886
of your user interface.

179
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:05,096
Suppose for example that while

180
00:09:05,286 --> 00:09:07,466
our app's underlying

181
00:09:07,466 --> 00:09:10,096
so that the last button

182
00:09:10,096 --> 00:09:12,486
different action or data

183
00:09:13,056 --> 00:09:16,446
In that case the user might not

184
00:09:16,446 --> 00:09:18,166
restored back to that last item.

185
00:09:19,526 --> 00:09:21,646
In that case, we

186
00:09:22,256 --> 00:09:25,326
to use your view controller's

187
00:09:25,866 --> 00:09:28,516
in order to determine where

188
00:09:28,856 --> 00:09:30,576
And in tvOS 10, we're

189
00:09:30,876 --> 00:09:33,566
that allows you to do just that.

190
00:09:33,896 --> 00:09:36,636
It's called

191
00:09:37,036 --> 00:09:40,706
It's a Boolean property

192
00:09:41,656 --> 00:09:42,936
and the way it works

193
00:09:43,816 --> 00:09:47,126
If set to true, the view

194
00:09:47,126 --> 00:09:47,916
default behavior.

195
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:49,496
It'll tell the Focus engine

196
00:09:49,736 --> 00:09:53,326
to use its default behavior

197
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:55,266
that was focused before

198
00:09:56,576 --> 00:09:58,056
If set to false, however,

199
00:09:58,126 --> 00:10:00,736
then the Focus engine will

200
00:09:58,126 --> 00:10:00,736
then the Focus engine will

201
00:10:00,736 --> 00:10:02,776
controller's

202
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,476
giving your app a

203
00:10:05,476 --> 00:10:06,976
where focus gets

204
00:10:07,046 --> 00:10:11,966
The property is set to

205
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:13,626
that previous default behavior

206
00:10:14,856 --> 00:10:16,806
and it affects view

207
00:10:16,806 --> 00:10:17,756
like we just talked about,

208
00:10:18,276 --> 00:10:22,046
but other common built-in view

209
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:26,676
such as navigation pops and

210
00:10:26,676 --> 00:10:28,536
between your view

211
00:10:29,966 --> 00:10:31,956
We recommend that when

212
00:10:32,526 --> 00:10:36,546
set it always be true or always

213
00:10:36,546 --> 00:10:37,616
within your view controllers

214
00:10:37,616 --> 00:10:41,396
in a consistent and

215
00:10:41,826 --> 00:10:43,836
We really hope that this

216
00:10:43,836 --> 00:10:46,606
some of those tricky edge cases

217
00:10:48,956 --> 00:10:50,936
To show you how to use

218
00:10:50,936 --> 00:10:52,876

00:11:06,636 --> 00:11:07,176
&gt;&gt; Hi, everyone.

222
00:11:07,466 --> 00:11:09,446
My name is Brandon and I'm

223
00:11:09,446 --> 00:11:10,596
to take advantage of some

224
00:11:10,596 --> 00:11:14,006
of the new Focus APIs

225
00:11:14,756 --> 00:11:17,386
So I've been working on

226
00:11:17,386 --> 00:11:19,116
and it's coming along

227
00:11:19,896 --> 00:11:23,456
You can view your events for a

228
00:11:23,456 --> 00:11:25,546
between weeks using the

229
00:11:26,556 --> 00:11:28,976
Now when the app

230
00:11:28,976 --> 00:11:30,036
on the previous button

231
00:11:30,736 --> 00:11:33,286
when I think it would

232
00:11:33,286 --> 00:11:35,186
if we focused on the

233
00:11:35,326 --> 00:11:37,356
So let's go modify

234
00:11:38,086 --> 00:11:41,756
So to direct focus, we need

235
00:11:41,756 --> 00:11:43,636
to override the

236
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:44,086
property.

237
00:11:45,336 --> 00:11:47,826
This returns an array

238
00:11:47,826 --> 00:11:49,576
for the focus engine

239
00:11:50,026 --> 00:11:52,816
We'll start by adding our

240
00:11:52,816 --> 00:11:53,836
of the week to our array.

241
00:11:54,516 --> 00:11:57,246
If we have no more upcoming

242
00:11:57,306 --> 00:11:58,686
to default to the next button.

243
00:11:58,986 --> 00:12:00,546
So we'll add that to

244
00:11:58,986 --> 00:12:00,546
So we'll add that to

245
00:12:01,676 --> 00:12:02,966
Now let's run this,

246
00:12:11,196 --> 00:12:14,116
All right, so this time when

247
00:12:14,116 --> 00:12:16,446
on the super secret party I'm

248
00:12:17,196 --> 00:12:19,846
Now, I wonder what would happen

249
00:12:20,466 --> 00:12:21,826
When an event is canceled,

250
00:12:21,956 --> 00:12:24,136
it becomes grayed

251
00:12:25,106 --> 00:12:27,776
So I would expect focus would

252
00:12:27,776 --> 00:12:29,566
which is a tvOS lab

253
00:12:30,206 --> 00:12:31,846
But a good developer

254
00:12:31,846 --> 00:12:32,936
So let's go try this out.

255
00:12:32,936 --> 00:12:36,546
So I'm going to go

256
00:12:36,586 --> 00:12:40,976
and cancel my not-so-secret

257
00:12:47,776 --> 00:12:51,006
All right, just as we

258
00:12:51,006 --> 00:12:52,376
we're focused on the tvOS lab.

259
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:55,406
So because our first

260
00:12:55,676 --> 00:12:57,986
unfocusable, the Focus

261
00:12:57,986 --> 00:12:59,486
to our next preferred

262
00:13:00,006 --> 00:13:02,536
We didn't have to modify

263
00:13:02,536 --> 00:13:04,666
The Focus engine

264
00:13:05,446 --> 00:13:07,876
Now if you want to view

265
00:13:07,956 --> 00:13:09,896
you can select it to

266
00:13:10,506 --> 00:13:12,336
From here, you can swipe

267
00:13:12,336 --> 00:13:13,766
to the next or previous event.

268
00:13:13,766 --> 00:13:17,406
I received some bug

269
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:20,766
that when they exit this view,

270
00:13:20,766 --> 00:13:22,066
that was just selected.

271
00:13:22,396 --> 00:13:24,316
So in this case, we've

272
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:26,196
So if I menu out, I would expect

273
00:13:26,196 --> 00:13:29,386
that we would be

274
00:13:29,586 --> 00:13:32,106
Instead, we're still

275
00:13:32,236 --> 00:13:34,886
which is our first available

276
00:13:35,626 --> 00:13:38,026
So all we need to do is update

277
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:39,916
code to return our

278
00:13:40,406 --> 00:13:42,606
as our preferred

279
00:13:43,296 --> 00:13:45,646
So let's go back to our

280
00:13:46,086 --> 00:13:49,226
and I have the selectedEventView

281
00:13:49,226 --> 00:13:51,466
of the selected event when

282
00:13:52,096 --> 00:13:54,976
So if this property

283
00:13:54,976 --> 00:13:56,846
as my first preferred

284
00:13:56,926 --> 00:13:59,546
All right, let's run

285
00:14:05,866 --> 00:14:09,266
Okay. So I'll select the

286
00:14:09,266 --> 00:14:11,266
to the bash, and then menu out,

287
00:14:12,076 --> 00:14:14,146
and we're still focused

288
00:14:14,206 --> 00:14:17,186
And I'm remembering now

289
00:14:17,186 --> 00:14:18,906
in the session that by default,

290
00:14:18,906 --> 00:14:20,626
the Focus engine

291
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:23,106
preferredFocusEnvironments

292
00:14:23,106 --> 00:14:24,956
from a view controller.

293
00:14:25,546 --> 00:14:26,746
So to change that behavior,

294
00:14:27,146 --> 00:14:29,696
we need to set the

295
00:14:29,696 --> 00:14:30,786
property to false.

296
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:34,836
So let's go do that in our

297
00:14:35,396 --> 00:14:36,946
and rerun the app,

298
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:46,436
All right, we'll select

299
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:49,356
move our selection to

300
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:52,076
Awesome, so now we're

301
00:14:52,076 --> 00:14:53,486
which is exactly what we wanted.

302
00:14:54,796 --> 00:14:56,756
So by using the

303
00:14:56,936 --> 00:14:59,246
and restoresFocusAfterTransition

304
00:14:59,316 --> 00:15:02,196
we're able to provide a much

305
00:14:59,316 --> 00:15:02,196
we're able to provide a much

306
00:15:02,806 --> 00:15:03,976
Now I'd like to invite

307
00:15:04,516 --> 00:15:09,736

&gt;&gt; Thanks, Brandon.

309
00:15:11,616 --> 00:15:12,556
That was a really great demo.

310
00:15:13,276 --> 00:15:14,916
Using these two new properties,

311
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:17,616
we hope that you can reduce the

312
00:15:18,206 --> 00:15:20,226
and also provide a

313
00:15:22,276 --> 00:15:26,476
Now, next up I'm really

314
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:30,096
that we're bringing focus

315
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:31,026
into SpriteKit.

316
00:15:32,636 --> 00:15:35,996
Prior to tvOS 10,

317
00:15:35,996 --> 00:15:38,316
to manually implement

318
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:41,646
in their SpriteKit games

319
00:15:41,646 --> 00:15:45,656
of their own state and

320
00:15:46,226 --> 00:15:50,736
But now in tvOS 10, we're

321
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:53,686
the same API you're

322
00:15:54,066 --> 00:15:57,226
to also support your

323
00:15:58,476 --> 00:16:04,746
But first, what would

324
00:15:58,476 --> 00:16:04,746
But first, what would

325
00:16:04,856 --> 00:16:08,366
Well the first and most obvious

326
00:16:08,556 --> 00:16:10,996
in games is game menus.

327
00:16:12,156 --> 00:16:16,126
Your users will expect

328
00:16:16,126 --> 00:16:19,866
and behave similar to

329
00:16:21,036 --> 00:16:25,106
The Focus Interaction model also

330
00:16:25,596 --> 00:16:28,206
where users navigate around

331
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:31,816
and select items on that game

332
00:16:32,066 --> 00:16:35,146
And in fact, Focus Interaction

333
00:16:35,756 --> 00:16:38,876
where selection is a

334
00:16:39,686 --> 00:16:41,126
And in any of this use cases,

335
00:16:41,196 --> 00:16:44,096
again users will expect

336
00:16:44,416 --> 00:16:46,686
to feel similar to the

337
00:16:47,246 --> 00:16:51,226
Otherwise, your app might feel

338
00:16:51,766 --> 00:16:57,706
And so to help with that, we've

339
00:16:57,706 --> 00:17:02,196
that you're used to in UIKit to

340
00:16:57,706 --> 00:17:02,196
that you're used to in UIKit to

341
00:17:02,446 --> 00:17:05,096
This is a shared API,

342
00:17:05,096 --> 00:17:09,756
that SKNodes are now able to

343
00:17:10,556 --> 00:17:12,195
and taking advantage of all

344
00:17:12,195 --> 00:17:14,546
of the Focus engine's

345
00:17:16,106 --> 00:17:19,346
UIKit and SpriteKit have been

346
00:17:19,346 --> 00:17:21,915
to move freely between

347
00:17:21,955 --> 00:17:24,165
so you don't have to handle

348
00:17:26,256 --> 00:17:30,896
So how exactly does this work?

349
00:17:31,086 --> 00:17:34,766
First, let's review how

350
00:17:35,386 --> 00:17:39,196
Prior to tvOS 10, UIViews were

351
00:17:39,256 --> 00:17:41,016
that were capable

352
00:17:41,256 --> 00:17:43,796
and they defined their

353
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:45,746
canBecomeFocused property.

354
00:17:47,806 --> 00:17:52,716
UIViews also conform to the

355
00:17:53,526 --> 00:17:56,576
And this allows views to get

356
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:58,766
and also control the

357
00:17:58,766 --> 00:18:00,206
within their subview hierarchy.

358
00:17:58,766 --> 00:18:00,206
within their subview hierarchy.

359
00:18:00,956 --> 00:18:04,986
So to support SpriteKit

360
00:18:04,986 --> 00:18:07,856
to bring these same

361
00:18:08,286 --> 00:18:10,106
and we've made some

362
00:18:10,676 --> 00:18:12,626
We're abstracting

363
00:18:12,626 --> 00:18:15,686
out into their own protocol

364
00:18:16,206 --> 00:18:20,786
This protocol defines both

365
00:18:21,676 --> 00:18:24,566
and conformance to the

366
00:18:26,496 --> 00:18:30,876
Next, we refactored

367
00:18:31,056 --> 00:18:32,886
to conform to this new protocol.

368
00:18:33,776 --> 00:18:35,906
And this allows both

369
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:40,696
to share these exact same API

370
00:18:40,696 --> 00:18:43,046
in your existing UIKit code.

371
00:18:44,356 --> 00:18:46,846
We've also made additions to

372
00:18:47,066 --> 00:18:50,556
in order to take advantage of

373
00:18:51,936 --> 00:18:54,856
First, let's look at the

374
00:18:55,396 --> 00:18:58,066
which provides contextual

375
00:18:58,066 --> 00:18:59,496
update notifications.

376
00:19:00,866 --> 00:19:03,546
In order to support focus

377
00:19:03,776 --> 00:19:06,816
we're introducing two new

378
00:19:07,476 --> 00:19:10,186
previouslyFocusedItem

379
00:19:10,886 --> 00:19:14,016
and these tell you which items

380
00:19:14,946 --> 00:19:17,526
We've made a similar

381
00:19:17,896 --> 00:19:21,196
introducing a new focusedItem

382
00:19:21,196 --> 00:19:23,916
to type UIFocusItem and

383
00:19:24,116 --> 00:19:29,596
to query what the current focus

384
00:19:29,936 --> 00:19:32,476
Now there's one more API

385
00:19:32,476 --> 00:19:34,156
but it requires a little

386
00:19:34,986 --> 00:19:39,346
In tvOS 9, the UIFocusItem

387
00:19:39,346 --> 00:19:41,126
preferredFocusView property.

388
00:19:41,126 --> 00:19:46,076
And prior to tvOS 10, this was

389
00:19:46,076 --> 00:19:48,386
preferences, like we were

390
00:19:49,536 --> 00:19:51,656
But you can probably

391
00:19:51,956 --> 00:19:54,246
which is that it

392
00:19:54,726 --> 00:19:58,216
And if we're going to support

393
00:19:58,276 --> 00:20:00,576
to define focus preferences

394
00:19:58,276 --> 00:20:00,576
to define focus preferences

395
00:20:00,576 --> 00:20:01,976
And so this isn't going to work.

396
00:20:02,176 --> 00:20:07,336
But luckily, earlier

397
00:20:07,816 --> 00:20:10,006
we introduced this new

398
00:20:10,386 --> 00:20:12,196
property, which does

399
00:20:12,516 --> 00:20:15,656
But because it returns an array

400
00:20:15,656 --> 00:20:19,316
and now SKNode conforms to the

401
00:20:20,576 --> 00:20:22,836
we can now define focus

402
00:20:22,976 --> 00:20:26,566
view controller, SKNodes,

403
00:20:26,566 --> 00:20:27,706
to UIFocusEnvironment.

404
00:20:28,476 --> 00:20:30,506
And this makes defining

405
00:20:30,506 --> 00:20:33,026
in your environments

406
00:20:34,256 --> 00:20:36,776
And because

407
00:20:36,776 --> 00:20:39,166
care of all the use cases

408
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:40,856
but also provides

409
00:20:40,976 --> 00:20:43,446
that we've talked about,

410
00:20:43,446 --> 00:20:44,956
to deprecate preferredFocusView.

411
00:20:45,546 --> 00:20:49,036
So if you're currently

412
00:20:49,036 --> 00:20:52,106
in your applications,

413
00:20:52,106 --> 00:20:54,246
to preferredFocusEnvironments

414
00:20:55,476 --> 00:20:57,066
We think this will really help.

415
00:20:58,336 --> 00:21:01,336
So that's Focus Interaction

416
00:20:58,336 --> 00:21:01,336
So that's Focus Interaction

417
00:21:02,126 --> 00:21:05,546
Focus API now supports generic

418
00:21:05,546 --> 00:21:07,036
UIFocusItem protocol.

419
00:21:07,756 --> 00:21:10,626
Both UIView and SKNode

420
00:21:11,516 --> 00:21:13,736
And for SpriteKit

421
00:21:13,736 --> 00:21:15,906
in to supporting focus

422
00:21:16,256 --> 00:21:18,316
of all the Focus

423
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:22,376
For UIKit developers that don't

424
00:21:23,076 --> 00:21:24,336
there are no changes required.

425
00:21:24,546 --> 00:21:26,876
The view-based API

426
00:21:26,876 --> 00:21:30,766
of preferredFocusView is still

427
00:21:31,586 --> 00:21:34,556
We do encourage you, however,

428
00:21:34,736 --> 00:21:37,946
in your code to take advantage

429
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:41,276
of more generic and

430
00:21:43,216 --> 00:21:46,906
For more details on exactly

431
00:21:46,906 --> 00:21:48,826
in to focus support in

432
00:21:49,446 --> 00:21:51,006
we recommend watching

433
00:21:51,006 --> 00:21:53,426
in SpriteKit session happening

434
00:21:53,426 --> 00:21:56,556
into more detail on exactly

435
00:21:57,576 --> 00:22:01,086
So that's Focus Interaction

436
00:21:57,576 --> 00:22:01,086
So that's Focus Interaction

437
00:22:01,526 --> 00:22:06,546
And that concludes our overview

438
00:22:06,546 --> 00:22:10,136
And so for the next part of our

439
00:22:10,216 --> 00:22:11,486
with a case study on how

440
00:22:11,486 --> 00:22:13,926
to build a fully custom,

441
00:22:15,236 --> 00:22:16,306
And for our example today,

442
00:22:16,306 --> 00:22:19,106
we're going to use a

443
00:22:20,716 --> 00:22:23,856
Now we've already done some work

444
00:22:23,856 --> 00:22:27,076
of this control and I'd

445
00:22:27,156 --> 00:22:31,206
We just used the normal UIButton

446
00:22:31,466 --> 00:22:32,666
as the title of the button.

447
00:22:32,896 --> 00:22:35,536
If you select the button,

448
00:22:35,536 --> 00:22:36,776
and if you keep selecting

449
00:22:36,776 --> 00:22:38,656
it'll cycle through all

450
00:22:39,166 --> 00:22:42,206
Now this is okay.

451
00:22:43,266 --> 00:22:46,636
It gives us the functionality

452
00:22:46,636 --> 00:22:47,896
to take our app to

453
00:22:48,096 --> 00:22:51,126
And this control, it's

454
00:22:51,126 --> 00:22:52,786
It's not very interactive.

455
00:22:53,426 --> 00:22:56,096
And so we thought long and

456
00:22:56,096 --> 00:22:58,846
up with a new design and

457
00:22:59,976 --> 00:23:02,246
That's a lot better.

458
00:22:59,976 --> 00:23:02,246
That's a lot better.

459
00:23:02,596 --> 00:23:04,656
Instead of just saying

460
00:23:04,866 --> 00:23:07,836
we now visually indicate our

461
00:23:08,376 --> 00:23:10,976
When you select the control,

462
00:23:10,976 --> 00:23:12,666
where you can use

463
00:23:13,246 --> 00:23:15,696
to change our rating

464
00:23:15,696 --> 00:23:17,766
And when we're done, we

465
00:23:17,836 --> 00:23:19,706
and we exit editing mode.

466
00:23:20,306 --> 00:23:22,996
This is a great example of

467
00:23:22,996 --> 00:23:25,066
for focus interaction and

468
00:23:25,066 --> 00:23:27,016
through building this

469
00:23:27,016 --> 00:23:28,706
from scratch using

470
00:23:29,416 --> 00:23:31,486
And for that, I'm going to hand

471
00:23:32,516 --> 00:23:35,500
[ Applause ]

472
00:23:42,496 --> 00:23:44,556
All right, thanks, Matt.

473
00:23:44,696 --> 00:23:46,646
So I have a project here

474
00:23:47,106 --> 00:23:50,436
which contains our simple button

475
00:23:50,796 --> 00:23:52,326
as nice as the one

476
00:23:52,416 --> 00:23:53,396
So let's just delete that.

477
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:56,156
Let's go ahead and

478
00:23:56,956 --> 00:23:59,896
to represent our new control.

479
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:04,216
We'll set up some constraints

480
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:04,216
We'll set up some constraints

481
00:24:04,216 --> 00:24:07,956
from the top, a width

482
00:24:09,576 --> 00:24:14,246
and we'll center it

483
00:24:14,466 --> 00:24:17,726
Great. Now I've already

484
00:24:17,836 --> 00:24:20,046
to represent this

485
00:24:20,046 --> 00:24:21,136
that as a views class.

486
00:24:21,946 --> 00:24:25,926
And let's go check out

487
00:24:27,856 --> 00:24:29,816
We chose a subclass

488
00:24:29,816 --> 00:24:32,306
because it provides a lot of

489
00:24:32,306 --> 00:24:35,836
For example, it determines if

490
00:24:35,836 --> 00:24:39,206
or not based on its

491
00:24:39,336 --> 00:24:41,686
it doesn't have a

492
00:24:41,686 --> 00:24:42,986
We have to provide

493
00:24:42,986 --> 00:24:45,846
So let's go do that.

494
00:24:45,986 --> 00:24:48,696
We'll start by adding a corner

495
00:24:49,356 --> 00:24:52,836
and then we'll override

496
00:24:52,836 --> 00:24:54,996
with coordinator to

497
00:24:54,996 --> 00:24:55,986
and unfocused appearance.

498
00:24:55,986 --> 00:24:59,476
So if the next focus

499
00:24:59,476 --> 00:25:02,426
then we'll configure the focus

500
00:24:59,476 --> 00:25:02,426
then we'll configure the focus

501
00:25:02,426 --> 00:25:04,366
of scaling the view,

502
00:25:04,366 --> 00:25:05,816
and changing the

503
00:25:06,846 --> 00:25:09,166
If the previously focused

504
00:25:09,596 --> 00:25:12,006
then we'll configure the

505
00:25:12,466 --> 00:25:14,276
which just rests all

506
00:25:14,976 --> 00:25:16,386
Now before I run this,

507
00:25:16,626 --> 00:25:18,626
I also want to add motion

508
00:25:19,286 --> 00:25:22,076
Motion effects makes your

509
00:25:22,386 --> 00:25:24,906
and helps the user find

510
00:25:25,546 --> 00:25:28,646
So to do that, I'll

511
00:25:28,646 --> 00:25:31,956
to add horizontal and vertical

512
00:25:31,956 --> 00:25:32,866
around the touch surface.

513
00:25:34,166 --> 00:25:36,836
Now I need to go back, and when

514
00:25:37,596 --> 00:25:41,116
I will add the motion effect,

515
00:25:41,226 --> 00:25:43,216
I will remove the motion effect.

516
00:25:43,966 --> 00:25:45,156
Now I make all these changes

517
00:25:45,196 --> 00:25:47,466
within addCoordinatedAnimations

518
00:25:47,816 --> 00:25:51,206
This way, our property

519
00:25:51,206 --> 00:25:52,516
with our focus animations.

520
00:25:52,516 --> 00:25:54,976
So let's see how this looks.

521
00:26:04,186 --> 00:26:07,126
All right, so what we've done

522
00:26:07,126 --> 00:26:10,576
so far is create a very basic

523
00:26:10,576 --> 00:26:13,266
and unfocused appearance

524
00:26:13,266 --> 00:26:15,526
So it moves when I move my

525
00:26:16,376 --> 00:26:18,936
But this is supposed to be

526
00:26:18,936 --> 00:26:20,336
and we don't have any stars yet.

527
00:26:20,936 --> 00:26:25,326
So let's go add those.

528
00:26:25,556 --> 00:26:27,186
So first we need to

529
00:26:27,296 --> 00:26:28,406
to store our control state.

530
00:26:29,476 --> 00:26:31,466
And then in our awakeFromNib

531
00:26:33,196 --> 00:26:37,616
we'll add a horizontal stackView

532
00:26:37,616 --> 00:26:41,356
I've already created the star

533
00:26:41,396 --> 00:26:42,506
but if you're following along,

534
00:26:42,506 --> 00:26:45,126
I configured their focus

535
00:26:45,126 --> 00:26:46,366
process that we just saw.

536
00:26:46,366 --> 00:26:50,596
Now when the user selects the

537
00:26:50,596 --> 00:26:51,666
to edit the current rating.

538
00:26:52,376 --> 00:26:54,546
So I'll add a

539
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:55,876
to our control.

540
00:26:55,876 --> 00:26:59,226
And when that's triggered,

541
00:26:59,226 --> 00:27:00,426
and request a focus update.

542
00:26:59,226 --> 00:27:00,426
and request a focus update.

543
00:27:01,686 --> 00:27:02,956
When a focus update happens,

544
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:04,796
it consults our

545
00:27:05,016 --> 00:27:06,286
So we'll override that property.

546
00:27:06,696 --> 00:27:09,986
And if we're editing,

547
00:27:09,986 --> 00:27:11,486
as our

548
00:27:12,276 --> 00:27:14,706
Otherwise, we'll just return

549
00:27:14,706 --> 00:27:17,566
Let's run this, see

550
00:27:22,326 --> 00:27:26,876
Okay, so this time

551
00:27:26,876 --> 00:27:29,516
we have some stars

552
00:27:29,516 --> 00:27:32,406
And when I select the control,

553
00:27:32,406 --> 00:27:35,296
within the control; however,

554
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:37,466
to move focus to

555
00:27:38,296 --> 00:27:40,686
This is because there's some

556
00:27:40,686 --> 00:27:43,636
So when we try to move focus

557
00:27:43,636 --> 00:27:46,626
up focusing on our control,

558
00:27:46,626 --> 00:27:49,106
to our first star using

559
00:27:49,636 --> 00:27:52,916
So to fix this, we want to

560
00:27:52,916 --> 00:27:54,546
focusable when we're editing.

561
00:27:55,146 --> 00:27:58,416
So let's override

562
00:27:58,486 --> 00:28:02,126
and we'll return false if our

563
00:27:58,486 --> 00:28:02,126
and we'll return false if our

564
00:28:02,126 --> 00:28:05,946
So let's run this, see

565
00:28:11,516 --> 00:28:13,006
All right, that's much better.

566
00:28:13,316 --> 00:28:15,426
So now I'll able to move

567
00:28:16,436 --> 00:28:19,526
But it's difficult to tell

568
00:28:19,526 --> 00:28:21,536
because we don't provide

569
00:28:22,126 --> 00:28:25,226
So to do that, we need to

570
00:28:25,226 --> 00:28:26,516
when our focus changes.

571
00:28:27,466 --> 00:28:30,986
So let's go back to our

572
00:28:31,726 --> 00:28:33,776
and at the bottom,

573
00:28:34,486 --> 00:28:36,476
we'll set the current

574
00:28:36,696 --> 00:28:38,166
of the currently

575
00:28:38,616 --> 00:28:42,376
And let's go back up to

576
00:28:42,956 --> 00:28:46,466
and we'll tie that directly

577
00:28:46,466 --> 00:28:48,896
to the isSelected

578
00:28:49,156 --> 00:28:51,866
And this property just sets the

579
00:28:51,866 --> 00:28:53,976
So let's see how that looks.

580
00:29:02,096 --> 00:29:07,076
Okay, so now when I select

581
00:29:07,076 --> 00:29:08,146
that the first star is selected.

582
00:29:08,146 --> 00:29:11,926
And when I move focus, all the

583
00:29:12,006 --> 00:29:14,056
So it's easy to tell what

584
00:29:15,066 --> 00:29:17,226
So this is pretty good

585
00:29:18,346 --> 00:29:20,776
Right now I'm able to move

586
00:29:21,606 --> 00:29:22,686
and I don't want

587
00:29:22,686 --> 00:29:24,496
that when I'm editing

588
00:29:25,446 --> 00:29:27,646
Also, when I select the control,

589
00:29:27,886 --> 00:29:30,266
we always reset the current

590
00:29:30,266 --> 00:29:32,946
I think it would be better

591
00:29:32,946 --> 00:29:35,046
and just focused on

592
00:29:35,796 --> 00:29:37,416
So let's go make those changes.

593
00:29:40,436 --> 00:29:44,616
So we'll start by overriding

594
00:29:44,716 --> 00:29:45,936
to restrict focus movement.

595
00:29:46,626 --> 00:29:50,266
So if we're editing and the

596
00:29:50,266 --> 00:29:52,386
of our star views,

597
00:29:52,386 --> 00:29:56,156
to say no, focus can't move.

598
00:29:56,386 --> 00:29:59,476
Also, in our

599
00:29:59,476 --> 00:30:05,336
we want to return our last

600
00:29:59,476 --> 00:30:05,336
we want to return our last

601
00:30:05,336 --> 00:30:07,326
and the current rating

602
00:30:07,906 --> 00:30:09,916
So this way we don't reset

603
00:30:11,636 --> 00:30:12,956
Let's run this one more

604
00:30:20,716 --> 00:30:22,606
Okay, now I'm no longer able

605
00:30:22,606 --> 00:30:24,656
to move focus outside

606
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:28,336
And when I select a control, the

607
00:30:28,716 --> 00:30:30,686
and we just focus on

608
00:30:31,816 --> 00:30:33,706
So that completes

609
00:30:34,006 --> 00:30:36,606
By utilizing the Focus

610
00:30:36,606 --> 00:30:39,116
to create a pretty complex

611
00:30:39,656 --> 00:30:41,836
Now I'd like to invite

612
00:30:42,516 --> 00:30:47,676
[ Applause ]

613
00:30:48,176 --> 00:30:48,776
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Brandon.

614
00:30:49,436 --> 00:30:51,476
I rate that demo

615
00:30:54,226 --> 00:30:58,966
Okay, we chose that demo

616
00:30:58,966 --> 00:31:02,096
of using many different parts

617
00:30:58,966 --> 00:31:02,096
of using many different parts

618
00:31:02,096 --> 00:31:05,126
to create a rich focus

619
00:31:06,006 --> 00:31:09,116
And there are just a couple

620
00:31:09,216 --> 00:31:11,746
that Brandon showed us that

621
00:31:11,746 --> 00:31:12,926
because they're important

622
00:31:12,926 --> 00:31:15,036
for really creating a

623
00:31:16,096 --> 00:31:19,316
The first tip we have is

624
00:31:19,866 --> 00:31:23,436
UIControl provides a lot of

625
00:31:23,786 --> 00:31:26,646
for instance, as Brandon said,

626
00:31:26,646 --> 00:31:29,756
of your controls based on

627
00:31:31,096 --> 00:31:33,196
So when you're building

628
00:31:34,296 --> 00:31:36,276
you should also subclass

629
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:41,846
We also used the focus

630
00:31:41,846 --> 00:31:45,276
to define our focus-related

631
00:31:45,276 --> 00:31:46,976
when changing our focus state.

632
00:31:48,026 --> 00:31:50,296
This is also really

633
00:31:50,296 --> 00:31:52,166
that our focus animations

634
00:31:52,436 --> 00:31:54,966
with other focus animations

635
00:31:54,966 --> 00:31:55,926
of the user interface.

636
00:31:56,326 --> 00:31:59,706
And we do this to make sure

637
00:31:59,706 --> 00:32:01,926
around the screen when

638
00:31:59,706 --> 00:32:01,926
around the screen when

639
00:32:01,926 --> 00:32:03,096
between different controls.

640
00:32:03,546 --> 00:32:05,476
So when you're defining

641
00:32:05,476 --> 00:32:06,786
for your focus appearance,

642
00:32:07,136 --> 00:32:09,636
please use the focus

643
00:32:10,206 --> 00:32:14,746
And the last tip is

644
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:17,056
Brandon showed us how

645
00:32:17,476 --> 00:32:19,406
to create a little

646
00:32:19,566 --> 00:32:23,816
when you place your thumb on the

647
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:25,896
of movement but not enough

648
00:32:27,496 --> 00:32:29,456
You can use the UIMotionEffect's

649
00:32:29,836 --> 00:32:32,136
to implement this

650
00:32:33,226 --> 00:32:36,046
This is important because

651
00:32:36,046 --> 00:32:38,056
to get this direct

652
00:32:38,336 --> 00:32:40,686
so that they get

653
00:32:40,686 --> 00:32:42,436
as they start using

654
00:32:43,246 --> 00:32:46,076
It also helps the user

655
00:32:46,076 --> 00:32:48,036
so that they can sit down

656
00:32:48,396 --> 00:32:49,816
wiggle the remote around,

657
00:32:50,206 --> 00:32:53,006
and immediately the

658
00:32:54,276 --> 00:32:57,206
Before we wrap us, just

659
00:32:57,996 --> 00:33:03,046
The first is to point out that

660
00:32:57,996 --> 00:33:03,046
The first is to point out that

661
00:33:03,046 --> 00:33:04,256
same capabilities.

662
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:06,286
And this is definitely

663
00:33:06,286 --> 00:33:07,796
to testing your custom controls.

664
00:33:08,336 --> 00:33:11,746
Now the good news is that

665
00:33:12,196 --> 00:33:15,076
to build your custom controls,

666
00:33:15,416 --> 00:33:18,346
then your control should work

667
00:33:18,346 --> 00:33:20,456
that we talked about

668
00:33:20,456 --> 00:33:25,536
Bluetooth keyboards, the Siri

669
00:33:25,696 --> 00:33:28,836
But not all these input devices

670
00:33:29,056 --> 00:33:31,126
so that if your custom

671
00:33:31,226 --> 00:33:34,526
on some custom event handling

672
00:33:34,526 --> 00:33:36,496
for example, let's say

673
00:33:36,756 --> 00:33:40,176
for example you're

674
00:33:40,176 --> 00:33:42,866
which generates touch events

675
00:33:43,346 --> 00:33:46,526
and you're using that

676
00:33:46,526 --> 00:33:47,686
within your custom control,

677
00:33:48,176 --> 00:33:50,316
well if a user is using

678
00:33:50,436 --> 00:33:52,106
they can't generate

679
00:33:52,466 --> 00:33:55,016
And so you'll have to do

680
00:33:55,016 --> 00:33:58,216
that your control can behave

681
00:33:58,486 --> 00:34:00,686
for all users, in

682
00:33:58,486 --> 00:34:00,686
for all users, in

683
00:34:01,226 --> 00:34:03,606
And so definitely

684
00:34:03,606 --> 00:34:08,116
that use custom event handling

685
00:34:08,356 --> 00:34:11,186
Try out a Bluetooth keyboard,

686
00:34:11,636 --> 00:34:14,315
very important to maintaining

687
00:34:15,516 --> 00:34:18,696
And finally, please,

688
00:34:18,696 --> 00:34:19,636
with accessibility.

689
00:34:19,886 --> 00:34:23,295
The good news here is that the

690
00:34:23,295 --> 00:34:23,956
work for you.

691
00:34:24,106 --> 00:34:28,606
For example, if the user wants

692
00:34:29,036 --> 00:34:31,886
the Focus engine will

693
00:34:32,176 --> 00:34:34,545
around the currently focused

694
00:34:34,545 --> 00:34:36,856
out on the screen and

695
00:34:37,936 --> 00:34:40,815
But for other accessibility

696
00:34:41,216 --> 00:34:43,735
you're going to have the do

697
00:34:43,735 --> 00:34:45,676
that you're used to

698
00:34:45,676 --> 00:34:47,906
that your controls

699
00:34:49,016 --> 00:34:53,235
And so please test your controls

700
00:34:53,636 --> 00:34:56,815
to make sure that they behavior

701
00:34:57,986 --> 00:35:01,336
So that's our talk today.

702
00:34:57,986 --> 00:35:01,336
So that's our talk today.

703
00:35:01,656 --> 00:35:03,626
We introduced two

704
00:35:03,626 --> 00:35:07,156
preferredFocusEnvironments and

705
00:35:07,476 --> 00:35:10,316
to help manage preferred

706
00:35:10,466 --> 00:35:12,936
We also announced the new

707
00:35:13,026 --> 00:35:16,516
for SpriteKit and we think this

708
00:35:16,516 --> 00:35:18,106
complexity of your

709
00:35:18,106 --> 00:35:21,756
And finally, we took you through

710
00:35:21,756 --> 00:35:25,036
to build a custom focusable

711
00:35:25,036 --> 00:35:25,746
rating control.

712
00:35:26,676 --> 00:35:28,236
Now before we leave today,

713
00:35:28,706 --> 00:35:30,716
we'd like to mention some

714
00:35:30,756 --> 00:35:31,666
to help you learn more.

715
00:35:33,006 --> 00:35:34,516
Specifically, you

716
00:35:34,516 --> 00:35:36,806
out the Apple TV

717
00:35:37,566 --> 00:35:39,976
These cover -- these are

718
00:35:39,976 --> 00:35:43,586
They cover a wide array

719
00:35:43,586 --> 00:35:46,296
for people getting new to

720
00:35:46,296 --> 00:35:48,976
if you've had some experience

721
00:35:49,846 --> 00:35:53,356
Specifically, there's one

722
00:35:53,356 --> 00:35:56,256
with UIKit that goes

723
00:35:56,256 --> 00:35:58,216
of the more basic

724
00:35:58,976 --> 00:36:02,416
some of the basic concepts,

725
00:35:58,976 --> 00:36:02,416
some of the basic concepts,

726
00:36:02,416 --> 00:36:04,306
of the parts of the API

727
00:36:05,166 --> 00:36:07,716
It talks about some best

728
00:36:07,716 --> 00:36:10,326
and debugging support, which

729
00:36:10,326 --> 00:36:11,246
with building your apps.

730
00:36:11,856 --> 00:36:14,096
You can find these

731
00:36:14,496 --> 00:36:17,996
And for more information

732
00:36:18,526 --> 00:36:20,756
you can go to this URL to

733
00:36:20,826 --> 00:36:23,266
There are some other

734
00:36:23,266 --> 00:36:24,186
that you should check out.

735
00:36:24,716 --> 00:36:26,916
If you're building games

736
00:36:26,916 --> 00:36:29,726
to the What's New in SpriteKit

737
00:36:29,726 --> 00:36:32,676
about how to specifically

738
00:36:32,776 --> 00:36:36,836
for focus support and then also

739
00:36:36,836 --> 00:36:39,096
in Mastering UIKit

740
00:36:39,426 --> 00:36:41,586
to really take your UIKit

741
00:36:42,336 --> 00:36:43,866
And of course, have

742
00:36:43,996 --> 00:36:44,736
Thank you for coming today.
