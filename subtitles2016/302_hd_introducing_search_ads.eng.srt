00:00:21,116 --> 00:00:22,486
&gt;&gt; Hello and welcome.

3
00:00:23,076 --> 00:00:24,996
I'm Lindsay Verity,

4
00:00:24,996 --> 00:00:27,386
by my colleagues Casey

5
00:00:28,366 --> 00:00:30,506
We're here to introduce

6
00:00:30,506 --> 00:00:36,086
to help people discover

7
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:40,156
If you've developed an app for

8
00:00:40,156 --> 00:00:44,136
effort and passion goes into

9
00:00:44,136 --> 00:00:45,796
and wonderful apps

10
00:00:46,626 --> 00:00:49,406
Just like this year's

11
00:00:50,326 --> 00:00:53,196
You also know that putting

12
00:00:53,196 --> 00:00:55,806
and discoverability

13
00:00:55,806 --> 00:00:56,876
as crucial to its success.

14
00:00:57,846 --> 00:00:59,876
And that's what we're here

15
00:01:00,436 --> 00:01:01,396
But before we do that,

16
00:01:01,396 --> 00:01:04,226
let's review all the ways a user

17
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:05,056
in the App Store.

18
00:01:06,036 --> 00:01:09,836
There's featured app collections

19
00:01:09,906 --> 00:01:13,866
that showcase the best apps

20
00:01:14,056 --> 00:01:16,966
and seasonal or cultural events.

21
00:01:18,616 --> 00:01:20,806
Categories where

22
00:01:20,806 --> 00:01:23,066
and explore apps

23
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:28,986
Top Charts, which list the

24
00:01:28,986 --> 00:01:32,556
or most downloaded apps and

25
00:01:32,906 --> 00:01:34,526
free, and top-grossing.

26
00:01:35,466 --> 00:01:39,686
And whilst editorial

27
00:01:39,686 --> 00:01:42,166
to get a quick burst of

28
00:01:42,166 --> 00:01:45,056
by users with over a

29
00:01:45,226 --> 00:01:48,376
in the U.S. App Store, the most

30
00:01:48,376 --> 00:01:50,976
for your app as if it shows up

31
00:01:54,676 --> 00:01:56,826
Now the best way to

32
00:01:56,826 --> 00:01:59,006
and the likelihood a user

33
00:01:59,006 --> 00:02:01,876
in App Store Search, is

34
00:01:59,006 --> 00:02:01,876
in App Store Search, is

35
00:02:01,876 --> 00:02:03,136
for your product page.

36
00:02:03,726 --> 00:02:09,866
And show your app name,

37
00:02:09,866 --> 00:02:12,546
and keywords are highly

38
00:02:13,496 --> 00:02:15,866
This should be the prime

39
00:02:15,866 --> 00:02:22,556
to support your app's

40
00:02:23,136 --> 00:02:27,096
Last week, we announced Search

41
00:02:27,096 --> 00:02:29,436
to control the visibility

42
00:02:29,546 --> 00:02:30,986
in App Store search results.

43
00:02:32,306 --> 00:02:34,646
Search Ads can help develop

44
00:02:34,646 --> 00:02:38,956
and increase usage

45
00:02:40,426 --> 00:02:43,746
Almost two-thirds of all

46
00:02:43,806 --> 00:02:45,046
from searches on the App Store.

47
00:02:46,146 --> 00:02:49,676
The App Store is the place where

48
00:02:49,676 --> 00:02:52,586
for an app to download,

49
00:02:52,586 --> 00:02:56,366
to invest in the

50
00:02:58,296 --> 00:03:00,356
When a user searches

51
00:02:58,296 --> 00:03:00,356
When a user searches

52
00:03:00,706 --> 00:03:03,566
a single sponsored ad

53
00:03:03,716 --> 00:03:04,766
of the search results.

54
00:03:05,916 --> 00:03:08,236
The sponsored listing will

55
00:03:08,486 --> 00:03:10,716
and ad icon next to

56
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:14,826
The app may be in one of

57
00:03:15,576 --> 00:03:17,766
optimized to what

58
00:03:17,766 --> 00:03:22,006
for that search query and user.

59
00:03:23,186 --> 00:03:25,976
Because user experience

60
00:03:26,676 --> 00:03:29,646
relevance is the main factor

61
00:03:29,646 --> 00:03:30,846
be showed for search query.

62
00:03:31,736 --> 00:03:34,336
If your app is not relevant to

63
00:03:34,596 --> 00:03:36,996
it will not appear in

64
00:03:36,996 --> 00:03:38,576
of how much you may

65
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:40,986
Let me give you an example.

66
00:03:41,126 --> 00:03:46,426
You have a pizza delivery app

67
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:49,316
because you think those

68
00:03:49,316 --> 00:03:51,026
engrossed to actually

69
00:03:52,126 --> 00:03:55,156
Well, your app most likely will

70
00:03:55,156 --> 00:03:59,766
for those searches because

71
00:04:00,086 --> 00:04:05,256
Now relevance will be determined

72
00:04:05,256 --> 00:04:06,986
of your App Store metadata.

73
00:04:06,986 --> 00:04:10,216
So as I mentioned earlier,

74
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:13,536
in thoughtfully crafting

75
00:04:13,536 --> 00:04:17,046
and metadata with the most

76
00:04:17,046 --> 00:04:18,555
improve your organic presence,

77
00:04:18,866 --> 00:04:20,685
it will also improve

78
00:04:20,685 --> 00:04:23,776
for sponsored ads as well.

79
00:04:24,796 --> 00:04:27,276
We also take users'

80
00:04:27,276 --> 00:04:28,636
as a signal for its relevance.

81
00:04:29,556 --> 00:04:36,736
If users don't respond to an ad,

82
00:04:37,526 --> 00:04:39,776
Pricing is a Cost Per Tap model.

83
00:04:39,856 --> 00:04:42,646
So you only pay when a

84
00:04:42,956 --> 00:04:45,256
and you decide the maximum

85
00:04:45,256 --> 00:04:46,046
to pay for a tap.

86
00:04:47,406 --> 00:04:51,036
The actual cost of

87
00:04:51,036 --> 00:04:52,406
of a Second Price Auction,

88
00:04:52,406 --> 00:04:54,646
meaning the price

89
00:04:54,646 --> 00:04:57,096
on what your nearest

90
00:04:57,096 --> 00:04:59,776
to show their ad up

91
00:05:00,616 --> 00:05:02,956
This means you'll never pay more

92
00:05:03,456 --> 00:05:06,466
or more than you need to.

93
00:05:07,576 --> 00:05:10,766
And whether your ad will

94
00:05:10,766 --> 00:05:14,066
of your app's relevance to the

95
00:05:14,066 --> 00:05:15,226
of your bid comparative

96
00:05:15,226 --> 00:05:16,996
to others bidding

97
00:05:18,006 --> 00:05:19,406
And as I said earlier, apps

98
00:05:19,546 --> 00:05:22,686
that aren't relevant won't

99
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:31,616
With App Store Search being the

100
00:05:31,616 --> 00:05:34,506
of app downloads, our goal

101
00:05:34,766 --> 00:05:37,166
to give all developers

102
00:05:37,196 --> 00:05:40,916
to reach more customers through

103
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:42,146
in relevant search results.

104
00:05:42,606 --> 00:05:44,966
Whether you have a

105
00:05:45,446 --> 00:05:47,656
have marketing expertise

106
00:05:48,856 --> 00:05:50,586
I now invite Casey

107
00:05:50,586 --> 00:05:52,056
about the features

108
00:05:52,056 --> 00:05:56,066
into the product

109
00:05:56,276 --> 00:05:58,746
&gt;&gt; We've worked hard to make

110
00:05:58,746 --> 00:05:59,716
for all developers.

111
00:05:59,716 --> 00:06:02,376
But we really thought a lot

112
00:05:59,716 --> 00:06:02,376
But we really thought a lot

113
00:06:02,376 --> 00:06:04,526
for smaller developers

114
00:06:04,526 --> 00:06:05,666
and as simple as possible.

115
00:06:06,216 --> 00:06:08,516
So that way you can get back

116
00:06:08,516 --> 00:06:09,916
which is creating great apps.

117
00:06:10,576 --> 00:06:13,666
Search Ads was designed

118
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:15,486
so that you can get

119
00:06:15,486 --> 00:06:16,506
in a matter of minutes.

120
00:06:17,306 --> 00:06:19,806
And there are only a

121
00:06:19,806 --> 00:06:22,006
to tell us before you can

122
00:06:22,546 --> 00:06:24,526
And that is, your

123
00:06:24,826 --> 00:06:25,946
and your payment information.

124
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:27,206
And that's it.

125
00:06:27,396 --> 00:06:29,596
So let's talk about

126
00:06:30,136 --> 00:06:32,836
You tell us the app that

127
00:06:33,096 --> 00:06:35,456
and Search Ads will

128
00:06:35,456 --> 00:06:37,956
for you using the

129
00:06:37,956 --> 00:06:40,266
that you've already provided

130
00:06:40,716 --> 00:06:44,136
So there's actually nothing for

131
00:06:44,136 --> 00:06:47,006
that your App Store information

132
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:48,166
of your app.

133
00:06:48,856 --> 00:06:52,156
Now because we know so much

134
00:06:52,366 --> 00:06:55,436
we can then take that ad and

135
00:06:55,436 --> 00:06:56,726
that are coming through

136
00:06:57,036 --> 00:06:59,826
We do this with our default

137
00:07:00,146 --> 00:07:01,976
and we absolutely

138
00:07:02,236 --> 00:07:05,316
We really think that

139
00:07:05,566 --> 00:07:06,986
Next you'll define your budget.

140
00:07:07,586 --> 00:07:09,916
Your budget can include

141
00:07:10,306 --> 00:07:13,116
You'll also tell us the maximum

142
00:07:13,116 --> 00:07:14,516
to pay for a tap on your ad.

143
00:07:15,216 --> 00:07:19,256
Eric will talk about how to best

144
00:07:19,256 --> 00:07:20,186
on in the presentation.

145
00:07:21,576 --> 00:07:23,776
Finally, you add your

146
00:07:24,596 --> 00:07:27,366
We support all of the currencies

147
00:07:27,796 --> 00:07:29,516
and except all major

148
00:07:29,966 --> 00:07:32,166
And that's it.

149
00:07:32,736 --> 00:07:34,776
Your ad is now eligible

150
00:07:34,776 --> 00:07:36,056
in App Store Search results.

151
00:07:36,526 --> 00:07:37,356
That's pretty simple.

152
00:07:38,806 --> 00:07:42,676
Now we realize there are some of

153
00:07:42,676 --> 00:07:43,936
when it comes to

154
00:07:44,036 --> 00:07:46,396
and you may want more

155
00:07:46,756 --> 00:07:49,346
Now whether that be choosing

156
00:07:49,346 --> 00:07:52,176
that you want your ad to show

157
00:07:52,176 --> 00:07:54,766
for those keywords, or

158
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:56,366
about a particular

159
00:07:56,366 --> 00:07:57,196
to reach with your ad.

160
00:07:58,056 --> 00:07:59,126
Well, you can do all that.

161
00:07:59,216 --> 00:08:00,816
Let's talk about keywords first.

162
00:07:59,216 --> 00:08:00,816
Let's talk about keywords first.

163
00:08:01,596 --> 00:08:05,286
Now because we know so much

164
00:08:05,676 --> 00:08:08,406
we can provide a list of

165
00:08:08,646 --> 00:08:11,326
so that you don't have to think

166
00:08:12,356 --> 00:08:15,396
Furthermore, you can add

167
00:08:15,686 --> 00:08:20,426
and we'll give you a list of

168
00:08:21,816 --> 00:08:23,106
For all of our keywords,

169
00:08:23,106 --> 00:08:26,866
we offer what we call a relative

170
00:08:27,116 --> 00:08:28,746
And this just give

171
00:08:28,746 --> 00:08:31,896
of how important a particular

172
00:08:32,236 --> 00:08:36,746
but also the relative

173
00:08:36,936 --> 00:08:39,035
We have two match

174
00:08:40,155 --> 00:08:43,015
There's Broad match, which

175
00:08:43,015 --> 00:08:47,076
as well as its relative variance

176
00:08:47,076 --> 00:08:48,166
that include that keyword.

177
00:08:48,256 --> 00:08:51,286
And then there's Exact

178
00:08:51,286 --> 00:08:54,266
that specific phrase as

179
00:08:54,266 --> 00:08:56,486
like common misspellings

180
00:08:56,956 --> 00:08:59,226
If you want to learn

181
00:08:59,226 --> 00:09:00,236
you should come talk to us

182
00:08:59,226 --> 00:09:00,236
you should come talk to us

183
00:09:00,236 --> 00:09:02,706
in our lab session tomorrow

184
00:09:02,706 --> 00:09:04,126
about how these work

185
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:07,476
Now you can keep

186
00:09:07,476 --> 00:09:10,786
And you could set a default bid

187
00:09:11,146 --> 00:09:14,216
or you can apply individual

188
00:09:14,376 --> 00:09:16,236
and that would be if you

189
00:09:16,236 --> 00:09:18,816
that keyword based on

190
00:09:19,066 --> 00:09:22,086
or just how important that

191
00:09:23,556 --> 00:09:26,526
There are also additional

192
00:09:26,526 --> 00:09:28,976
to you if appropriate

193
00:09:29,426 --> 00:09:32,506
Now our default setting is

194
00:09:32,506 --> 00:09:34,256
that have already

195
00:09:34,586 --> 00:09:37,536
That way your budget can focus

196
00:09:38,376 --> 00:09:40,856
However, if your campaign

197
00:09:41,396 --> 00:09:46,286
you can target existing users as

198
00:09:46,546 --> 00:09:49,226
If you want to further refine

199
00:09:49,226 --> 00:09:52,436
to target by things like gender,

200
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:56,426
So a very simple way to use

201
00:09:56,426 --> 00:09:59,466
that you have an app that

202
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:02,976
Well, you could target

203
00:10:03,146 --> 00:10:05,776
and that way you wouldn't

204
00:10:05,776 --> 00:10:06,966
that your app doesn't service.

205
00:10:08,426 --> 00:10:10,506
Or perhaps there's an

206
00:10:10,506 --> 00:10:12,806
that you know is your

207
00:10:13,576 --> 00:10:16,116
Let's say males, ages 18 to 34.

208
00:10:16,506 --> 00:10:18,506
Well, you could create

209
00:10:18,566 --> 00:10:21,286
that would allow you to closely

210
00:10:21,286 --> 00:10:22,666
then, for that audience.

211
00:10:23,286 --> 00:10:28,536
Now we obviously want you

212
00:10:28,536 --> 00:10:29,916
on investment in Search Ads.

213
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:33,356
But we want that to be a very

214
00:10:33,856 --> 00:10:37,216
So we designed an

215
00:10:37,216 --> 00:10:40,446
and reporting UI that will allow

216
00:10:40,446 --> 00:10:42,886
of what's happening,

217
00:10:42,886 --> 00:10:44,976
down into the details

218
00:10:44,976 --> 00:10:47,766
Now the best place to

219
00:10:47,766 --> 00:10:48,896
of performance is

220
00:10:48,896 --> 00:10:51,586
on the campaign overview

221
00:10:51,696 --> 00:10:54,886
And this is where we've trended

222
00:10:55,126 --> 00:10:57,046
in one very easy to digest page.

223
00:10:58,026 --> 00:11:00,676
From here, you could hop

224
00:10:58,026 --> 00:11:00,676
From here, you could hop

225
00:11:00,846 --> 00:11:02,686
And you'll see we've

226
00:11:02,686 --> 00:11:03,966
to optimize those keywords

227
00:11:04,216 --> 00:11:05,756
because we've placed

228
00:11:05,756 --> 00:11:07,736
in the exact same place

229
00:11:08,596 --> 00:11:11,436
If you have bulk sets of

230
00:11:11,436 --> 00:11:13,496
which would be the keywords

231
00:11:13,496 --> 00:11:16,366
to show against, you can upload

232
00:11:16,366 --> 00:11:16,706
as well.

233
00:11:17,646 --> 00:11:19,206
Then there's the

234
00:11:19,206 --> 00:11:21,376
And this is a very powerful tab.

235
00:11:21,506 --> 00:11:24,616
You could learn the actual

236
00:11:24,616 --> 00:11:27,076
to an impression, tap,

237
00:11:27,276 --> 00:11:28,416
So all the search queries

238
00:11:28,416 --> 00:11:30,266
that your ad's been

239
00:11:30,626 --> 00:11:32,926
So anything from that Search

240
00:11:32,926 --> 00:11:35,026
about earlier will be

241
00:11:35,066 --> 00:11:37,516
And you'd also see search

242
00:11:37,516 --> 00:11:39,316
from your own Broad

243
00:11:39,766 --> 00:11:42,596
So really it's just a great

244
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:48,626
Now these management screens

245
00:11:48,626 --> 00:11:49,996
with performance

246
00:11:50,506 --> 00:11:53,246
But we've also built a

247
00:11:53,516 --> 00:11:55,976
that allows you to parse

248
00:11:55,976 --> 00:11:58,326
and keywords by things

249
00:11:58,386 --> 00:12:00,096
location, device, and more.

250
00:11:58,386 --> 00:12:00,096
location, device, and more.

251
00:12:01,316 --> 00:12:03,696
You can download all of

252
00:12:03,726 --> 00:12:06,406
and we also offer

253
00:12:06,406 --> 00:12:08,226
campaign creation,

254
00:12:10,106 --> 00:12:11,666
Once you've acquired a customer,

255
00:12:11,946 --> 00:12:14,266
we offer a robust

256
00:12:14,446 --> 00:12:17,146
to give you advance insights,

257
00:12:17,146 --> 00:12:18,456
to understand the keywords

258
00:12:18,616 --> 00:12:20,996
that are delivering the most

259
00:12:21,436 --> 00:12:23,046
That way you can

260
00:12:23,046 --> 00:12:25,116
to optimize your bidding

261
00:12:25,776 --> 00:12:28,016
And now I'd like to invite Eric

262
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:30,386
to show you just how

263
00:12:30,386 --> 00:12:32,246
and optimize a Search

264
00:12:32,426 --> 00:12:34,206
in our simple, yet powerful UI.

265
00:12:38,036 --> 00:12:40,736
&gt;&gt; I'm going to share

266
00:12:40,736 --> 00:12:44,536
and manage a successful search

267
00:12:45,016 --> 00:12:50,496
First, I search for my app

268
00:12:50,496 --> 00:12:54,686
My app is LightRight, a new

269
00:12:54,686 --> 00:12:57,726
in unique filters that aren't

270
00:12:58,496 --> 00:13:02,386
Search Ads has found my app

271
00:12:58,496 --> 00:13:02,386
Search Ads has found my app

272
00:13:02,786 --> 00:13:07,056
which it will use to make my

273
00:13:07,656 --> 00:13:10,996
Straight away I can see it has

274
00:13:11,176 --> 00:13:13,776
for me, and I can

275
00:13:14,856 --> 00:13:17,636
The first thing I need

276
00:13:17,636 --> 00:13:18,726
and put in my budget.

277
00:13:19,456 --> 00:13:21,146
My budget is $3,000.

278
00:13:21,706 --> 00:13:25,706
I also have the option to

279
00:13:26,196 --> 00:13:28,766
I want to pace out my budget

280
00:13:29,066 --> 00:13:30,746
so I'll set it to $50.

281
00:13:34,016 --> 00:13:36,596
Now I need to create

282
00:13:36,766 --> 00:13:39,636
So I can organize my

283
00:13:39,636 --> 00:13:41,416
or audience targeting

284
00:13:41,806 --> 00:13:44,466
I'm going to call mine

285
00:13:48,396 --> 00:13:51,876
Because Search Ads knows

286
00:13:52,366 --> 00:13:55,086
it has defaulted my ads

287
00:13:55,086 --> 00:13:57,746
on both the iPad and the iPhone.

288
00:13:58,306 --> 00:14:02,946
I have the option to

289
00:13:58,306 --> 00:14:02,946
I have the option to

290
00:14:03,586 --> 00:14:05,866
but I want to reach as

291
00:14:05,906 --> 00:14:07,326
so I'll leave it as is.

292
00:14:07,896 --> 00:14:13,626
If appropriate, I can also

293
00:14:13,626 --> 00:14:15,546
and stop on specific dates.

294
00:14:15,696 --> 00:14:19,516
The default setting is to

295
00:14:20,106 --> 00:14:24,906
I can also choose to have my

296
00:14:24,906 --> 00:14:26,666
of the week or times of the day.

297
00:14:27,246 --> 00:14:30,906
But for my LightRight App, I'd

298
00:14:30,906 --> 00:14:33,996
as the App Store, 24/7.

299
00:14:34,906 --> 00:14:38,946
Importantly, I need to set my

300
00:14:39,996 --> 00:14:44,146
To work out how I should

301
00:14:44,336 --> 00:14:47,716
I take what I know an average

302
00:14:47,976 --> 00:14:50,766
and decide how much

303
00:14:50,766 --> 00:14:52,756
on acquiring each new customer.

304
00:14:53,506 --> 00:14:56,986
I can afford to spend

305
00:14:57,866 --> 00:15:01,276
Given that searchers in the

306
00:14:57,866 --> 00:15:01,276
Given that searchers in the

307
00:15:01,276 --> 00:15:05,406
downloaders, I'm going to assume

308
00:15:05,406 --> 00:15:09,896
of the people who tap on my ad

309
00:15:09,996 --> 00:15:14,066
Doing the math, that means I

310
00:15:14,426 --> 00:15:18,366
of $2.50 per tap or $1.

311
00:15:19,756 --> 00:15:23,976
So I'll set my starting

312
00:15:31,046 --> 00:15:33,306
I have the option to

313
00:15:33,306 --> 00:15:34,176
acquisition goal.

314
00:15:34,806 --> 00:15:38,446
Search Ads will use this

315
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:40,126
but it's not a guarantee.

316
00:15:40,946 --> 00:15:44,366
If I set it too low, I

317
00:15:44,366 --> 00:15:45,766
that may lead to downloads.

318
00:15:46,436 --> 00:15:48,806
For now, I'm not

319
00:15:48,806 --> 00:15:50,986
until I have some

320
00:15:51,586 --> 00:15:56,426
Now I'm moving into defining

321
00:15:56,976 --> 00:16:00,106
Search Match is on by default,

322
00:15:56,976 --> 00:16:00,106
Search Match is on by default,

323
00:16:00,106 --> 00:16:01,966
on because as Casey mentioned,

324
00:16:02,296 --> 00:16:05,106
Search Match will

325
00:16:05,266 --> 00:16:07,106
to relevant user searches.

326
00:16:08,006 --> 00:16:11,516
If I want to keep things simple,

327
00:16:11,516 --> 00:16:12,956
to do all of the work for me.

328
00:16:14,176 --> 00:16:16,886
Because as I have time and

329
00:16:16,886 --> 00:16:19,006
with search campaigns, I'm going

330
00:16:19,006 --> 00:16:21,486
to see what keywords are

331
00:16:22,276 --> 00:16:27,546
All of these look good, so I'm

332
00:16:28,176 --> 00:16:30,606
I can also see that some

333
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:33,756
such as picture editor

334
00:16:34,276 --> 00:16:37,936
I'll want to keep a

335
00:16:38,126 --> 00:16:41,326
I also have a few keywords that

336
00:16:41,896 --> 00:16:46,056
As Casey mentioned,

337
00:16:46,056 --> 00:16:48,936
then it's considered an

338
00:16:48,936 --> 00:16:50,226
of the words are broad match.

339
00:16:52,616 --> 00:16:56,056
So LightRight is an exact

340
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:57,916
in light conditions

341
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:01,566
I have the option to

342
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:01,566
I have the option to

343
00:17:02,056 --> 00:17:03,826
But I plan to leave

344
00:17:04,205 --> 00:17:09,406
Advanced targeting

345
00:17:09,406 --> 00:17:12,675
to refine the audience

346
00:17:12,675 --> 00:17:13,876
for my particular app.

347
00:17:14,486 --> 00:17:18,036
The first default setting is

348
00:17:18,036 --> 00:17:20,266
who have not downloaded my app.

349
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:24,986
Other options, such as

350
00:17:24,986 --> 00:17:26,136
also open to me.

351
00:17:26,566 --> 00:17:30,686
But in my case, LightRight is a

352
00:17:30,686 --> 00:17:32,156
on acquiring new users.

353
00:17:32,576 --> 00:17:34,226
So I'll go with the

354
00:17:35,066 --> 00:17:38,526
If appropriate, I could

355
00:17:38,526 --> 00:17:40,426
to a specific gender or age.

356
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:44,926
For example, if your app is

357
00:17:44,926 --> 00:17:48,446
then you may target female

358
00:17:48,906 --> 00:17:51,596
But for my LightRight

359
00:17:52,016 --> 00:17:55,186
and genders would be excited

360
00:17:55,426 --> 00:17:57,716
so I'll skip the

361
00:18:00,056 --> 00:18:03,256
Device location can be a

362
00:18:03,256 --> 00:18:06,786
if your app only serves a

363
00:18:07,526 --> 00:18:10,756
For example, a food delivery

364
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:13,956
around San Francisco might

365
00:18:14,566 --> 00:18:20,016
Now that I've set up my initial

366
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:22,996
into the future and

367
00:18:24,196 --> 00:18:28,146
My average cost per tap at

368
00:18:28,716 --> 00:18:32,406
And my average cost per

369
00:18:32,726 --> 00:18:34,686
below my $2.50 target.

370
00:18:35,256 --> 00:18:38,116
My average conversion rate

371
00:18:38,736 --> 00:18:41,126
At a high level, these

372
00:18:41,706 --> 00:18:43,456
But I notice my impressions,

373
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:44,776
and conversions have flattened

374
00:18:45,216 --> 00:18:46,896
and are starting

375
00:18:47,566 --> 00:18:51,726
Given that my CPT and CPA

376
00:18:51,946 --> 00:18:54,646
there may be opportunity for

377
00:18:55,266 --> 00:18:57,446
Let's drill down into

378
00:18:57,446 --> 00:18:58,436
to see what's happening.

379
00:18:58,986 --> 00:19:01,466
To get there, I click

380
00:18:58,986 --> 00:19:01,466
To get there, I click

381
00:19:01,466 --> 00:19:02,666
and then on Search Term.

382
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:06,436
The Search Term view is where I

383
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:10,226
terms that match to my ad

384
00:19:10,226 --> 00:19:11,236
and their performance.

385
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:15,416
I can see here that

386
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:17,206
to some really relevant terms

387
00:19:17,336 --> 00:19:19,786
that are increasing

388
00:19:20,186 --> 00:19:23,516
Color edit search term is

389
00:19:23,516 --> 00:19:26,386
from my app at a

390
00:19:26,736 --> 00:19:28,836
I want to see if I can

391
00:19:28,836 --> 00:19:31,076
if I raise my max CPT bid.

392
00:19:31,406 --> 00:19:34,666
So I'm going to add it

393
00:19:44,066 --> 00:19:47,986
I'm going to up my

394
00:19:52,296 --> 00:19:54,466
Color search term,

395
00:19:54,466 --> 00:19:57,366
is driving very few

396
00:19:57,366 --> 00:20:01,436
It's a broad match to

397
00:19:57,366 --> 00:20:01,436
It's a broad match to

398
00:20:01,986 --> 00:20:05,026
So I'm going to add it as a

399
00:20:05,026 --> 00:20:09,286
as people searching color are

400
00:20:14,176 --> 00:20:14,896
to my app.

401
00:20:14,896 --> 00:20:17,246
Let's add color as a

402
00:20:19,456 --> 00:20:22,206
To learn and manage

403
00:20:22,206 --> 00:20:26,116
of the keywords I specifically

404
00:20:26,116 --> 00:20:30,196
over to the Manage Keyword tab.

405
00:20:30,356 --> 00:20:33,586
I see that app for lighting

406
00:20:33,586 --> 00:20:38,206
and the CPA at $5.17 is a

407
00:20:38,756 --> 00:20:42,966
I'm going to pause the app

408
00:20:50,306 --> 00:20:52,556
I like the picture

409
00:20:52,746 --> 00:20:54,556
as that is performing

410
00:20:54,926 --> 00:20:57,856
So I'm going to use

411
00:20:57,856 --> 00:21:00,956
to get recommendations for

412
00:20:57,856 --> 00:21:00,956
to get recommendations for

413
00:21:05,656 --> 00:21:07,646
So let's type in picture editor.

414
00:21:12,036 --> 00:21:14,236
The photo editor

415
00:21:14,756 --> 00:21:17,996
That should drive relevant

416
00:21:17,996 --> 00:21:20,426
I'll add it to my

417
00:21:20,966 --> 00:21:24,666
And it will show up at

418
00:21:25,236 --> 00:21:30,226
The reporting view is a great

419
00:21:30,226 --> 00:21:32,706
about your campaigns

420
00:21:33,236 --> 00:21:35,936
In my case, we're looking

421
00:21:35,936 --> 00:21:38,416
of device class and impressions.

422
00:21:39,516 --> 00:21:42,176
It seems that 80 percent

423
00:21:42,176 --> 00:21:43,926
for my app from an iPhone.

424
00:21:44,326 --> 00:21:47,256
Therefore, I should consider

425
00:21:47,256 --> 00:21:50,366
for iPhone so that I can

426
00:21:50,366 --> 00:21:52,706
to get more impressions

427
00:21:53,226 --> 00:21:57,596
Now I'm driving users to my

428
00:21:57,696 --> 00:21:58,596
That's great.

429
00:21:59,036 --> 00:22:00,376
But knowing the true value

430
00:21:59,036 --> 00:22:00,376
But knowing the true value

431
00:22:00,376 --> 00:22:03,406
of these downloads will help

432
00:22:03,606 --> 00:22:05,166
on my campaign investment.

433
00:22:05,886 --> 00:22:08,896
Because Search Ads, the App

434
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:12,646
to develop my app are all

435
00:22:12,976 --> 00:22:16,066
It's easy to know which of

436
00:22:16,066 --> 00:22:16,946
by Search Ads.

437
00:22:17,446 --> 00:22:20,636
The Search Ads attribution

438
00:22:20,636 --> 00:22:24,476
downloads to my campaign, but

439
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:27,346
to a specific bidded keyword

440
00:22:28,126 --> 00:22:31,276
It's a turnkey solution that

441
00:22:31,496 --> 00:22:33,766
and track meaningful

442
00:22:33,796 --> 00:22:35,476
and their value to me over time.

443
00:22:35,886 --> 00:22:38,636
This information will help

444
00:22:38,636 --> 00:22:41,956
and other targeting parameters

445
00:22:42,086 --> 00:22:43,896
And I can use those insights

446
00:22:43,896 --> 00:22:46,156
to optimize my campaign

447
00:22:47,006 --> 00:22:50,006
The best part about the

448
00:22:50,006 --> 00:22:50,906
is to instrument.

449
00:22:51,336 --> 00:22:54,936
You just need the ad -- the I

450
00:22:54,936 --> 00:22:57,736
and then add these lines of

451
00:22:58,716 --> 00:23:01,236
Here's the response object

452
00:22:58,716 --> 00:23:01,236
Here's the response object

453
00:23:01,236 --> 00:23:03,876
that contains campaign

454
00:23:03,876 --> 00:23:06,506
download date, and click date.

455
00:23:06,916 --> 00:23:09,976
While the API allows

456
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:14,496
and segment your users, rest

457
00:23:14,496 --> 00:23:17,516
or transmit any personal

458
00:23:17,516 --> 00:23:18,636
to any third parties.

459
00:23:19,086 --> 00:23:22,046
We accomplish this by enabling

460

customer relationship

462
00:23:28,876 --> 00:23:30,236
to prevent information look

up at the top of relevant

471
00:23:55,566 --> 00:23:59,016
that millions of users are

472
00:23:59,706 --> 00:24:04,466

We've talked about a

485
00:24:40,586 --> 00:24:42,986
But there are a few things

486
00:24:42,986 --> 00:24:46,036
to get prepared for Search Ads.

487
00:24:46,266 --> 00:24:49,046
Firstly, optimize

488
00:24:49,046 --> 00:24:51,536
and ensure it is

489
00:24:51,836 --> 00:24:56,556
and accurate reflection

490
00:24:56,556 --> 00:24:58,266
Understand the value

491
00:24:58,266 --> 00:25:00,416
and how much you can

492
00:24:58,266 --> 00:25:00,416
and how much you can

493
00:25:00,856 --> 00:25:05,456
This will help you determine

494
00:25:05,666 --> 00:25:08,466
And lastly, implement

495
00:25:08,466 --> 00:25:09,136
