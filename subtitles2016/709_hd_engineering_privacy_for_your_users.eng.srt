00:00:33,046 --> 00:00:34,686
&gt;&gt; Hello everyone and welcome

4
00:00:34,686 --> 00:00:36,726
to Engineering Privacy

5
00:00:37,446 --> 00:00:39,346
I am Julien from

6
00:00:39,346 --> 00:00:41,346
and I'm super excited

7
00:00:42,686 --> 00:00:45,996
Do you ever wonder how

8
00:00:46,186 --> 00:00:47,416
without creeping them out?

9
00:00:48,956 --> 00:00:52,226
Do you ever argue with your

10
00:00:52,226 --> 00:00:55,856
and transparency to others

11
00:00:56,546 --> 00:00:59,086
Well to answer these questions

12
00:00:59,156 --> 00:01:01,326
through privacy technologies

13
00:00:59,156 --> 00:01:01,326
through privacy technologies

14
00:01:01,746 --> 00:01:03,376
and how you can adopt them too.

15
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:08,676
As many of you know we at Apple

16
00:01:09,416 --> 00:01:11,846
Just last year Tim Cook quote.

17
00:01:12,676 --> 00:01:16,936
"People have entrusted us with

18
00:01:17,486 --> 00:01:19,956
We owe them nothing less

19
00:01:19,956 --> 00:01:21,426
that we can possibly provide."

20
00:01:21,746 --> 00:01:25,306
I mean it's not just Tim, all

21
00:01:25,306 --> 00:01:29,236
down believe that privacy is

22
00:01:29,636 --> 00:01:32,226
In order to build

23
00:01:32,226 --> 00:01:33,536
that protects your data.

24
00:01:35,036 --> 00:01:38,736
So privacy engineering, we're a

25
00:01:38,736 --> 00:01:42,636
across Apple in order to build

26
00:01:43,246 --> 00:01:47,646
And year after year we

27
00:01:47,646 --> 00:01:51,946
and services are those

28
00:01:52,116 --> 00:01:54,756
without compromising

29
00:01:55,236 --> 00:02:00,276
They are great services

30
00:01:55,236 --> 00:02:00,276
They are great services

31
00:02:00,466 --> 00:02:02,466
and also respect user privacy.

32
00:02:03,076 --> 00:02:05,406
They encourage users

33
00:02:05,606 --> 00:02:08,906
by offering transparency,

34
00:02:09,276 --> 00:02:12,496
but also securing the

35
00:02:12,496 --> 00:02:15,656
that you collect and limiting

36
00:02:16,786 --> 00:02:20,216
As more and more

37
00:02:20,216 --> 00:02:22,146
on our devices, we believe

38
00:02:22,146 --> 00:02:25,996
that privacy is becoming

39
00:02:26,606 --> 00:02:27,936
and it's worth your investment.

40
00:02:29,036 --> 00:02:31,826
But privacy is also more

41
00:02:31,826 --> 00:02:33,816
as they said here,

42
00:02:33,816 --> 00:02:35,616
to do smarter engineering.

43
00:02:35,756 --> 00:02:37,746
To consider other

44
00:02:37,746 --> 00:02:39,396
for the benefits of our users.

45
00:02:40,046 --> 00:02:43,446
For example, it encourages

46
00:02:43,446 --> 00:02:46,026
to bring the intelligence

47
00:02:46,236 --> 00:02:50,316
for faster user experience and

48
00:02:50,316 --> 00:02:54,526
So it encourages you to only

49
00:02:54,876 --> 00:02:56,606
in order to improve

50
00:02:57,516 --> 00:03:00,506
So today we're going to

51
00:02:57,516 --> 00:03:00,506
So today we're going to

52
00:03:01,066 --> 00:03:03,996
how to collect data tied

53
00:03:04,436 --> 00:03:07,166
which kind of controls

54
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:10,616
to your users, as well as

55
00:03:10,616 --> 00:03:13,036
to build privacy into your app.

56
00:03:13,756 --> 00:03:15,606
Let's start with identifiers.

57
00:03:17,536 --> 00:03:21,576
Many of you every day rely on

58
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:24,556
to know your users and analyze

59
00:03:24,556 --> 00:03:28,706
And this is great, after

60
00:03:28,706 --> 00:03:30,316
with good identifiers.

61
00:03:30,866 --> 00:03:37,416
But, if you track everything

62
00:03:37,766 --> 00:03:41,006
it creates an uncomfortable

63
00:03:41,336 --> 00:03:44,886
sort of a chilling effect

64
00:03:45,376 --> 00:03:47,926
if I tap on this link

65
00:03:47,926 --> 00:03:49,266
to be tracked back to me?

66
00:03:50,016 --> 00:03:53,656
And as soon as your users

67
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:56,936
Identifiers are very

68
00:03:56,936 --> 00:03:59,766
to build customized

69
00:03:59,766 --> 00:04:03,246
to know your users and offer

70
00:03:59,766 --> 00:04:03,246
to know your users and offer

71
00:04:03,516 --> 00:04:06,916
But if you use them for too long

72
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:10,806
to build creepy suggestions that

73
00:04:12,076 --> 00:04:15,926
Identifiers are also super

74
00:04:16,136 --> 00:04:18,546
and to prevent and

75
00:04:18,546 --> 00:04:19,796
as early as possible.

76
00:04:20,185 --> 00:04:23,886
But they do not justify

77
00:04:23,886 --> 00:04:25,026
from all your users.

78
00:04:25,336 --> 00:04:26,516
So what can you do?

79
00:04:27,696 --> 00:04:30,786
Well there are a number of best

80
00:04:31,036 --> 00:04:33,616
First of all, favor

81
00:04:34,066 --> 00:04:36,556
You don't systematically

82
00:04:36,556 --> 00:04:39,006
of persistent identifiers

83
00:04:39,006 --> 00:04:41,696
So you can make them change

84
00:04:41,846 --> 00:04:43,886
or make it very easy

85
00:04:44,966 --> 00:04:47,846
Stick to random identifiers

86
00:04:47,846 --> 00:04:50,176
and systematically using

87
00:04:50,176 --> 00:04:51,676
email address, or phone number.

88
00:04:51,936 --> 00:04:53,426
Most of the time

89
00:04:53,806 --> 00:04:57,256
And ask yourself do I really

90
00:04:57,316 --> 00:04:59,496
or is it enough to have

91
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:01,996
an anonymous experience

92
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:01,996
an anonymous experience

93
00:05:02,456 --> 00:05:04,916
By following some of these

94
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:07,826
to make it very easy for your

95
00:05:07,826 --> 00:05:09,836
without having to worry

96
00:05:09,836 --> 00:05:12,016
So let's have a look

97
00:05:13,196 --> 00:05:16,196
In our own products we seek to

98
00:05:16,426 --> 00:05:19,726
So for example in Spotlight

99
00:05:19,726 --> 00:05:21,966
that change periodically

100
00:05:22,316 --> 00:05:25,366
so users can engage with

101
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:27,136
to worry about their privacy.

102
00:05:27,506 --> 00:05:30,246
We customize the experience

103
00:05:30,466 --> 00:05:33,156
within those session where

104
00:05:34,686 --> 00:05:38,936
We also seek to make it easy to

105
00:05:39,296 --> 00:05:43,326
So for example, in Siri, it's as

106
00:05:43,326 --> 00:05:46,276
and on and you get a new

107
00:05:46,276 --> 00:05:47,966
over again, you're in control.

108
00:05:48,826 --> 00:05:53,896
We also generally seek to

109
00:05:54,066 --> 00:05:56,066
because most of the time

110
00:05:56,066 --> 00:05:57,286
to provide our services.

111
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:01,066
We also want to make it easy

112
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:01,066
We also want to make it easy

113
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:03,706
of techniques and

114
00:06:03,706 --> 00:06:06,696
So we have a number of APIs

115
00:06:07,016 --> 00:06:09,136
very easily generate

116
00:06:09,366 --> 00:06:12,966
So for example, the universally

117
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:16,156
a simple line of code

118
00:06:16,156 --> 00:06:18,356
to create an identifier

119
00:06:19,056 --> 00:06:22,616
So a quick example, if you call,

120
00:06:22,616 --> 00:06:25,986
whenever you call this

121
00:06:25,986 --> 00:06:26,696
random numbers.

122
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:28,766
It's such a large

123
00:06:28,766 --> 00:06:32,056
to be a globally unique random

124
00:06:32,056 --> 00:06:34,266
So if you call it again,

125
00:06:34,516 --> 00:06:35,776
call it again etcetera.

126
00:06:36,196 --> 00:06:39,046
So then it's up to you

127
00:06:39,256 --> 00:06:40,916
with this random number.

128
00:06:40,916 --> 00:06:44,696
You can use it to identify

129
00:06:45,546 --> 00:06:48,086
But what if you're looking

130
00:06:48,086 --> 00:06:49,836
you're not looking to

131
00:06:50,186 --> 00:06:51,376
but you want to access one.

132
00:06:51,616 --> 00:06:53,516
Well the vender IDs

133
00:06:53,976 --> 00:06:55,866
The problem it solves for you is

134
00:06:55,866 --> 00:06:59,526
that it can just access this

135
00:06:59,526 --> 00:07:03,106
for a device, it's very easy

136
00:06:59,526 --> 00:07:03,106
for a device, it's very easy

137
00:07:03,106 --> 00:07:05,546
you don't even have to

138
00:07:05,546 --> 00:07:08,966
And the way it works is

139
00:07:08,966 --> 00:07:12,096
for a certain app,

140
00:07:12,346 --> 00:07:14,246
you will get the same

141
00:07:14,246 --> 00:07:15,456
to you, the same UUID.

142
00:07:15,766 --> 00:07:18,096
So if you have the two

143
00:07:18,436 --> 00:07:22,436
made by the same vendor,

144
00:07:22,566 --> 00:07:24,116
and this just makes

145
00:07:24,116 --> 00:07:27,006
to customize your

146
00:07:27,456 --> 00:07:30,016
Now, an app from a different

147
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:31,116
UUID altogether.

148
00:07:32,086 --> 00:07:33,986
Note that users have

149
00:07:34,236 --> 00:07:36,916
by uninstalling your apps.

150
00:07:37,886 --> 00:07:39,566
Another stable identifier

151
00:07:39,566 --> 00:07:41,886
by the operating system

152
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:45,346
This one is to be used for

153
00:07:45,836 --> 00:07:49,036
and the way it works is

154
00:07:49,146 --> 00:07:51,626
it will be able to

155
00:07:51,626 --> 00:07:52,886
for the current device.

156
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:56,466
And so this number will

157
00:07:56,696 --> 00:08:00,536
unless the user decides to reset

158
00:07:56,696 --> 00:08:00,536
unless the user decides to reset

159
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:04,216
So in summary there are a

160
00:08:04,216 --> 00:08:06,486
and each have a different

161
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:07,956
about generating an identifier

162
00:08:08,216 --> 00:08:10,946
or accessing identifier

163
00:08:11,446 --> 00:08:14,086
In addition to identifiers

164
00:08:14,086 --> 00:08:15,256
there are network identifiers.

165
00:08:15,436 --> 00:08:18,146
So whenever you scan in

166
00:08:18,286 --> 00:08:22,246
to a Wi-Fi network, you reveal

167
00:08:22,246 --> 00:08:25,316
to see and that can be a

168
00:08:25,896 --> 00:08:29,636
So in iOS 8 we changed

169
00:08:29,886 --> 00:08:33,196
so that we start using locally

170
00:08:33,196 --> 00:08:36,046
that change over time

171
00:08:36,535 --> 00:08:38,686
for your privacy, you

172
00:08:39,035 --> 00:08:41,726
because we make it much harder

173
00:08:41,726 --> 00:08:45,186
And we're very glad and proud

174
00:08:45,186 --> 00:08:47,276
on iOS, but on macOS as well.

175
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:50,986
So if you're a Wi-Fi lender

176
00:08:51,366 --> 00:08:54,166
we encourage you to not

177
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,576
with iOS seeds, but

178
00:08:57,976 --> 00:09:02,156
You must have heard of messages

179
00:08:57,976 --> 00:09:02,156
You must have heard of messages

180
00:09:02,336 --> 00:09:05,176
This is a super cool feature

181
00:09:05,486 --> 00:09:09,386
So app extensions will not be

182
00:09:09,566 --> 00:09:12,126
what they will see is

183
00:09:12,386 --> 00:09:14,746
And that UUID will be different

184
00:09:14,786 --> 00:09:18,286
for each app extension

185
00:09:18,926 --> 00:09:20,416
So it's super privacy friendly.

186
00:09:21,116 --> 00:09:24,166
Now, even if you're

187
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:28,266
or generate identifiers, you

188
00:09:28,266 --> 00:09:29,616
that looks innocuous.

189
00:09:29,806 --> 00:09:33,266
But the problem there is that

190
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:36,036
you might actually end

191
00:09:36,036 --> 00:09:39,756
and stable device fingerprint

192
00:09:40,116 --> 00:09:42,716
And that can be a problem

193
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,766
Where you thought your

194
00:09:44,766 --> 00:09:46,726
and then some researchers

195
00:09:46,726 --> 00:09:49,536
that actually it was very easy

196
00:09:50,016 --> 00:09:52,566
So you don't want to be in that

197
00:09:52,566 --> 00:09:54,206
to minimize the data

198
00:09:54,786 --> 00:09:56,496
And we also try to

199
00:09:56,856 --> 00:10:00,576
We seek to build a strong and

200
00:09:56,856 --> 00:10:00,576
We seek to build a strong and

201
00:10:00,576 --> 00:10:03,186
and your app from

202
00:10:03,496 --> 00:10:08,106
and also protects you from

203
00:10:09,036 --> 00:10:11,236
So what we do there is we

204
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:13,176
and amazing APIs

205
00:10:13,486 --> 00:10:17,346
but we provide a protection

206
00:10:17,346 --> 00:10:18,976
that could be used

207
00:10:19,046 --> 00:10:22,796
So for example, this year

208
00:10:22,796 --> 00:10:24,596
that could be used

209
00:10:24,816 --> 00:10:27,656
and we also whitelisted some

210
00:10:27,656 --> 00:10:29,896
for you and blacklisted

211
00:10:30,146 --> 00:10:31,716
that could be used

212
00:10:32,326 --> 00:10:35,296
So in summary what does

213
00:10:36,626 --> 00:10:39,016
Identifiers are great,

214
00:10:39,016 --> 00:10:41,916
that you favor short-lived

215
00:10:42,246 --> 00:10:46,146
and that you also stick to OS

216
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:47,426
or generate identifiers.

217
00:10:47,986 --> 00:10:50,786
We think that the users will

218
00:10:50,786 --> 00:10:53,926
with your app and to

219
00:10:54,436 --> 00:10:57,266
So talking about data, let's

220
00:10:59,236 --> 00:11:02,506
Many of you every day

221
00:10:59,236 --> 00:11:02,506
Many of you every day

222
00:11:02,776 --> 00:11:05,316
And this is very helpful to

223
00:11:05,316 --> 00:11:06,456
to product development.

224
00:11:06,836 --> 00:11:07,766
And this is super cool.

225
00:11:08,526 --> 00:11:12,456
Now one day, you may end up in a

226
00:11:12,456 --> 00:11:14,876
so much about your

227
00:11:14,876 --> 00:11:16,676
about them then they

228
00:11:17,506 --> 00:11:18,156
And that's weird.

229
00:11:20,436 --> 00:11:25,276
So ask yourselves how would you

230
00:11:25,276 --> 00:11:26,446
that you had about them?

231
00:11:26,446 --> 00:11:27,906
Would you feel embarrassed?

232
00:11:29,136 --> 00:11:31,826
What if you had to collect

233
00:11:31,826 --> 00:11:33,256
or your mom, or your siblings?

234
00:11:34,706 --> 00:11:36,836
Data is as much a

235
00:11:37,036 --> 00:11:38,356
And you need to balance

236
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:40,556
So what can you do?

237
00:11:42,226 --> 00:11:46,296
We recommend you put in

238
00:11:46,296 --> 00:11:47,536
collection practices.

239
00:11:48,196 --> 00:11:52,406
And in particular, instead of

240
00:11:52,406 --> 00:11:55,596
just grabbing everything you can

241
00:11:55,596 --> 00:11:59,426
in the future, try to stick

242
00:11:59,756 --> 00:12:01,536
and collect data for those.

243
00:11:59,756 --> 00:12:01,536
and collect data for those.

244
00:12:01,956 --> 00:12:05,156
Here is a number of techniques

245
00:12:05,406 --> 00:12:07,816
Bucketing, sampling

246
00:12:08,346 --> 00:12:10,046
Let's look at bucketing.

247
00:12:10,866 --> 00:12:14,786
The idea of bucketing is to

248
00:12:14,786 --> 00:12:17,026
that is sufficient

249
00:12:18,366 --> 00:12:20,406
So, let's say you

250
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:24,586
how often are your users

251
00:12:24,976 --> 00:12:27,566
So we ask this question

252
00:12:27,566 --> 00:12:30,676
So it's quite simple, you

253
00:12:30,826 --> 00:12:32,716
and you look and you measure.

254
00:12:32,956 --> 00:12:37,156
So let's say for this user,

255
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:38,566
on a given day to

256
00:12:38,566 --> 00:12:41,986
So this information is helpful

257
00:12:41,986 --> 00:12:44,356
that maybe something is wrong

258
00:12:44,686 --> 00:12:46,796
Maybe you want to make

259
00:12:47,696 --> 00:12:49,726
But do you really

260
00:12:49,726 --> 00:12:51,306
with this level of precision?

261
00:12:51,776 --> 00:12:55,606
Would it be sufficient to only

262
00:12:55,606 --> 00:12:57,866
to your in-app settings

263
00:12:58,106 --> 00:13:00,046
That would also give

264
00:12:58,106 --> 00:13:00,046
That would also give

265
00:13:00,046 --> 00:13:01,796
that maybe there's

266
00:13:02,006 --> 00:13:04,156
and to further refine

267
00:13:05,796 --> 00:13:07,946
But what if you're

268
00:13:07,946 --> 00:13:11,766
not just about a specific user,

269
00:13:12,706 --> 00:13:13,766
Well, you can just collect

270
00:13:13,766 --> 00:13:15,546
and ask the same

271
00:13:16,016 --> 00:13:19,536
And so you will say how often

272
00:13:19,536 --> 00:13:20,236
on a given day?

273
00:13:20,236 --> 00:13:23,276
Well it turns out like

274
00:13:23,276 --> 00:13:25,586
to collect the average

275
00:13:25,586 --> 00:13:28,516
to collect this data from

276
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:31,696
to get good statistically

277
00:13:31,696 --> 00:13:32,526
of the average.

278
00:13:32,866 --> 00:13:37,796
It turns out if you only collect

279
00:13:38,236 --> 00:13:40,696
you get a good estimate

280
00:13:41,046 --> 00:13:43,886
In fact, if you collect

281
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:47,136
your estimate is as

282
00:13:47,856 --> 00:13:51,036
So you really don't need to

283
00:13:51,036 --> 00:13:53,386
from all of your users

284
00:13:53,386 --> 00:13:55,616
of performance indicator

285
00:13:57,706 --> 00:13:59,306
But what if you're looking

286
00:13:59,306 --> 00:14:01,866
to collect some data

287
00:13:59,306 --> 00:14:01,866
to collect some data

288
00:14:02,286 --> 00:14:05,026
Something that you really

289
00:14:05,026 --> 00:14:06,046
in the first place.

290
00:14:06,896 --> 00:14:09,706
But you're interested to learn

291
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:14,326
Well, what if there was a

292
00:14:14,326 --> 00:14:18,876
to learn from the crowd while

293
00:14:19,946 --> 00:14:22,356
Well there is such a technology

294
00:14:22,356 --> 00:14:24,096
and it's called differential

295
00:14:24,856 --> 00:14:27,986
So, differential privacy

296
00:14:27,986 --> 00:14:29,666
for users to donate their data.

297
00:14:30,976 --> 00:14:34,136
It is one way to learn

298
00:14:34,136 --> 00:14:35,556
protecting individuals.

299
00:14:36,236 --> 00:14:37,656
It provides strong

300
00:14:37,656 --> 00:14:40,436
and mathematical

301
00:14:41,096 --> 00:14:44,396
And this year we are

302
00:14:45,186 --> 00:14:48,116
So, before I get

303
00:14:48,116 --> 00:14:51,226
First, we believe that

304
00:14:51,226 --> 00:14:54,146
in our privacy toolbox.

305
00:14:54,396 --> 00:14:56,716
We have a number of tools

306
00:14:56,866 --> 00:14:59,356
and this is a very exciting

307
00:14:59,856 --> 00:15:02,486
Second, this is going

308
00:14:59,856 --> 00:15:02,486
Second, this is going

309
00:15:02,486 --> 00:15:05,476
into a fascinating

310
00:15:05,476 --> 00:15:08,556
to inspire you and get

311
00:15:08,846 --> 00:15:09,786
So let's get started.

312
00:15:11,056 --> 00:15:13,846
I said it gives you strong

313
00:15:14,106 --> 00:15:15,846
So let's start with

314
00:15:17,436 --> 00:15:20,976
No, I think we can try to do it

315
00:15:20,976 --> 00:15:24,186
So the idea is there's some

316
00:15:24,676 --> 00:15:28,106
and you add noise to it and

317
00:15:28,596 --> 00:15:31,156
And then you can aggregate

318
00:15:31,536 --> 00:15:32,626
to extract some signal.

319
00:15:33,646 --> 00:15:36,336
So let's say an example, how

320
00:15:36,586 --> 00:15:37,546
to prepare these slides.

321
00:15:37,636 --> 00:15:41,096
So it was a busy week, so

322
00:15:41,386 --> 00:15:45,296
So, I can add noise to that and

323
00:15:45,296 --> 00:15:47,466
that I change this number to

324
00:15:47,466 --> 00:15:50,996
So let's look a little bit more

325
00:15:51,746 --> 00:15:55,116
So, disclaimer this is

326
00:15:55,116 --> 00:15:57,716
but that's going to give you

327
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:02,766
So I have this number 128, and

328
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:02,766
So I have this number 128, and

329
00:16:02,766 --> 00:16:04,646
it's sort of a hash

330
00:16:04,646 --> 00:16:08,406
So what I do is a print a

331
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:11,986
and I only write one

332
00:16:11,986 --> 00:16:15,526
So it's a huge vector full

333
00:16:17,146 --> 00:16:20,256
Then by noise, what I mean

334
00:16:20,256 --> 00:16:21,966
of these zeros and

335
00:16:22,266 --> 00:16:24,296
So some zeros are

336
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:26,406
And some ones are

337
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:32,116
The trick here is that zeros

338
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:34,416
to remain zeros than

339
00:16:34,996 --> 00:16:37,886
And ones have slightly

340
00:16:37,886 --> 00:16:39,896
to remain ones than

341
00:16:40,246 --> 00:16:44,386
So this is one way to

342
00:16:44,386 --> 00:16:45,896
to sharing it with Apple.

343
00:16:46,716 --> 00:16:49,856
It's another thing that's an

344
00:16:50,106 --> 00:16:52,426
is that if I were to

345
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:53,996
even if it's the same number,

346
00:16:54,386 --> 00:16:56,466
each time it will give

347
00:16:57,326 --> 00:17:00,666
And unlike a typical hash

348
00:16:57,326 --> 00:17:00,666
And unlike a typical hash

349
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:02,936
to do a dictionary

350
00:17:02,936 --> 00:17:04,876
out what this value

351
00:17:05,465 --> 00:17:08,396
So this is all done

352
00:17:09,146 --> 00:17:13,925
So, this is all done

353
00:17:13,925 --> 00:17:15,146
to sharing it with Apple.

354
00:17:15,146 --> 00:17:18,376
So, in this example let's

355
00:17:18,376 --> 00:17:20,465
of hours people worked

356
00:17:20,705 --> 00:17:25,695
so I worked 128 hours, Jessie

357
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:29,226
So we collect all of this

358
00:17:29,446 --> 00:17:31,226
and the noise is added

359
00:17:31,226 --> 00:17:35,476
And what Apple ends up

360
00:17:35,476 --> 00:17:36,706
and noisy vectors,

361
00:17:36,896 --> 00:17:40,306
where individually these vectors

362
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:44,356
But we're able to combine them

363
00:17:44,356 --> 00:17:47,056
out and learn some

364
00:17:47,496 --> 00:17:50,446
For example, here the average

365
00:17:50,446 --> 00:17:52,426
at Apple last week was 41 hours.

366
00:17:53,206 --> 00:17:55,766
So the way we do that

367
00:17:55,766 --> 00:17:58,266
up all these vectors

368
00:17:58,456 --> 00:17:59,496
And then we look at column

369
00:17:59,496 --> 00:18:02,836
by column whether there is a

370
00:17:59,496 --> 00:18:02,836
by column whether there is a

371
00:18:03,046 --> 00:18:04,256
that is larger than random.

372
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:06,516
So why is this cool?

373
00:18:06,686 --> 00:18:10,236
So we think it's really

374
00:18:10,236 --> 00:18:12,726
to learn popular

375
00:18:13,126 --> 00:18:16,396
You can learn averages, the

376
00:18:16,986 --> 00:18:19,486
or even frequencies

377
00:18:20,006 --> 00:18:21,486
And this is done in a way

378
00:18:21,486 --> 00:18:24,626
where each individual

379
00:18:24,626 --> 00:18:26,066
Is kept private from Apple.

380
00:18:26,256 --> 00:18:28,206
We can only learn

381
00:18:29,426 --> 00:18:34,596
But you might ask yourself what

382
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:36,226
that is contributing data here?

383
00:18:37,106 --> 00:18:40,726
At some point maybe a user will

384
00:18:41,436 --> 00:18:44,036
Well, to avoid this

385
00:18:44,036 --> 00:18:47,716
of privacy budget that restricts

386
00:18:47,716 --> 00:18:51,466
that can be made by any certain

387
00:18:52,036 --> 00:18:55,446
We also don't have any

388
00:18:55,446 --> 00:18:56,386
with this information.

389
00:18:56,566 --> 00:18:59,216
And we permanently delete

390
00:18:59,216 --> 00:19:01,136
So let's have a look

391
00:18:59,216 --> 00:19:01,136
So let's have a look

392
00:19:01,726 --> 00:19:05,156
Say we wanted to learn

393
00:19:05,156 --> 00:19:09,036
that are opting in to

394
00:19:09,036 --> 00:19:10,576
that we collect from customers.

395
00:19:11,036 --> 00:19:13,746
So when people will start

396
00:19:13,746 --> 00:19:16,646
and use emoji's we will

397
00:19:17,006 --> 00:19:19,776
and then Julien here,

398
00:19:20,026 --> 00:19:22,666
which contributed their

399
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:24,536
on device prior to

400
00:19:24,776 --> 00:19:27,806
And what happens is as more and

401
00:19:28,096 --> 00:19:30,286
we're able to extract

402
00:19:30,286 --> 00:19:31,846
which ones are the most popular.

403
00:19:32,066 --> 00:19:35,776
So what's cool here is that one

404
00:19:35,776 --> 00:19:36,976
UI to reflect that.

405
00:19:36,976 --> 00:19:40,296
And we can come and do

406
00:19:41,006 --> 00:19:43,456
And so this year we're

407
00:19:43,716 --> 00:19:45,426
in four types of use cases.

408
00:19:45,696 --> 00:19:48,176
We're using it for

409
00:19:48,776 --> 00:19:50,816
we're also using

410
00:19:50,816 --> 00:19:52,146
So when we learn

411
00:19:52,146 --> 00:19:53,896
in our local dictionary,

412
00:19:54,386 --> 00:19:56,926
We also use it for

413
00:19:56,926 --> 00:19:59,406
which Deeplinks are

414
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:04,976
to promote them in Spotlight

415
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:04,976
to promote them in Spotlight

416
00:20:05,056 --> 00:20:06,186
So this is super exciting.

417
00:20:06,346 --> 00:20:10,066
And we're looking forward to

418
00:20:10,806 --> 00:20:13,426
But this is only collected

419
00:20:13,426 --> 00:20:15,356
in into diagnostic and usage.

420
00:20:15,636 --> 00:20:18,336
So if you are not opted

421
00:20:18,336 --> 00:20:20,056
we're not collecting

422
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:21,696
So you are in control.

423
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:24,986
So in summary what does

424
00:20:25,576 --> 00:20:29,116
Well we think that differential

425
00:20:29,116 --> 00:20:30,086
technology in order

426
00:20:30,086 --> 00:20:31,956
to do privacy friendly

427
00:20:32,536 --> 00:20:35,956
We're very excited to adopt

428
00:20:35,996 --> 00:20:39,726
to do crowd-driven insight

429
00:20:40,476 --> 00:20:41,756
We don't use any identifiers,

430
00:20:42,186 --> 00:20:44,066
we don't collect any

431
00:20:45,266 --> 00:20:50,246
This is yet another tool

432
00:20:50,356 --> 00:20:53,106
And we hope to use it more and

433
00:20:53,106 --> 00:20:54,986
to build our future features.

434
00:20:56,356 --> 00:20:58,696
We think that your

435
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:01,846
because they will see the length

436
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:01,846
because they will see the length

437
00:21:02,116 --> 00:21:03,936
in order to protect

438
00:21:04,256 --> 00:21:06,026
So we hope this is

439
00:21:06,026 --> 00:21:09,006
to develop privacy

440
00:21:09,706 --> 00:21:12,726
In order to speak to

441
00:21:12,726 --> 00:21:15,336
I'd like to invite

442
00:21:15,576 --> 00:21:15,916
Thank you [applause].

443
00:21:17,366 --> 00:21:17,496
&gt;&gt; Hi.

444
00:21:18,106 --> 00:21:18,516
I'm Jessie.

445
00:21:18,766 --> 00:21:20,486
I'm also on the privacy

446
00:21:20,976 --> 00:21:23,336
I work on privacy on for

447
00:21:23,766 --> 00:21:25,216
photos, and education.

448
00:21:26,716 --> 00:21:28,856
So Julien went into great

449
00:21:28,856 --> 00:21:32,386
about how you can identify your

450
00:21:32,386 --> 00:21:34,456
about them in order to

451
00:21:34,566 --> 00:21:36,316
but in a privacy friendly way.

452
00:21:36,596 --> 00:21:39,656
So in addition to that it's

453
00:21:39,656 --> 00:21:41,176
to your users about

454
00:21:41,176 --> 00:21:42,736
and the data that you collect.

455
00:21:43,626 --> 00:21:45,486
When you do they have

456
00:21:45,486 --> 00:21:47,176
of their privacy

457
00:21:48,136 --> 00:21:50,206
And when users have that

458
00:21:50,436 --> 00:21:54,176
you gain their trust and you

459
00:21:54,176 --> 00:21:55,616
within your app.

460
00:21:55,956 --> 00:21:58,636
So one way that we're increasing

461
00:21:58,636 --> 00:22:02,006
with advertising in iOS 10.

462
00:21:58,636 --> 00:22:02,006
with advertising in iOS 10.

463
00:22:02,226 --> 00:22:05,766
So now in news and in the

464
00:22:05,766 --> 00:22:08,586
to see this blue Ad button

465
00:22:09,196 --> 00:22:11,466
When they click on it

466
00:22:11,466 --> 00:22:12,736
about why they're

467
00:22:13,736 --> 00:22:16,286
So when you and other developers

468
00:22:16,526 --> 00:22:19,186
you pick specific

469
00:22:19,186 --> 00:22:20,576
to target your advertisements

470
00:22:21,416 --> 00:22:23,986
Well now users are able to

471
00:22:24,186 --> 00:22:27,446
to see exactly what,

472
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:28,826
into for this advertisement.

473
00:22:29,666 --> 00:22:34,186
In addition, users can also

474
00:22:36,016 --> 00:22:40,366
Advertising, View

475
00:22:40,366 --> 00:22:44,176
And we are being completely

476
00:22:44,396 --> 00:22:46,726
About all the user data we

477
00:22:46,726 --> 00:22:49,336
as advertisements in news

478
00:22:49,336 --> 00:22:51,446
And this will be

479
00:22:52,916 --> 00:22:56,436
So a way that we give users

480
00:22:56,436 --> 00:22:57,676
through Limit Ad Tracking.

481
00:22:59,046 --> 00:22:59,776
So, as Julien talked

482
00:22:59,776 --> 00:23:02,166
about earlier we have the

483
00:22:59,776 --> 00:23:02,166
about earlier we have the

484
00:23:02,536 --> 00:23:04,606
and you can use this

485
00:23:04,606 --> 00:23:06,736
for advertising purposes

486
00:23:07,976 --> 00:23:10,916
When users toggle the

487
00:23:11,246 --> 00:23:13,616
this is signaling to us that

488
00:23:13,616 --> 00:23:14,856
for advertising purposes.

489
00:23:15,596 --> 00:23:17,966
So in iOS 10 we're taking

490
00:23:18,276 --> 00:23:21,496
So when a user enables Limit

491
00:23:21,496 --> 00:23:24,136
identifier becomes

492
00:23:25,156 --> 00:23:27,496
It is now technically

493
00:23:27,696 --> 00:23:29,716
that when a user enables

494
00:23:29,906 --> 00:23:32,346
we cannot track them using

495
00:23:33,596 --> 00:23:35,946
Now if a user disables

496
00:23:36,386 --> 00:23:39,106
your app can get access to

497
00:23:39,106 --> 00:23:44,956
So you may be wondering, can

498
00:23:44,956 --> 00:23:46,616
to users with Limit

499
00:23:47,196 --> 00:23:48,006
Well of course you can.

500
00:23:48,346 --> 00:23:50,256
You can show contextual

501
00:23:50,586 --> 00:23:51,816
Things that make

502
00:23:52,916 --> 00:23:55,686
You just cannot track them

503
00:23:55,686 --> 00:23:57,126
if they have Limit

504
00:23:58,096 --> 00:23:59,866
And remember that it forbidden

505
00:24:00,006 --> 00:24:02,906
to cache the advertising

506
00:24:02,906 --> 00:24:04,746
as this does not give

507
00:24:04,746 --> 00:24:07,296
over resetting it.

508
00:24:07,536 --> 00:24:08,686
So, what does this

509
00:24:08,686 --> 00:24:13,656
Well, there's an increase in

510
00:24:13,656 --> 00:24:15,836
to users in news

511
00:24:16,316 --> 00:24:19,276
and Limit Ad Tracking is now

512
00:24:20,706 --> 00:24:23,636
We know that when users are able

513
00:24:23,636 --> 00:24:27,176
like enabling Limit Ad

514
00:24:27,246 --> 00:24:30,546
to make good privacy decisions

515
00:24:30,746 --> 00:24:34,306
Another way that we give users

516
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:36,316
of decisions are

517
00:24:37,006 --> 00:24:42,656
So in iOS, macOS, tvOS, and

518
00:24:42,656 --> 00:24:44,266
to decide which apps get access

519
00:24:44,306 --> 00:24:46,026
to certain protected

520
00:24:46,936 --> 00:24:49,736
Now protected classes of data

521
00:24:50,206 --> 00:24:53,026
contacts, photos, HomeKit.

522
00:24:53,466 --> 00:24:56,926
So the first time that

523
00:24:56,926 --> 00:24:58,926
to this protected class

524
00:24:59,596 --> 00:25:01,206
iOS shows an alert

525
00:24:59,596 --> 00:25:01,206
iOS shows an alert

526
00:25:01,746 --> 00:25:04,006
And at this point the user

527
00:25:04,326 --> 00:25:06,786
if your app should

528
00:25:07,916 --> 00:25:11,376
When the timing and the context

529
00:25:12,486 --> 00:25:14,426
the user can make the choice

530
00:25:14,896 --> 00:25:16,176
We call this a just

531
00:25:16,176 --> 00:25:20,606
I want to talk to you

532
00:25:20,606 --> 00:25:23,146
that we have this year, that

533
00:25:23,146 --> 00:25:24,636
and consent alerts

534
00:25:25,416 --> 00:25:28,336
The first is the media

535
00:25:28,946 --> 00:25:33,106
This give access to Apple

536
00:25:33,266 --> 00:25:38,056
subscriber store front,

537
00:25:39,386 --> 00:25:41,186
and now reading from

538
00:25:41,736 --> 00:25:45,476
We know that users'

539
00:25:45,846 --> 00:25:48,306
and Apple Music subscription

540
00:25:48,306 --> 00:25:50,076
personal and can be identifying.

541
00:25:50,486 --> 00:25:52,486
So we want users to have

542
00:25:52,486 --> 00:25:54,476
which apps get access

543
00:25:55,046 --> 00:25:59,116
Now if your app got access to

544
00:25:59,416 --> 00:26:02,856
you will continue to

545
00:25:59,416 --> 00:26:02,856
you will continue to

546
00:26:02,856 --> 00:26:04,316
So how do you know if

547
00:26:05,836 --> 00:26:07,686
Well with most of

548
00:26:07,686 --> 00:26:10,726
of data we have what's called

549
00:26:10,726 --> 00:26:12,896
It has a little bit

550
00:26:13,076 --> 00:26:15,006
with each protected

551
00:26:15,006 --> 00:26:16,576
But this is the example

552
00:26:17,116 --> 00:26:21,306
So you can call this API and get

553
00:26:22,666 --> 00:26:24,986
If you see notDetermined

554
00:26:24,986 --> 00:26:26,216
from one of two reasons.

555
00:26:26,476 --> 00:26:31,106
Either one, you haven't asked

556
00:26:31,106 --> 00:26:32,806
for access to this

557
00:26:33,076 --> 00:26:35,996
but since then the user has

558
00:26:36,696 --> 00:26:41,316
If you see denied, this means

559
00:26:41,686 --> 00:26:43,226
They do not want your

560
00:26:43,226 --> 00:26:44,576
to a certain protected

561
00:26:44,756 --> 00:26:46,756
And at this point you

562
00:26:47,276 --> 00:26:49,786
You can take the user down a

563
00:26:49,786 --> 00:26:51,856
and show them all the

564
00:26:52,306 --> 00:26:55,166
without giving you access to

565
00:26:55,416 --> 00:26:59,106
Or, you can open up the

566
00:26:59,106 --> 00:27:02,036
And at this point the user

567
00:26:59,106 --> 00:27:02,036
And at this point the user

568
00:27:02,036 --> 00:27:04,386
decision if they so choose.

569
00:27:04,386 --> 00:27:06,666
Now if you see restricted,

570
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:07,806
for one of two reasons.

571
00:27:08,116 --> 00:27:11,366
Either one, there's a parental

572
00:27:11,686 --> 00:27:14,076
saying that your app cannot get

573
00:27:14,076 --> 00:27:17,536
of data, or two, this

574
00:27:17,706 --> 00:27:21,656
maybe it's in an education mode,

575
00:27:21,656 --> 00:27:23,226
And the device administrator

576
00:27:23,226 --> 00:27:25,676
that your app cannot get access

577
00:27:27,096 --> 00:27:31,396
And of course if you see

578
00:27:31,636 --> 00:27:33,296
So we have some other

579
00:27:33,296 --> 00:27:34,716
that also have privacy settings.

580
00:27:35,666 --> 00:27:37,266
Another one is speech

581
00:27:38,016 --> 00:27:41,496
So this allows your app to

582
00:27:41,496 --> 00:27:43,286
to be transcribed into text.

583
00:27:44,036 --> 00:27:46,036
Now the reason that we want

584
00:27:46,036 --> 00:27:48,936
to decide which apps get

585
00:27:48,936 --> 00:27:50,316
because we want them

586
00:27:50,316 --> 00:27:53,376
that if they grant your app

587
00:27:53,376 --> 00:27:54,466
files that are theirs

588
00:27:54,466 --> 00:27:56,746
to be transcribed

589
00:27:57,956 --> 00:28:00,986
You can request access to this

590
00:27:57,956 --> 00:28:00,986
You can request access to this

591
00:28:02,396 --> 00:28:03,896
We also have SiriKit.

592
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:05,886
This is really exciting.

593
00:28:06,176 --> 00:28:08,526
Users can now make

594
00:28:08,776 --> 00:28:11,106
that are completed

595
00:28:12,836 --> 00:28:15,316
But in order for Siri

596
00:28:15,316 --> 00:28:18,466
of request a user might make,

597
00:28:18,466 --> 00:28:20,256
up contextual information

598
00:28:20,256 --> 00:28:22,596
about the user, and

599
00:28:23,346 --> 00:28:25,476
And we want users to have

600
00:28:25,476 --> 00:28:28,206
which apps send up this

601
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:29,646
about them and which don't.

602
00:28:30,236 --> 00:28:33,856
So you need to request

603
00:28:33,856 --> 00:28:35,906
before any Siri requests

604
00:28:36,696 --> 00:28:39,306
And you can do this using the

605
00:28:40,656 --> 00:28:42,126
You also probably heard

606
00:28:42,126 --> 00:28:44,886
about the TV Provider

607
00:28:45,226 --> 00:28:48,476
Now, this allows

608
00:28:48,816 --> 00:28:51,456
to request access to a user's

609
00:28:51,456 --> 00:28:53,286
and sign them into

610
00:28:54,556 --> 00:28:57,186
Now, because this is

611
00:28:57,286 --> 00:28:59,956
reach out to your WWDR partner

612
00:28:59,956 --> 00:29:02,936
in becoming one of these apps.

613
00:28:59,956 --> 00:29:02,936
in becoming one of these apps.

614
00:29:03,186 --> 00:29:06,766
And everything you loved about

615
00:29:06,766 --> 00:29:08,936
as well, and same with HomeKit.

616
00:29:09,516 --> 00:29:14,466
And both of those also have

617
00:29:14,626 --> 00:29:16,996
So, in addition to these

618
00:29:17,296 --> 00:29:20,396
we also have some updates to

619
00:29:20,516 --> 00:29:21,946
to certain protected

620
00:29:22,266 --> 00:29:28,226
So in 2014, we started requiring

621
00:29:28,226 --> 00:29:30,586
to location to declare

622
00:29:30,586 --> 00:29:32,266
and to declare a purpose string.

623
00:29:32,916 --> 00:29:34,726
We find that users

624
00:29:34,726 --> 00:29:36,236
to make the choice

625
00:29:36,476 --> 00:29:39,746
when they understand why an

626
00:29:40,316 --> 00:29:44,526
So, in iOS 10 we

627
00:29:44,526 --> 00:29:46,326
to all protected

628
00:29:47,626 --> 00:29:50,396
So if your app is accessing

629
00:29:50,396 --> 00:29:52,956
of data you will need to

630
00:29:53,186 --> 00:29:56,046
in your app's info

631
00:29:56,046 --> 00:29:57,186
and meaningful purpose string.

632
00:29:58,536 --> 00:30:00,646
So take a moment,

633
00:29:58,536 --> 00:30:00,646
So take a moment,

634
00:30:01,556 --> 00:30:04,686
Think is my app accessing any of

635
00:30:04,686 --> 00:30:07,346
How many of your apps

636
00:30:08,206 --> 00:30:10,066
Yeah. How about two or three?

637
00:30:11,266 --> 00:30:14,236
Okay well you're going to need

638
00:30:14,346 --> 00:30:16,076
in your app's info plist.

639
00:30:16,076 --> 00:30:19,256
And if you're a tvOS developer,

640
00:30:19,256 --> 00:30:21,036
of data are available for

641
00:30:21,036 --> 00:30:24,686
And you'll also need to

642
00:30:24,686 --> 00:30:26,846
in your aps info plist.

643
00:30:26,846 --> 00:30:29,086
Now, I'm going to

644
00:30:29,086 --> 00:30:30,706
of the purpose string

645
00:30:30,816 --> 00:30:33,976
key names that you'll need to

646
00:30:34,046 --> 00:30:35,616
Now, you don't need to

647
00:30:35,616 --> 00:30:36,746
Because they'll be

648
00:30:36,746 --> 00:30:42,026
in the development

649
00:30:42,166 --> 00:30:45,786
So, let's say you have the

650
00:30:46,886 --> 00:30:49,676
The first time a user downloads

651
00:30:49,676 --> 00:30:52,566
through the various features

652
00:30:52,566 --> 00:30:55,026
And then the first

653
00:30:55,026 --> 00:30:57,776
and add their first disco

654
00:30:58,066 --> 00:31:00,916
when it makes sense, your app

655
00:30:58,066 --> 00:31:00,916
when it makes sense, your app

656
00:31:01,406 --> 00:31:05,376
When the timing and the context

657
00:31:05,416 --> 00:31:07,276
the user will see the

658
00:31:07,766 --> 00:31:10,466
And at this point you have

659
00:31:10,466 --> 00:31:12,916
and meaningful purpose string

660
00:31:13,456 --> 00:31:17,876
I'm going to show you now how

661
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:18,986
string using Xcode.

662
00:31:20,596 --> 00:31:24,796
So you go to your app's

663
00:31:26,156 --> 00:31:30,816
custom iOS target

664
00:31:31,526 --> 00:31:32,596
In this case we're going

665
00:31:32,596 --> 00:31:36,076
to choose privacy

666
00:31:36,646 --> 00:31:40,406
And at this point we're

667
00:31:40,406 --> 00:31:41,516
and meaningful purpose string.

668
00:31:41,676 --> 00:31:43,926
So we're going to put

669
00:31:43,926 --> 00:31:46,006
to create disco light

670
00:31:46,926 --> 00:31:49,296
When the context and

671
00:31:49,756 --> 00:31:52,506
the user now sees why we

672
00:31:52,506 --> 00:31:54,446
And they're more likely to

673
00:31:55,166 --> 00:31:56,286
for them.

674
00:31:56,536 --> 00:31:58,226
So, what's going to

675
00:31:58,226 --> 00:32:02,126
if you don't declare

676
00:31:58,226 --> 00:32:02,126
if you don't declare

677
00:32:02,266 --> 00:32:03,426
Well your app's going to crash.

678
00:32:04,446 --> 00:32:09,386
So, to preserve privacy any

679
00:32:09,446 --> 00:32:13,596
that attempts to request access

680
00:32:13,596 --> 00:32:16,586
of data must declare so ahead of

681
00:32:16,586 --> 00:32:21,036
If you don't, your

682
00:32:21,656 --> 00:32:24,186
So, your user will just see

683
00:32:24,626 --> 00:32:27,486
But this is the error that you

684
00:32:28,016 --> 00:32:30,156
It will tell you exactly

685
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:32,616
of data you tried to access

686
00:32:32,616 --> 00:32:33,786
to go add to your info plist.

687
00:32:34,716 --> 00:32:37,656
Now, the reason that we crash

688
00:32:37,656 --> 00:32:40,726
that your app was compromised

689
00:32:40,726 --> 00:32:43,896
for your app to request access

690
00:32:43,896 --> 00:32:46,386
we do not want your

691
00:32:46,386 --> 00:32:48,246
to any data you did

692
00:32:49,586 --> 00:32:52,356
And remember your

693
00:32:52,356 --> 00:32:55,096
for any third party libraries

694
00:32:55,656 --> 00:32:58,026
So be mindful that when

695
00:32:58,406 --> 00:33:00,326
that they do not breech

696
00:32:58,406 --> 00:33:00,326
that they do not breech

697
00:33:00,926 --> 00:33:05,016
So what does this

698
00:33:05,226 --> 00:33:08,896
Well there's some awesome new

699
00:33:09,866 --> 00:33:11,486
And they also have

700
00:33:12,406 --> 00:33:14,516
You need to declare it ahead

701
00:33:14,516 --> 00:33:17,126
to request access to a

702
00:33:17,126 --> 00:33:18,146
in your app's info plist.

703
00:33:18,836 --> 00:33:20,056
And having a clear

704
00:33:20,056 --> 00:33:22,796
and meaningful purpose

705
00:33:22,796 --> 00:33:23,646
better decisions.

706
00:33:25,306 --> 00:33:27,036
So in addition to these

707
00:33:27,156 --> 00:33:31,416
we also have some changes

708
00:33:31,416 --> 00:33:34,696
to help you build in privacy

709
00:33:35,566 --> 00:33:38,316
So first I want to talk about

710
00:33:38,896 --> 00:33:44,486
You can now set the expiration

711
00:33:44,666 --> 00:33:46,306
to any values you put

712
00:33:46,726 --> 00:33:50,906
Setting the expiration time

713
00:33:50,906 --> 00:33:52,596
on the pasteboard

714
00:33:52,826 --> 00:33:54,706
after that date,

715
00:33:55,966 --> 00:33:57,896
And setting the local

716
00:33:57,896 --> 00:34:00,636
will exclude those values

717
00:33:57,896 --> 00:34:00,636
will exclude those values

718
00:34:01,596 --> 00:34:06,256
So here's an example, in

719
00:34:06,926 --> 00:34:08,286
that we're going to

720
00:34:08,466 --> 00:34:09,966
along with the string

721
00:34:10,585 --> 00:34:14,096
We're going to set

722
00:34:14,096 --> 00:34:16,045
to 120 seconds from now.

723
00:34:17,116 --> 00:34:19,306
And we're going to set the

724
00:34:19,985 --> 00:34:22,396
So in two minutes, this

725
00:34:22,396 --> 00:34:23,156
on the pasteboard.

726
00:34:23,806 --> 00:34:27,426
And, these values cannot

727
00:34:27,426 --> 00:34:28,386
universal clipboard.

728
00:34:29,676 --> 00:34:31,446
So why would you

729
00:34:31,505 --> 00:34:32,505
Well, if you know for a fact

730
00:34:33,266 --> 00:34:35,666
that a user is copying

731
00:34:35,666 --> 00:34:39,826
such as a password or a phone

732
00:34:40,255 --> 00:34:42,606
and you don't think it should be

733
00:34:43,106 --> 00:34:44,406
set the expiration time.

734
00:34:45,536 --> 00:34:47,826
And if you don't think it's

735
00:34:47,996 --> 00:34:49,616
to be used in universal

736
00:34:50,235 --> 00:34:51,835
set the local only

737
00:34:53,676 --> 00:34:55,755
We've made a couple more

738
00:34:56,565 --> 00:34:59,136
The first is that all named

739
00:34:59,136 --> 00:35:02,086
to non-persistent and

740
00:34:59,136 --> 00:35:02,086
to non-persistent and

741
00:35:02,216 --> 00:35:04,846
of a pasteboard will cause

742
00:35:06,116 --> 00:35:08,246
In addition, trying

743
00:35:08,246 --> 00:35:10,816
of the find pasteboard will

744
00:35:10,816 --> 00:35:11,506
with no value.

745
00:35:12,896 --> 00:35:14,276
And we really want

746
00:35:14,276 --> 00:35:16,986
to use shared containers

747
00:35:16,986 --> 00:35:19,386
when you're trying to share

748
00:35:19,386 --> 00:35:21,956
on the same device that are

749
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:23,786
It's a much more

750
00:35:24,006 --> 00:35:26,916
than putting items

751
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:30,446
So a lot of your apps also

752
00:35:30,646 --> 00:35:32,106
And we have a couple of

753
00:35:32,106 --> 00:35:34,646
about today as well when you're

754
00:35:34,646 --> 00:35:35,046
into your app.

755
00:35:36,386 --> 00:35:38,936
The first is that every

756
00:35:38,936 --> 00:35:40,966
in an NSUserActivity

757
00:35:41,456 --> 00:35:43,466
You don't want to flood the

758
00:35:43,596 --> 00:35:45,296
that don't make sense

759
00:35:45,686 --> 00:35:47,616
Only really significant

760
00:35:47,616 --> 00:35:48,806
to go look back for later.

761
00:35:49,366 --> 00:35:53,216
And do not set eligibleFor

762
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:55,896
if the data is sensitive

763
00:35:56,616 --> 00:36:02,096
You also probably heard

764
00:35:56,616 --> 00:36:02,096
You also probably heard

765
00:36:02,096 --> 00:36:03,466
for widgets in iOS 10.

766
00:36:04,166 --> 00:36:06,516
So when a user enables

767
00:36:06,516 --> 00:36:09,176
on the home screen,

768
00:36:10,326 --> 00:36:12,676
So because of this,

769
00:36:12,676 --> 00:36:13,526
about some best practices.

770
00:36:13,526 --> 00:36:16,016
Things that you can do when

771
00:36:16,266 --> 00:36:18,476
to remember that they're also

772
00:36:18,476 --> 00:36:22,236
So the first is that you

773
00:36:22,236 --> 00:36:23,386
of data you put in your widget.

774
00:36:24,416 --> 00:36:26,036
If you don't think

775
00:36:26,036 --> 00:36:28,786
on the lock screen, don't

776
00:36:28,786 --> 00:36:30,556
or engineer a way for

777
00:36:30,886 --> 00:36:32,176
when it's on the lock screen.

778
00:36:32,466 --> 00:36:35,886
Make sure that the data is

779
00:36:36,236 --> 00:36:37,886
So when I enable

780
00:36:38,716 --> 00:36:40,866
do I expect to see

781
00:36:41,446 --> 00:36:43,806
How about a month from now?

782
00:36:44,596 --> 00:36:47,056
It's okay if it's not

783
00:36:47,146 --> 00:36:49,676
but I should understand what

784
00:36:51,096 --> 00:36:52,486
And remember that its data

785
00:36:52,486 --> 00:36:54,226
that is file protection

786
00:36:54,476 --> 00:36:56,376
will not be available

787
00:36:56,376 --> 00:37:00,706
So I want to show you an example

788
00:36:56,376 --> 00:37:00,706
So I want to show you an example

789
00:37:00,706 --> 00:37:01,956
with the Find My Friends widget.

790
00:37:03,136 --> 00:37:05,656
On the lock screen the

791
00:37:06,076 --> 00:37:07,106
We know that the location

792
00:37:07,106 --> 00:37:08,916
of your friends is

793
00:37:08,916 --> 00:37:10,936
and should not be

794
00:37:11,306 --> 00:37:14,226
So we have a string that

795
00:37:14,226 --> 00:37:15,996
And the location is not there.

796
00:37:16,756 --> 00:37:18,086
Then once I use touch ID

797
00:37:18,086 --> 00:37:20,586
to unlock my device,

798
00:37:21,856 --> 00:37:24,536
Consider doing something like

799
00:37:24,536 --> 00:37:26,516
of the data in your

800
00:37:31,286 --> 00:37:33,116
So Julien and I talked

801
00:37:33,116 --> 00:37:33,916
of different things today.

802
00:37:35,216 --> 00:37:37,336
We started out by

803
00:37:37,646 --> 00:37:40,236
The real root of how

804
00:37:40,506 --> 00:37:41,806
within your app.

805
00:37:41,806 --> 00:37:44,146
And how you should favor

806
00:37:44,146 --> 00:37:45,586
and OS provided identifiers.

807
00:37:45,586 --> 00:37:50,696
And we talked about how when

808
00:37:50,696 --> 00:37:53,376
to build your features

809
00:37:53,376 --> 00:37:56,586
in privacy friendly ways

810
00:37:56,856 --> 00:37:59,236
or using new technology such

811
00:37:59,766 --> 00:38:04,366
And how when you give users

812
00:37:59,766 --> 00:38:04,366
And how when you give users

813
00:38:04,366 --> 00:38:08,176
over those identifiers and

814
00:38:08,176 --> 00:38:10,646
and you encourage

815
00:38:12,156 --> 00:38:14,626
And that when you let

816
00:38:14,626 --> 00:38:16,966
about their privacy

817
00:38:16,966 --> 00:38:20,866
to make good privacy decisions

818
00:38:20,976 --> 00:38:23,036
And of course we showed you

819
00:38:23,036 --> 00:38:25,156
and some great tools to

820
00:38:25,156 --> 00:38:28,606
into your app from

821
00:38:28,876 --> 00:38:31,136
For more information about

822
00:38:31,136 --> 00:38:31,726
web page.

823
00:38:32,766 --> 00:38:34,436
Here are some related

824
00:38:34,436 --> 00:38:35,336
to check out this week.

825
00:38:36,006 --> 00:38:36,966
Thank you.
