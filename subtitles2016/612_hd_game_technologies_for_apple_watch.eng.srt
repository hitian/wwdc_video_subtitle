00:00:28,156 --> 00:00:29,626
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon and welcome

4
00:00:29,626 --> 00:00:31,736
to Game Technologies

5
00:00:31,816 --> 00:00:35,796
I hope you've had a great WWDC

6
00:00:35,796 --> 00:00:37,856
about all the great

7
00:00:39,596 --> 00:00:43,176
Gaming in iOS has captured

8
00:00:43,756 --> 00:00:47,146
As a longtime gamer, I've

9
00:00:47,146 --> 00:00:49,376
of games created by

10
00:00:49,376 --> 00:00:53,866
We've heard that you're

11
00:00:53,866 --> 00:00:58,436
for games on Apple Watch

12
00:00:58,436 --> 00:01:00,806
to present gaming for watchOS 3.

13
00:00:58,436 --> 00:01:00,806
to present gaming for watchOS 3.

14
00:01:03,196 --> 00:01:07,266
This session covers everything

15
00:01:07,266 --> 00:01:08,836
on this most personal device.

16
00:01:09,036 --> 00:01:12,206
We will first show you

17
00:01:12,206 --> 00:01:15,106
on Apple Watch and provide

18
00:01:15,536 --> 00:01:18,586
We will then introduce you

19
00:01:18,636 --> 00:01:21,326
that allow you to create

20
00:01:22,276 --> 00:01:24,526
In addition we will show you

21
00:01:24,526 --> 00:01:26,386
and multiplayer into your app.

22
00:01:26,946 --> 00:01:29,716
And finally, we will show

23
00:01:29,716 --> 00:01:31,906
to use during development,

24
00:01:31,906 --> 00:01:33,056
of the best practices.

25
00:01:35,016 --> 00:01:38,246
watchOS provides a rich set of

26
00:01:39,106 --> 00:01:41,656
This includes some things

27
00:01:41,656 --> 00:01:43,686
as WatchKit and rich

28
00:01:44,966 --> 00:01:49,376
Today, however, we will

29
00:01:49,606 --> 00:01:52,776
In WatchKit we offer new

30
00:01:52,776 --> 00:01:55,166
to create your game in Xcode

31
00:01:55,776 --> 00:01:58,996
You can now use just your

32
00:01:58,996 --> 00:02:00,816
for precise control

33
00:01:58,996 --> 00:02:00,816
for precise control

34
00:02:01,896 --> 00:02:04,776
There's also haptic feedback

35
00:02:04,776 --> 00:02:09,656
to make your experience much

36
00:02:09,806 --> 00:02:11,706
SpriteKit and SceneKit

37
00:02:11,706 --> 00:02:14,236
that let you create rich

38
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:16,636
They provide good

39
00:02:16,776 --> 00:02:21,046
and form a simple foundation on

40
00:02:21,256 --> 00:02:25,036
Game Center provides API's

41
00:02:25,036 --> 00:02:27,346
to your game including

42
00:02:27,486 --> 00:02:29,386
leaderboards, and multiplayer.

43
00:02:29,946 --> 00:02:34,006
But now let me show an

44
00:02:34,626 --> 00:02:37,346
This is a game built

45
00:02:37,686 --> 00:02:39,076
which is our 3D framework.

46
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:42,636
You start out with a collection

47
00:02:43,956 --> 00:02:45,556
Your goal is to rotate them

48
00:02:45,556 --> 00:02:47,506
until they form a

49
00:02:48,456 --> 00:02:49,826
Now let's watch this

50
00:02:54,756 --> 00:02:56,956
When the player, and now

51
00:02:57,166 --> 00:02:59,526
we're going to play another

52
00:02:59,526 --> 00:03:02,976
about what's happening here.

53
00:02:59,526 --> 00:03:02,976
about what's happening here.

54
00:03:03,546 --> 00:03:07,466
We use pan gestures to control

55
00:03:08,076 --> 00:03:11,426
And when it is in the same plane

56
00:03:11,766 --> 00:03:13,326
to rotate it into

57
00:03:17,476 --> 00:03:20,066
So now that we've introduced

58
00:03:20,216 --> 00:03:22,166
and showed a demo, let's dive

59
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:24,236
into how we can make your

60
00:03:24,236 --> 00:03:26,536
in a much more natural way.

61
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:30,536
Apple Watch is our

62
00:03:31,216 --> 00:03:35,406
We use it up close, usually with

63
00:03:35,586 --> 00:03:36,776
or rotating the crown.

64
00:03:37,496 --> 00:03:39,456
You can read motion

65
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:42,176
or you can even make it

66
00:03:42,706 --> 00:03:46,156
When used together this

67
00:03:46,216 --> 00:03:48,976
that you're using a

68
00:03:49,136 --> 00:03:51,556
and responds in an

69
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:55,276
Let's start with touch.

70
00:03:55,746 --> 00:04:00,076
On watchOS 3 we offer four

71
00:03:55,746 --> 00:04:00,076
On watchOS 3 we offer four

72
00:04:00,076 --> 00:04:01,806
for different kinds of

73
00:04:01,806 --> 00:04:03,456
And I'd like to go

74
00:04:03,876 --> 00:04:06,706
Tap is the simplest.

75
00:04:07,376 --> 00:04:10,126
You touch the screen and

76
00:04:10,126 --> 00:04:12,386
or a position to move to.

77
00:04:13,306 --> 00:04:16,815
Pan is nice scrolling

78
00:04:16,815 --> 00:04:18,106
movement in a given direction.

79
00:04:20,755 --> 00:04:23,886
Swipe is good when you want

80
00:04:24,286 --> 00:04:31,016
such as your inventory menu,

81
00:04:31,206 --> 00:04:36,096
Long press is a recommended way

82
00:04:36,096 --> 00:04:39,456
And here you can provide

83
00:04:39,456 --> 00:04:41,066
or even show Game Center stats.

84
00:04:41,596 --> 00:04:45,706
Now that we've showed

85
00:04:45,706 --> 00:04:48,956
of the four gesture types, let's

86
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:50,186
for you to adopt these.

87
00:04:50,576 --> 00:04:54,276
So for tap, we give you

88
00:04:55,176 --> 00:04:58,096
For pan, WKPan Gesture

89
00:04:58,716 --> 00:05:03,676
And similarly for swipe

90
00:04:58,716 --> 00:05:03,676
And similarly for swipe

91
00:05:04,286 --> 00:05:10,226
Now these gestures are available

92
00:05:10,646 --> 00:05:13,186
When you go into the

93
00:05:13,186 --> 00:05:14,986
for Gesture you'll find

94
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,606
If you select one, you

95
00:05:18,696 --> 00:05:24,516
And in our example we've

96
00:05:24,736 --> 00:05:27,336
These gestures are various

97
00:05:27,456 --> 00:05:31,146
such making it a right swipe,

98
00:05:32,226 --> 00:05:34,946
These other options

99
00:05:35,766 --> 00:05:39,426
Now if you're using multiple

100
00:05:39,426 --> 00:05:41,726
at this last option

101
00:05:41,726 --> 00:05:42,966
to specify the priority.

102
00:05:42,966 --> 00:05:45,156
And this is because

103
00:05:45,256 --> 00:05:47,826
And what do I mean

104
00:05:48,146 --> 00:05:52,366
Well, a right swipe

105
00:05:52,366 --> 00:05:55,416
as a tap followed by a pan.

106
00:05:55,776 --> 00:05:57,986
So you, as the developer,

107
00:05:57,986 --> 00:05:59,956
which of these takes priority.

108
00:06:00,826 --> 00:06:06,166
And in a game a tap and a pan

109
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:07,106
with your game world.

110
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:11,416
And we'd rather have that

111
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:12,786
that would take you

112
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:17,506
So going back to Interface

113
00:06:17,506 --> 00:06:20,346
Fail First field for

114
00:06:20,846 --> 00:06:22,056
And you set tap and pan.

115
00:06:22,056 --> 00:06:24,216
And this reflects our priority.

116
00:06:25,206 --> 00:06:31,226
Now that we've added gestures

117
00:06:31,226 --> 00:06:32,966
to implement an action method.

118
00:06:33,676 --> 00:06:36,256
This action method takes

119
00:06:36,776 --> 00:06:40,816
and there are various properties

120
00:06:40,816 --> 00:06:42,796
location In Object and Bounds.

121
00:06:43,306 --> 00:06:44,576
And this last one, state.

122
00:06:44,576 --> 00:06:48,696
And I think state is best

123
00:06:49,606 --> 00:06:54,296
So from that puzzle app I demoed

124
00:06:54,296 --> 00:06:58,596
And the first thing we do is we

125
00:06:58,996 --> 00:07:02,656
And then we look at the state

126
00:06:58,996 --> 00:07:02,656
And then we look at the state

127
00:07:03,226 --> 00:07:04,636
we're going to set

128
00:07:05,326 --> 00:07:09,136
If we're in the middle of a

129
00:07:09,136 --> 00:07:11,606
or cancelled, we will update it.

130
00:07:13,616 --> 00:07:15,636
So I'd like to finish

131
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:17,096
with some considerations.

132
00:07:18,036 --> 00:07:20,946
Since the user is

133
00:07:20,946 --> 00:07:23,076
of these gestures

134
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,966
so it's a good idea

135
00:07:25,836 --> 00:07:28,946
It's also important to

136
00:07:28,946 --> 00:07:30,176
to our other devices,

137
00:07:30,756 --> 00:07:33,336
your finger is relatively

138
00:07:34,056 --> 00:07:36,506
So please take this into

139
00:07:36,746 --> 00:07:39,096
that content remains visible

140
00:07:40,396 --> 00:07:44,586
And finally, you know, our

141
00:07:45,596 --> 00:07:48,726
it recommends that we make

142
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:53,506
so you should follow them.

143
00:07:53,726 --> 00:07:56,576
Now many of you are probably

144
00:07:56,576 --> 00:07:58,696
but now let's talk about

145
00:07:58,696 --> 00:08:01,956
to Apple Watch and that

146
00:07:58,696 --> 00:08:01,956
to Apple Watch and that

147
00:08:02,856 --> 00:08:04,916
The interface guidelines

148
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:06,756
for selection and scrolling.

149
00:08:07,746 --> 00:08:11,496
But as a gamer, this harkens

150
00:08:11,496 --> 00:08:14,166
with a physical dial

151
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:16,036
to rotate a spaceship

152
00:08:17,006 --> 00:08:21,726
Or in this example we can

153
00:08:22,876 --> 00:08:24,766
until we decide where

154
00:08:24,986 --> 00:08:30,636
And when we're ready we can

155
00:08:30,736 --> 00:08:32,546
Adopting the crown

156
00:08:33,135 --> 00:08:35,496
You access this Crown

157
00:08:35,496 --> 00:08:37,006
on your main interface class

158
00:08:37,256 --> 00:08:39,826
and there are properties

159
00:08:44,216 --> 00:08:47,296
such as rotation per second

160
00:08:47,626 --> 00:08:50,146
Or you can define a delegate.

161
00:08:51,016 --> 00:08:53,136
And this delegate

162
00:08:53,856 --> 00:08:56,566
crownDidRotate which

163
00:08:57,166 --> 00:09:01,496
This rotational Delta represents

164
00:08:57,166 --> 00:09:01,496
This rotational Delta represents

165
00:09:01,496 --> 00:09:03,226
since the last time

166
00:09:03,226 --> 00:09:06,296
And it is positive if it's

167
00:09:06,656 --> 00:09:08,166
and negative if it's

168
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:09,656
And this is true

169
00:09:09,656 --> 00:09:12,006
on the left wrist

170
00:09:12,506 --> 00:09:18,076
When the crown stops rotating

171
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:23,546
So to recap, we think Digital

172
00:09:23,776 --> 00:09:25,276
It's also really easy to adopt.

173
00:09:25,586 --> 00:09:28,556
And I can't wait to see

174
00:09:28,676 --> 00:09:30,306
with this new kind of control.

175
00:09:30,906 --> 00:09:35,906
Now the accelerometer

176
00:09:35,906 --> 00:09:38,366
to enhance other

177
00:09:38,366 --> 00:09:39,996
adding tilt on a

178
00:09:40,966 --> 00:09:43,336
or to add spin to a pool shot.

179
00:09:43,726 --> 00:09:48,496
You access the accelerometer

180
00:09:49,896 --> 00:09:51,416
And there are some

181
00:09:51,886 --> 00:09:56,266
As you probably know,

182
00:09:56,266 --> 00:09:58,516
up here the screen is visible.

183
00:09:58,516 --> 00:10:00,956
But when you lower your arm

184
00:09:58,516 --> 00:10:00,956
But when you lower your arm

185
00:10:01,256 --> 00:10:05,426
When this happens it's going to

186
00:10:06,426 --> 00:10:09,736
So as you move your wrist

187
00:10:10,406 --> 00:10:12,786
so you should account for

188
00:10:12,786 --> 00:10:16,356
And a recommendation here is

189
00:10:17,306 --> 00:10:18,896
You can call the method

190
00:10:18,896 --> 00:10:22,316
in NSProcessInfo performExpiring

191
00:10:23,806 --> 00:10:26,316
to give your game loop

and give your user

193
00:10:29,266 --> 00:10:34,626
Now let's show an example

194
00:10:35,716 --> 00:10:40,056
The first thing we need to do

195
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:43,446

Then in willActivate in

if the accelerometer is visible.

198
00:10:49,636 --> 00:10:54,306
If it is, we configure things

199
00:10:55,056 --> 00:10:56,536
And then we ask the

to our game to give

for games and graphics.

304
00:15:54,206 --> 00:15:56,056
You can use either

345
00:18:16,026 --> 00:18:18,756
that you can automatically

And if you decide

350
00:18:35,096 --> 00:18:38,616
then we will render the scene

351
00:18:38,806 --> 00:18:43,226
So the camera is really the

352

00:18:49,466 --> 00:18:52,446
So now you can move it around

and also apply actions

359
00:19:10,956 --> 00:19:15,146
We also have shape nodes so

360
00:19:15,146 --> 00:19:16,836
and geometric shapes

361
00:19:17,436 --> 00:19:21,426
And we also have

in both SpriteKit and SceneKit.

363
00:19:23,936 --> 00:19:25,786
You can create shaders

364
00:19:26,246 --> 00:19:28,916
and you can create shader

365
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:32,326
to achieve most custom

366
00:19:34,466 --> 00:19:38,946

367
00:19:38,946 --> 00:19:42,506
that you can use, let's

And our scene can

373
00:20:01,836 --> 00:20:04,746
For example, we have

374
00:20:05,556 --> 00:20:07,666
We have SKLight Node

375
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:10,876
And we have SKEmitter Node

We also don't have CIFilters but

380
00:20:32,766 --> 00:20:34,146
with using an SKShader.

381
00:20:37,076 --> 00:20:40,366
We don't have positional audio

382
00:20:40,366 --> 00:20:44,366
like any other platform

383
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:50,466
And finally, we don't

384
00:20:50,636 --> 00:20:54,936
but we can use WKInterface

385
00:21:00,096 --> 00:21:02,986
And this table summarizes the

386
00:21:03,806 --> 00:21:06,196
For SceneKit we almost

387
00:21:06,676 --> 00:21:11,006
Instead of SCNView now we have

388
00:21:12,906 --> 00:21:16,256
We don't have positional audio

389
00:21:17,256 --> 00:21:19,446
And we don't have

390
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:23,156
but we can use Shader Modifiers

391
00:21:26,036 --> 00:21:27,936
So now let's walk

392
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:30,416
of creating a game

393
00:21:30,816 --> 00:21:32,876
for an already existing

394
00:21:37,526 --> 00:21:42,556
And here I am using the

395
00:21:42,616 --> 00:21:45,686
On the left we can

396
00:21:46,176 --> 00:21:48,076
and we can take a look

397
00:21:49,076 --> 00:21:51,976
And we can see here that we are

398
00:21:55,906 --> 00:21:58,416
We can also take a look at

399
00:21:59,716 --> 00:22:04,786
And we can see here that

400
00:21:59,716 --> 00:22:04,786
And we can see here that

401
00:22:04,846 --> 00:22:06,006
to present our scene.

402
00:22:08,416 --> 00:22:11,856
Now to create a game target on

403
00:22:11,936 --> 00:22:13,636
to click File, New Target.

404
00:22:14,826 --> 00:22:19,356
Choose the Game App

405
00:22:19,356 --> 00:22:25,186
Give it a name and

406
00:22:25,786 --> 00:22:33,306
Now this template created two

407
00:22:33,306 --> 00:22:37,806
which contains our storyboard

408
00:22:37,806 --> 00:22:41,146
which contains our Interface

409
00:22:44,576 --> 00:22:46,876
So now let's take a

410
00:22:47,916 --> 00:22:50,476
And this is our storyboard

411
00:22:50,706 --> 00:22:52,796
that we have our interface

412
00:22:52,796 --> 00:22:55,786
And our interface

413
00:22:55,786 --> 00:22:57,086
from our object library.

414
00:22:57,766 --> 00:23:00,096
And here we can see

415
00:22:57,766 --> 00:23:00,096
And here we can see

416
00:23:00,466 --> 00:23:02,516
between choosing

417
00:23:02,516 --> 00:23:05,536
to display SceneKit content

418
00:23:05,536 --> 00:23:07,466
to display SpriteKit content.

419
00:23:10,896 --> 00:23:14,786
Also our interface object

420
00:23:14,786 --> 00:23:17,116
in our Interface

421
00:23:17,116 --> 00:23:18,196
to present our scenes.

422
00:23:19,266 --> 00:23:21,026
So let's take a look at that.

423
00:23:21,156 --> 00:23:25,326
And this is that

424
00:23:27,306 --> 00:23:29,576
And now let's take a

425
00:23:31,196 --> 00:23:34,266
And here we see that we

426
00:23:35,826 --> 00:23:37,856
and in awake(withContext

427
00:23:37,856 --> 00:23:39,926
that we are loading

428
00:23:39,926 --> 00:23:41,366
like the way we do within iOS.

429
00:23:44,096 --> 00:23:46,676
And finally we are using

430
00:23:47,026 --> 00:23:49,466
to present our scene

431
00:23:49,466 --> 00:23:50,586
within an SKView in iOS.

432
00:23:54,736 --> 00:23:57,836
And these are all the steps that

433
00:23:57,836 --> 00:24:00,556
on Apple Watch for an

434
00:23:57,836 --> 00:24:00,556
on Apple Watch for an

435
00:24:03,056 --> 00:24:06,696
And now I'm going to

436
00:24:06,696 --> 00:24:07,976
to go over social gaming.

437
00:24:08,516 --> 00:24:19,406
[ Applause ]

438
00:24:19,906 --> 00:24:20,686
&gt;&gt; Christy Warren:

439
00:24:21,776 --> 00:24:23,306
Now let's talk about

440
00:24:24,886 --> 00:24:28,736
Today games are a lot about

441
00:24:29,106 --> 00:24:30,626
and competition with friends.

442
00:24:32,036 --> 00:24:35,436
Game Center makes it easy to

443
00:24:35,636 --> 00:24:38,596
or even play a game together.

444
00:24:38,666 --> 00:24:42,196
For multiplayer on

445
00:24:42,196 --> 00:24:43,336
on turn-based gaming.

446
00:24:44,756 --> 00:24:45,986
Turn-based gaming is something

447
00:24:45,986 --> 00:24:48,726
that we think is a really

448
00:24:49,496 --> 00:24:54,126
It supports brief

449
00:24:54,126 --> 00:24:55,986
for both players to be present.

450
00:24:56,686 --> 00:25:00,686
I can take a turn and when

451
00:24:56,686 --> 00:25:00,686
I can take a turn and when

452
00:25:01,296 --> 00:25:02,766
You'll get a rich notification

453
00:25:03,586 --> 00:25:05,596
and you may take the

454
00:25:05,596 --> 00:25:10,236
There are various details on how

455
00:25:10,306 --> 00:25:12,136
that we've talked

456
00:25:13,276 --> 00:25:16,846
But today we'll highlight

457
00:25:17,796 --> 00:25:20,756
For other details please

458
00:25:21,546 --> 00:25:22,856
or view past sessions.

459
00:25:23,676 --> 00:25:26,256
I'd also like to call out

460
00:25:26,256 --> 00:25:28,936
for Game Center in iOS 10 that

461
00:25:28,936 --> 00:25:30,806
And if you didn't catch that,

462
00:25:30,806 --> 00:25:32,566
I'd encourage you to

463
00:25:33,186 --> 00:25:38,206
To get started on making

464
00:25:38,206 --> 00:25:39,206
talk authentication.

465
00:25:39,816 --> 00:25:45,106
It is simpler than iOS

466
00:25:45,106 --> 00:25:47,876
to enter a password

467
00:25:48,366 --> 00:25:51,646
When you sign in on the phone

468
00:25:51,646 --> 00:25:53,306
in on Apple Watch.

469
00:25:54,316 --> 00:25:58,056
Also if you're familiar

470
00:25:58,446 --> 00:26:01,076
you may be aware of a View

471
00:25:58,446 --> 00:26:01,076
you may be aware of a View

472
00:26:01,526 --> 00:26:03,786
and you have to present

473
00:26:03,786 --> 00:26:06,606
On iOS -- I mean on Watch

474
00:26:08,716 --> 00:26:10,526
Now let's show this in code.

475
00:26:11,496 --> 00:26:14,566
For those of you not

476
00:26:15,256 --> 00:26:17,616
there is the GKLocal Player

477
00:26:17,616 --> 00:26:19,126
of the focus of our API's.

478
00:26:19,496 --> 00:26:22,196
In this case we sent an

479
00:26:23,156 --> 00:26:24,186
and this gets called

480
00:26:25,106 --> 00:26:28,156
when authentication

481
00:26:28,156 --> 00:26:28,766
or with an error.

482
00:26:28,766 --> 00:26:31,566
If you succeed, you can

483
00:26:31,566 --> 00:26:34,526
if they have signed in and

484
00:26:35,206 --> 00:26:40,336
Now that we've authenticated you

485
00:26:40,776 --> 00:26:43,286
An important decision

486
00:26:43,286 --> 00:26:44,386
up with other players.

487
00:26:44,956 --> 00:26:47,606
Now the easiest way here is

488
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:50,006
to let Game Center pick

489
00:26:50,006 --> 00:26:51,376
and this is called Automatch.

490
00:26:52,376 --> 00:26:55,666
Alternatively, you can load

491
00:26:55,796 --> 00:26:57,256
and invite one programmatically.

492
00:26:58,576 --> 00:26:59,986
So let's start with Automatch.

493
00:27:00,646 --> 00:27:03,206
Here you create a

494
00:27:04,016 --> 00:27:05,826
You pass it to the method find,

495
00:27:06,366 --> 00:27:09,276
the class method find

496
00:27:10,006 --> 00:27:14,036
And when this returns it gives

497
00:27:14,036 --> 00:27:15,566
instance that you can use

498
00:27:15,566 --> 00:27:17,426
to store your data

499
00:27:18,166 --> 00:27:21,946
Now please be aware that

500
00:27:22,836 --> 00:27:25,596
if Norman created a

501
00:27:26,366 --> 00:27:28,736
I may be joining his

502
00:27:28,846 --> 00:27:32,846
So your game needs to take

503
00:27:33,856 --> 00:27:35,326
So let's show this in code.

504
00:27:37,066 --> 00:27:40,696
You create your Match

505
00:27:40,696 --> 00:27:45,426
such as the maximum number of

506
00:27:45,596 --> 00:27:47,486
When that succeeds you

507
00:27:48,296 --> 00:27:49,406
It's really that easy.

508
00:27:49,996 --> 00:27:54,026
And programmatic invites

509
00:27:55,026 --> 00:27:58,516
You just set another parameter

510
00:27:58,676 --> 00:28:01,276
and that is from a list of

511
00:27:58,676 --> 00:28:01,276
and that is from a list of

512
00:28:01,786 --> 00:28:06,056
However, to do this you need

513
00:28:06,256 --> 00:28:07,116
who you can play with.

514
00:28:08,456 --> 00:28:10,676
So I'll show you some

515
00:28:11,816 --> 00:28:14,436
This shows you how to access

516
00:28:14,616 --> 00:28:17,136
And a good place to -- and

517
00:28:17,916 --> 00:28:19,196
There's a player picker

518
00:28:19,196 --> 00:28:20,756
that will let you

519
00:28:21,846 --> 00:28:25,326
So in awake we can call

520
00:28:25,326 --> 00:28:28,306
on the Local Player

521
00:28:28,876 --> 00:28:31,136
And this assumes that you've

522
00:28:31,136 --> 00:28:32,346
in your main interface.

523
00:28:33,546 --> 00:28:36,836
And we call loadRecentPlayers

524
00:28:36,836 --> 00:28:41,096
of players that you, you know,

525
00:28:41,096 --> 00:28:45,396
on phone, or pad, or on

526
00:28:45,646 --> 00:28:50,226
Now it's important to mention

527
00:28:50,226 --> 00:28:54,936
and saved it away you need to

528
00:28:56,756 --> 00:28:59,246
So in order to help you

529
00:28:59,246 --> 00:29:01,926
and give you a head start on

530
00:28:59,246 --> 00:29:01,926
and give you a head start on

531
00:29:02,776 --> 00:29:05,126
we've created a sample

532
00:29:05,126 --> 00:29:07,296
that implements the basics

533
00:29:07,976 --> 00:29:10,096
It's also built on the

534
00:29:10,096 --> 00:29:12,156
And as a bonus it

535
00:29:12,156 --> 00:29:13,586
to use gesture recognizers.

536
00:29:14,416 --> 00:29:16,236
So I'd like to walk

537
00:29:16,426 --> 00:29:18,146
briefly walk through

538
00:29:19,136 --> 00:29:22,696
When you launch the app it

539
00:29:22,736 --> 00:29:23,996
and it says, "Authenticating."

540
00:29:25,106 --> 00:29:28,516
When the authenticate completes

541
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:30,246
on the top and gives you a place

542
00:29:30,246 --> 00:29:31,676
to pick your opponent

543
00:29:32,866 --> 00:29:36,446
This counter in the middle

544
00:29:36,446 --> 00:29:37,736
that you've made

545
00:29:37,736 --> 00:29:39,146
and saves them into

546
00:29:39,146 --> 00:29:40,476
This is just a simple thing

547
00:29:40,796 --> 00:29:43,056
that will save an error

548
00:29:43,956 --> 00:29:46,276
Now if you've tapped Pick

549
00:29:46,856 --> 00:29:48,966
it'll bring up a player

550
00:29:48,966 --> 00:29:50,776
of recent players and

551
00:29:52,066 --> 00:29:53,826
It also gives you the

552
00:29:53,826 --> 00:29:56,406
but in this case I

553
00:29:56,976 --> 00:29:58,646
So now he's playing with me.

554
00:29:59,696 --> 00:30:03,636
If I want to access the list

555
00:29:59,696 --> 00:30:03,636
If I want to access the list

556
00:30:03,796 --> 00:30:05,316
and I'll get the Match Browser.

557
00:30:06,036 --> 00:30:07,946
Here I can create a

558
00:30:08,546 --> 00:30:10,076
or I can pick an existing game.

559
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:11,706
So I'm going to go

560
00:30:12,956 --> 00:30:16,606
And finally, I can end

561
00:30:16,936 --> 00:30:19,756
and that will pass it to Alan

562
00:30:20,356 --> 00:30:23,076
So that's HelloGameKit.

563
00:30:23,586 --> 00:30:25,226
You can download it under

564
00:30:25,226 --> 00:30:26,596
under Session 612.

565
00:30:26,946 --> 00:30:29,186
Click on the Resources

566
00:30:29,806 --> 00:30:34,376
So to recap, Game Center

567
00:30:34,376 --> 00:30:36,896
in watchOS gives you

568
00:30:37,986 --> 00:30:42,476
It is a programmatic API but

569
00:30:42,766 --> 00:30:46,016
that has UI for all the

570
00:30:46,136 --> 00:30:48,176
So we hope that will

571
00:30:49,606 --> 00:30:53,716
So with that I'd like to

572
00:30:53,716 --> 00:30:54,976
about tools and best practices.

575
00:31:02,066 --> 00:31:02,986
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Christy.

576
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:04,026
So now you've been

577
00:31:04,026 --> 00:31:06,106
of the frameworks you have

578
00:31:06,106 --> 00:31:07,446
Let's talk about tools.

579
00:31:07,446 --> 00:31:09,126
Many of you may be

580
00:31:09,126 --> 00:31:11,526
of game tools already

581
00:31:11,526 --> 00:31:12,676
And I'm happy to

582
00:31:12,676 --> 00:31:14,526
of these tools are

583
00:31:14,526 --> 00:31:16,386
for your Apple Watch

584
00:31:17,696 --> 00:31:20,066
This includes our scene

585
00:31:20,066 --> 00:31:22,796
of setting up and laying

586
00:31:22,866 --> 00:31:25,366
and moves it into a visual

587
00:31:26,266 --> 00:31:28,486
So instead of repeatedly

588
00:31:28,486 --> 00:31:30,946
on a positioning of your

589
00:31:30,946 --> 00:31:33,236
and manipulate exactly where

590
00:31:34,006 --> 00:31:35,236
And on top of that you're able

591
00:31:35,236 --> 00:31:36,686
to easily manipulate

592
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:40,296
of your scene using the scene

593
00:31:40,296 --> 00:31:42,386
and modify your physics

594
00:31:42,456 --> 00:31:44,166
all without touching

595
00:31:45,386 --> 00:31:47,726
Now our scene editors

596
00:31:47,726 --> 00:31:48,776
in action editor.

597
00:31:49,196 --> 00:31:51,336
This lets you easily

598
00:31:51,336 --> 00:31:54,576
and preview complex reusable

599
00:31:54,576 --> 00:31:55,266
of your level.

600
00:31:55,266 --> 00:31:57,846
So whether you're creating

601
00:31:57,846 --> 00:32:00,286
to introduce your level

602
00:31:57,846 --> 00:32:00,286
to introduce your level

603
00:32:00,286 --> 00:32:02,536
that you'll be reusing

604
00:32:02,726 --> 00:32:04,916
it's all easily possible

605
00:32:05,476 --> 00:32:08,346
Now as you're developing

606
00:32:08,346 --> 00:32:10,736
to find the powerful particle

607
00:32:10,736 --> 00:32:12,456
and SceneKit are going

608
00:32:12,456 --> 00:32:13,586
in bringing your game to life.

609
00:32:14,346 --> 00:32:15,646
But creating that

610
00:32:15,646 --> 00:32:16,936
for your game can be difficult

611
00:32:16,936 --> 00:32:18,256
if you're not able

612
00:32:18,566 --> 00:32:21,726
And fortunately we provide you

613
00:32:21,726 --> 00:32:23,066
and visualizing your particles.

614
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:25,806
So you're allowed access to

615
00:32:25,806 --> 00:32:27,066
that we have on our particles

616
00:32:27,066 --> 00:32:28,826
so that you can see

617
00:32:28,826 --> 00:32:29,756
as they are changing them.

618
00:32:30,286 --> 00:32:33,906
And we also have tools to help

619
00:32:33,906 --> 00:32:34,666
in Apple Watch.

620
00:32:34,846 --> 00:32:36,326
This includes our

621
00:32:37,036 --> 00:32:38,116
When you place your images

622
00:32:38,116 --> 00:32:40,976
within a Sprite atlas

623
00:32:40,976 --> 00:32:43,176
and reposition them to

624
00:32:43,796 --> 00:32:46,136
This reduces the number of draw

625
00:32:46,136 --> 00:32:47,176
And what's great about this is

626
00:32:47,176 --> 00:32:48,816
that nothing changes

627
00:32:49,246 --> 00:32:51,076
You're still able to

628
00:32:51,076 --> 00:32:52,556
as if they're individual files.

629
00:32:53,186 --> 00:32:56,426
And when your game is running

630
00:32:56,426 --> 00:32:57,376
Performance Gauge.

631
00:32:57,626 --> 00:32:59,566
And at the top of the report

632
00:32:59,566 --> 00:33:00,936
of real-time statistics.

633
00:32:59,566 --> 00:33:00,936
of real-time statistics.

634
00:33:01,486 --> 00:33:02,926
This includes your

635
00:33:03,416 --> 00:33:06,346
as well as your GP

636
00:33:06,346 --> 00:33:07,966
of your GP are being

637
00:33:08,936 --> 00:33:11,626
And your frame time for

638
00:33:11,856 --> 00:33:13,996
And this will help indicate

639
00:33:14,126 --> 00:33:14,966
or GPU bound.

640
00:33:15,386 --> 00:33:18,076
Now in addition to

641
00:33:18,076 --> 00:33:20,056
we also provide you

642
00:33:20,446 --> 00:33:22,666
of our CPU and GPU frame times.

643
00:33:23,186 --> 00:33:24,836
And what's great about

644
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:27,526
down your CPU frame times

645
00:33:27,526 --> 00:33:30,046
so you're able to see

646
00:33:30,046 --> 00:33:31,756
rendering, or running

647
00:33:31,836 --> 00:33:33,446
or evaluating actions

648
00:33:33,686 --> 00:33:35,316
as well as how much

649
00:33:36,246 --> 00:33:40,416
And when your app is paused you

650
00:33:40,416 --> 00:33:43,016
of your app's performance so

651
00:33:43,016 --> 00:33:44,436
as you progress through

652
00:33:45,256 --> 00:33:48,476
And if there's a particular

653
00:33:48,476 --> 00:33:51,536
and examine details on it

654
00:33:52,136 --> 00:33:55,996
So now there's some best

655
00:33:55,996 --> 00:33:56,796
to make sure that you're going

656
00:33:56,796 --> 00:33:58,546
to get great performance

657
00:33:59,256 --> 00:34:02,596
A great way to reduce your

658
00:33:59,256 --> 00:34:02,596
A great way to reduce your

659
00:34:02,596 --> 00:34:04,726
to avoid updating your

660
00:34:05,736 --> 00:34:08,726
Both SpriteKit and SceneKit will

661
00:34:08,726 --> 00:34:10,926
if we detect nothing has

662
00:34:11,985 --> 00:34:14,536
And if you're working with large

663
00:34:14,536 --> 00:34:15,696
at the start of your scenes

664
00:34:15,696 --> 00:34:17,396
but you don't experience

665
00:34:17,396 --> 00:34:19,196
to loading those

666
00:34:19,196 --> 00:34:20,755
of your game you

667
00:34:21,876 --> 00:34:23,876
And you should also aim for

668
00:34:23,876 --> 00:34:26,255
to provide a consistent

669
00:34:26,255 --> 00:34:27,076
And you can do this

670
00:34:27,076 --> 00:34:30,065
by explicitly setting your

671
00:34:30,065 --> 00:34:30,646
per second.

672
00:34:31,826 --> 00:34:34,636
Now if you do find that you're

673
00:34:34,735 --> 00:34:36,735
there's a number of measures

674
00:34:37,076 --> 00:34:39,936
And the first being to reduce

675
00:34:39,936 --> 00:34:41,676
within your scene

676
00:34:42,636 --> 00:34:44,896
You'd also try reducing

677
00:34:44,896 --> 00:34:47,706
that may be far in the

678
00:34:47,706 --> 00:34:50,786
And what' great about this is

679
00:34:50,786 --> 00:34:53,286
in your game's visual fidelity

680
00:34:53,735 --> 00:34:55,186
And if you're still

681
00:34:55,446 --> 00:34:57,706
try reducing the complexity

682
00:34:57,706 --> 00:35:00,196
that right balance between

683
00:34:57,706 --> 00:35:00,196
that right balance between

684
00:35:00,196 --> 00:35:03,446
Now as you're developing

685
00:35:03,446 --> 00:35:04,946
on Apple Watch there's a number

686
00:35:04,946 --> 00:35:06,516
of design considerations

687
00:35:06,516 --> 00:35:07,816
in mind throughout

688
00:35:08,436 --> 00:35:11,446
Apple Watch, you shouldn't

689
00:35:11,446 --> 00:35:13,036
experience and scaling it down.

690
00:35:13,036 --> 00:35:15,006
We want you to be

691
00:35:15,456 --> 00:35:17,056
And the Apple Watch

692
00:35:17,056 --> 00:35:18,426
to lightweight interactions.

693
00:35:18,766 --> 00:35:20,536
Users love to be able

694
00:35:20,536 --> 00:35:21,646
of their game at a glance.

695
00:35:21,646 --> 00:35:23,156
And you should be

696
00:35:23,156 --> 00:35:24,466
around someone who is on the go.

697
00:35:26,126 --> 00:35:28,666
In addition, you're going to

698
00:35:28,666 --> 00:35:31,356
and simple, and should avoid

699
00:35:31,356 --> 00:35:33,226
or being too busy on

700
00:35:33,766 --> 00:35:35,476
You may even want to

701
00:35:35,476 --> 00:35:37,756
across multiple screens so

702
00:35:37,756 --> 00:35:38,536
screen space.

703
00:35:39,276 --> 00:35:41,916
And if you have any

704
00:35:41,916 --> 00:35:42,876
make sure they're large enough

705
00:35:42,876 --> 00:35:45,066
so that your users can

706
00:35:45,586 --> 00:35:47,856
And you should also aim

707
00:35:47,856 --> 00:35:49,936
to maintain visual

708
00:35:50,156 --> 00:35:52,156
What that means is

709
00:35:52,156 --> 00:35:54,976
into yours should feel like

710
00:35:55,386 --> 00:35:57,376
And part of that can be

711
00:35:57,376 --> 00:36:00,036
that supports your game's brand

712
00:35:57,376 --> 00:36:00,036
that supports your game's brand

713
00:36:01,276 --> 00:36:04,306
Now we also recommend that

714
00:36:04,306 --> 00:36:05,326
background for your game.

715
00:36:05,326 --> 00:36:06,426
And what's great about this is

716
00:36:06,426 --> 00:36:08,066
that the black will

717
00:36:08,066 --> 00:36:10,896
with Apple Watch's bezel and

718
00:36:10,896 --> 00:36:12,346
of having an edgeless screen.

719
00:36:12,916 --> 00:36:16,016
So now you've been

720
00:36:16,016 --> 00:36:18,596
of the awesome input you have

721
00:36:18,596 --> 00:36:20,586
and the great frameworks

722
00:36:20,586 --> 00:36:23,986
to develop your game, and a rich

723
00:36:23,986 --> 00:36:25,256
for your development workflow.

724
00:36:25,606 --> 00:36:27,396
We can't wait to see

725
00:36:27,396 --> 00:36:29,876

So if you want to dive

734
00:36:51,216 --> 00:36:52,176
that we touched on today,

735
00:36:52,606 --> 00:36:54,276
we highly recommend you

736
00:36:55,286 --> 00:36:56,826
