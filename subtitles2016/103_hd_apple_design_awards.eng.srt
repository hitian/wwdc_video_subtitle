&gt;&gt; Hello, developers.

3
00:00:37,356 --> 00:00:38,806
What a great venue.

4
00:00:39,176 --> 00:00:40,436
This is really great.

5
00:00:40,586 --> 00:00:41,956
Thanks for coming today.

6
00:00:41,956 --> 00:00:45,236
It's been a long day, but we've

7
00:00:45,236 --> 00:00:45,636
for you.

8
00:00:46,086 --> 00:00:47,266
So I want to welcome you

9
00:00:47,266 --> 00:00:50,896
to the 15th Apple

10
00:00:51,326 --> 00:00:54,266
And we've got a ton of

11
00:00:54,576 --> 00:00:58,146
And we'd like to, of course,

12
00:00:58,806 --> 00:01:02,136
The Apple Design Awards are all

13
00:00:58,806 --> 00:01:02,136
The Apple Design Awards are all

14
00:01:02,136 --> 00:01:03,636
by people in this community.

15
00:01:03,826 --> 00:01:08,556
And this is the moment when many

16
00:01:08,666 --> 00:01:10,716
some of you get to take home one

17
00:01:10,716 --> 00:01:12,196
of the Apple Design

18
00:01:12,586 --> 00:01:15,536
which everyone wants one.

19
00:01:15,656 --> 00:01:18,596
And so we'll see who

20
00:01:19,566 --> 00:01:22,026
But to start things off, I

21
00:01:22,026 --> 00:01:25,086
of context for the apps that

22
00:01:26,156 --> 00:01:29,386
The App Store opened

23
00:01:29,386 --> 00:01:32,636
In fact, next month it'll

24
00:01:32,636 --> 00:01:35,126
And it was on July 10th of 2008.

25
00:01:35,236 --> 00:01:39,556
And in those eight

26
00:01:39,556 --> 00:01:40,496
Right? They've taken off.

27
00:01:40,496 --> 00:01:43,126
And today, we heard 2

28
00:01:43,126 --> 00:01:45,556
But if we just go

29
00:01:45,556 --> 00:01:48,736
to those first days,

30
00:01:48,736 --> 00:01:51,366
I mean, it all started off

31
00:01:51,366 --> 00:01:54,496
And we all remember

32
00:01:55,146 --> 00:01:56,706
They were 30-second slots.

33
00:01:57,446 --> 00:01:59,636
And in those 30-second

34
00:01:59,636 --> 00:02:01,316
or six apps that were featured.

35
00:01:59,636 --> 00:02:01,316
or six apps that were featured.

36
00:02:02,156 --> 00:02:05,436
And so each app had five

37
00:02:05,436 --> 00:02:07,766
the customer -- with

38
00:02:08,726 --> 00:02:10,446
And to make an impression

39
00:02:10,645 --> 00:02:12,556
in five seconds is

40
00:02:12,556 --> 00:02:18,016
But what happened in those ads

41
00:02:18,016 --> 00:02:20,286
and they would stop

42
00:02:20,286 --> 00:02:22,626
and they would pay attention to

43
00:02:22,626 --> 00:02:23,866
And within five seconds,

44
00:02:23,866 --> 00:02:25,746
they would have decided

45
00:02:25,746 --> 00:02:28,816
and if they were going to go

46
00:02:28,816 --> 00:02:30,266
And I think that's

47
00:02:30,266 --> 00:02:34,826
And those apps -- basically, it

48
00:02:35,026 --> 00:02:38,356
that created the phrase,

49
00:02:38,356 --> 00:02:39,796
And that phrase was born.

50
00:02:40,376 --> 00:02:43,086
And it was during

51
00:02:43,086 --> 00:02:45,286
on that we saw enormous

52
00:02:45,286 --> 00:02:47,646
I mean, we didn't have

53
00:02:47,756 --> 00:02:48,476
iPhone was out.

54
00:02:48,476 --> 00:02:49,946
We had this SDK.

55
00:02:49,946 --> 00:02:51,106
We didn't have that before.

56
00:02:51,106 --> 00:02:52,856
And we saw enormous creativity.

57
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,996
We saw great games,

58
00:02:55,996 --> 00:02:57,806
and very valuable utilities,

59
00:02:58,086 --> 00:03:00,536
some pretty incredible

60
00:02:58,086 --> 00:03:00,536
some pretty incredible

61
00:03:00,976 --> 00:03:03,086
and lots of other great stuff,

62
00:03:03,086 --> 00:03:05,056
much of which was

63
00:03:05,606 --> 00:03:11,166
And then, two years later,

64
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:13,376
And it was introduced

65
00:03:13,376 --> 00:03:15,486
at the Yerba Buena

66
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:16,936
And I remember that day.

67
00:03:16,936 --> 00:03:18,656
It was an incredible day.

68
00:03:19,156 --> 00:03:22,106
But when the iPad

69
00:03:22,306 --> 00:03:24,606
it brought a whole

70
00:03:25,116 --> 00:03:28,376
And these were apps that

71
00:03:28,376 --> 00:03:32,186
I mean these were apps that,

72
00:03:32,186 --> 00:03:35,186
they caused us to

73
00:03:35,546 --> 00:03:36,846
at what could be

74
00:03:36,846 --> 00:03:39,816
And then we had universal

75
00:03:39,816 --> 00:03:42,576
and bringing functionality

76
00:03:42,576 --> 00:03:44,816
and the experience of all

77
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:50,646
And all of these apps early on

78
00:03:51,196 --> 00:03:53,936
They changed the way that

79
00:03:54,376 --> 00:03:57,166
They changed the way that we

80
00:03:57,166 --> 00:04:00,556
that we worked, and that

81
00:03:57,166 --> 00:04:00,556
that we worked, and that

82
00:04:00,556 --> 00:04:01,536
things done.

83
00:04:02,376 --> 00:04:04,336
These were transformational

84
00:04:05,226 --> 00:04:06,286
And then more recently,

85
00:04:06,286 --> 00:04:10,436
Apple Watch was introduced,

86
00:04:10,436 --> 00:04:13,526
And with each of these, we

87
00:04:15,106 --> 00:04:17,266
And so now, as you've

88
00:04:17,576 --> 00:04:20,016
we've got four platforms

89
00:04:20,616 --> 00:04:21,896
And this is amazing.

90
00:04:22,196 --> 00:04:24,836
I mean, for me, being

91
00:04:24,836 --> 00:04:26,496
I remember when it

92
00:04:26,806 --> 00:04:29,246
and there was some

93
00:04:29,886 --> 00:04:34,776
And then everything took

94
00:04:34,776 --> 00:04:36,416
of that whole ecosystem.

95
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:39,046
And there's a tremendous

96
00:04:39,246 --> 00:04:40,746
with these four platforms.

97
00:04:41,136 --> 00:04:43,776

98
00:04:43,776 --> 00:04:46,036
from developers on

00:04:46,656 --> 00:04:48,556
and a few of those will

100
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:53,156

101
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:57,216

in technology adoption.

106

or ever heard me speak, you know

108

As part of the scholarship

134
00:06:29,516 --> 00:06:32,506
they had to submit an app that

135
00:06:32,506 --> 00:06:35,156
for the scholarship

136
00:06:35,156 --> 00:06:37,066
or they could just

137

138
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:41,036
that was already

139
00:06:41,036 --> 00:06:42,576

All right, so Joaquin

149
00:07:25,776 --> 00:07:29,106
after he had applied for a

150
00:07:29,106 --> 00:07:30,426
and that hadn't worked out.

151
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:32,976
And he decided after

152
00:07:33,466 --> 00:07:35,676
he could just do

153
00:07:35,796 --> 00:07:37,536
He didn't need to work

154
00:07:37,656 --> 00:07:41,846
So he decided to write his own

155
00:07:42,146 --> 00:07:45,556
And I'd like to show

156
00:07:45,676 --> 00:07:47,546

157

194
00:09:33,366 --> 00:09:37,676
And at RIT, they went to an iOS

195
00:09:37,676 --> 00:09:38,146
this year.

196
00:09:38,146 --> 00:09:39,106
And it was at that event

197
00:09:39,106 --> 00:09:41,906
that they started

198
00:09:41,906 --> 00:09:43,656
And Josh is the programmer.

Patrick is the designer.

And Erik is the guy who created

204
00:09:51,226 --> 00:09:53,826
but also kind of kept you

205
00:09:53,826 --> 00:09:55,126
in terms of development.

206
00:09:55,356 --> 00:10:00,166

So let me just show you

208
00:10:00,216 --> 00:10:05,516
So Dividr is this fun and

209
00:10:05,516 --> 00:10:09,046
And it makes use of 3D

210
00:10:09,316 --> 00:10:13,856
to move the control

211
00:10:13,856 --> 00:10:15,606
on the pressure that

212
00:10:15,896 --> 00:10:18,086
So the more pressure you

213
00:10:18,316 --> 00:10:20,316
The lighter on you are,

214
00:10:20,426 --> 00:10:24,546
And you're basically avoiding

215
00:10:25,026 --> 00:10:27,696
It's simple and compelling,

The first Apple Design

All right, so Frame.io is a

250
00:12:05,736 --> 00:12:08,126
for teens working

251
00:12:08,126 --> 00:12:12,886
And it lets these teens easily

253
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:19,296
in that creative pro workflow.

And it turns out that it's

255
00:12:24,306 --> 00:12:28,116
And Frame.io nails it

256
00:12:28,116 --> 00:12:32,036

I'd like to ask Michael

00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:38,746
&gt;&gt; Thank you, John.

260
00:12:39,296 --> 00:12:42,296
So this is a typical

261
00:12:42,296 --> 00:12:45,496
Now it's really media-centric,

262
00:12:45,496 --> 00:12:47,576
in the lower half of the view.

263
00:12:48,046 --> 00:12:48,726
Now -- whoops.

264
00:12:50,286 --> 00:12:54,296
So basically what they've

265
00:12:54,296 --> 00:12:57,626
UICollectionViewFlowLayout

266
00:12:57,946 --> 00:13:00,386
and that really makes

267
00:12:57,946 --> 00:13:00,386
and that really makes

268
00:13:00,386 --> 00:13:03,816
Now at the top, you can see

269
00:13:04,266 --> 00:13:07,086
Now this is a really fun

270
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:10,286
And that's really cool,

271
00:13:10,286 --> 00:13:10,716
There we go.

272
00:13:10,776 --> 00:13:12,696
And that's using core animation

273
00:13:12,696 --> 00:13:14,076
with custom curves

274
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:17,006
That opens up to a table

275
00:13:17,326 --> 00:13:20,726
to remove someone from a project

276
00:13:21,956 --> 00:13:25,556
Now the media player is

277
00:13:26,046 --> 00:13:28,696
And so what they've done here

278
00:13:29,446 --> 00:13:30,956
and they've done this in a

279
00:13:31,236 --> 00:13:33,126
The first one is a feature

280
00:13:33,126 --> 00:13:37,986
So on this clip of this mountain

281
00:13:38,126 --> 00:13:40,046
across this clip very lightly.

282
00:13:40,046 --> 00:13:41,176
And you can see I

283
00:13:41,176 --> 00:13:42,536
of the clip really quickly.

284
00:13:43,196 --> 00:13:45,036
Now the other thing that they've

285
00:13:45,036 --> 00:13:46,246
and implemented peak and pop.

286
00:13:46,396 --> 00:13:48,636
So on this clip, I'm

287
00:13:48,756 --> 00:13:49,486
That peaks in.

288
00:13:49,936 --> 00:13:50,896
And now watch this.

289
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:53,766
When I pop, it goes

290
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:55,546
into a new view --

291
00:13:55,546 --> 00:13:56,556
Pretty cool stuff.

292
00:13:57,416 --> 00:13:59,236
Now the Comment View is

00:13:59,236 --> 00:14:01,666
where all the project

294
00:13:59,236 --> 00:14:01,666
where all the project

295
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:02,786
and actually collaborate.

296
00:14:03,126 --> 00:14:04,976
All these comments

297
00:14:04,976 --> 00:14:07,956
So when I touch something,

298
00:14:07,956 --> 00:14:08,956
where the comment was made.

299
00:14:09,386 --> 00:14:12,326
You'll also notice that all

300
00:14:12,326 --> 00:14:13,026
to a Play button.

301
00:14:13,026 --> 00:14:15,556
So for example, here you

302
00:14:15,556 --> 00:14:17,696
If I touch the Play

303
00:14:17,696 --> 00:14:20,316
that they call Comment Replay

00:14:20,316 --> 00:14:22,536

305
00:14:22,536 --> 00:14:23,766
and two seconds after.

306

307
00:14:28,016 --> 00:14:29,216
and the phone will vibrate.

312
00:14:38,136 --> 00:14:39,886

00:26:39,016 --> 00:26:40,906
for the calendar view here.

I've decided not to practice.

this is a summary

And you can see that

And you can see that

00:27:01,526 --> 00:27:03,416
on a streak of 15 days.

Now when I was outside earlier,

586
00:27:15,326 --> 00:27:21,336
I was reading the iOS 10

including one that is

00:27:35,226 --> 00:27:38,756
It's based on a dotted

00:27:38,756 --> 00:27:42,366
like the iPhone app so that

594
00:27:42,366 --> 00:27:43,636
at how the dots are arranged

595
00:27:44,006 --> 00:27:46,106
and which ones are

596
00:27:46,106 --> 00:27:47,606

00:27:48,806 --> 00:27:53,426
Streaks uses Watch connectivity

Now Streaks is also considerate,

Now Streaks is also considerate,

601
00:28:01,756 --> 00:28:05,316
especially in the way it

602
00:28:06,516 --> 00:28:13,096
For instance, when it comes

603
00:28:14,096 --> 00:28:17,766
Auzuki, Streaks knows that

604
00:28:17,766 --> 00:28:19,416
when I come home from

605
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:21,036
otherwise she gets quite cranky.

606
00:28:21,036 --> 00:28:22,916
And nobody wants a cranky cat.

607
00:28:23,606 --> 00:28:27,966
So it knows to remind me

608
00:28:27,966 --> 00:28:31,116
but 30 minutes in advance of

609
00:28:31,116 --> 00:28:32,716
that streak and have

610
00:28:32,826 --> 00:28:33,536
All right?

611
00:28:33,986 --> 00:28:37,596
And it also looks at

612
00:28:37,596 --> 00:28:39,866
out when it is I

613
00:28:39,866 --> 00:28:44,476
so that it doesn't send me a

For when things are

615
00:28:48,496 --> 00:28:50,176
you get encouragement as well.

616
00:28:50,176 --> 00:28:53,846
And in addition to that, Streaks

617
00:28:53,846 --> 00:28:56,706
goal so that you achieve

618
00:28:57,426 --> 00:28:59,926
Now, conversely, if you've

it will suggest an

so you don't end up giving up.

622
00:29:10,266 --> 00:29:14,026
OK, so Streaks is

623
00:29:14,026 --> 00:29:16,346
It's exclusive to iOS and Watch,

624
00:29:17,136 --> 00:29:19,266
and it was developed

To move Lara to the next space,

But, OK, so let's start

685
00:32:23,276 --> 00:32:25,256
Obviously there's this

00:32:25,256 --> 00:32:27,556
that if I step on

00:32:27,796 --> 00:32:31,936

00:43:59,416 --> 00:44:01,996
and in so many ways

944
00:44:01,996 --> 00:44:03,266
and considered them deeply.

945
00:44:03,436 --> 00:44:06,146
And it's really great

946
00:44:06,146 --> 00:44:08,526
In fact, we like this app so

947
00:44:08,526 --> 00:44:12,896
on the roadshow this fall --

948
00:44:12,896 --> 00:44:15,256
and we used it as one

949
00:44:15,256 --> 00:44:16,556
in our design sessions.

950
00:44:17,096 --> 00:44:19,726
And we'd like to

951
00:44:19,776 --> 00:44:20,016
So, TC?

952
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:21,026
&gt;&gt; Thanks again, John.

953
00:44:22,016 --> 00:44:24,536
Zova is a fitness app

954
00:44:24,536 --> 00:44:26,466
achievable, daily exercises.

955
00:44:26,986 --> 00:44:29,306
Now this team here

956
00:44:29,306 --> 00:44:33,526
of Apple technologies from day

957
00:44:33,526 --> 00:44:35,416
of the app and HealthKit

958
00:44:35,996 --> 00:44:40,506
to then Apple Watch support, and

959
00:44:40,506 --> 00:44:42,936
But they don't just

960
00:44:43,836 --> 00:44:47,406
They only deliver on

961
00:44:47,446 --> 00:44:49,826
to each platform

962
00:44:50,566 --> 00:44:52,866
as if it always meant

963
00:44:53,246 --> 00:44:56,556
And today, we'd like to

964
00:44:57,116 --> 00:45:01,866
So with Apple TV, they didn't

965
00:44:57,116 --> 00:45:01,866
So with Apple TV, they didn't

966
00:45:02,696 --> 00:45:06,046
They took the Apple TV

967
00:45:06,046 --> 00:45:08,806
about the whole medium of TV.

968
00:45:09,936 --> 00:45:11,576
TV is a major part of our lives.

969
00:45:12,086 --> 00:45:16,396
It's when we gather together to

970
00:45:17,666 --> 00:45:21,466
Now workout apps don't have to

971
00:45:22,006 --> 00:45:25,006
With the communal experiences

972
00:45:25,246 --> 00:45:28,846
Zova had to think about the kind

973
00:45:29,486 --> 00:45:32,416
This collection here called

974
00:45:32,416 --> 00:45:35,136
up with your friend and

975
00:45:35,306 --> 00:45:37,206
and get fit together.

976
00:45:38,936 --> 00:45:42,686
But Zova didn't just stop

977
00:45:43,466 --> 00:45:46,156
They also wanted to take full

978
00:45:46,786 --> 00:45:49,486
As you will see me

979
00:45:49,486 --> 00:45:51,866
as you would expect, very

980
00:45:53,576 --> 00:45:56,346
And focusing on elements

981
00:45:56,346 --> 00:45:58,616
Let's go into this workout here.

982
00:45:59,336 --> 00:46:02,146
So, here, you get

983
00:45:59,336 --> 00:46:02,146
So, here, you get

984
00:46:02,146 --> 00:46:03,586
of what this workout is about.

985
00:46:03,586 --> 00:46:06,146
And also, if you have

986
00:46:06,256 --> 00:46:07,776
these are video previews

987
00:46:08,026 --> 00:46:10,616
of exactly what the

988
00:46:11,526 --> 00:46:14,286
That way, you know what

989
00:46:14,286 --> 00:46:16,666
But where the implementation

990
00:46:16,666 --> 00:46:19,486
into its own is when you're

991
00:46:19,826 --> 00:46:20,856
So let's try one of these.

992
00:46:28,436 --> 00:46:31,226
Each workout starts with a

993
00:46:31,226 --> 00:46:32,906
of exactly what the exercise is.

994
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:43,196
Now I've just pressed the

995
00:46:43,196 --> 00:46:45,546
as you would expect because

996
00:46:45,546 --> 00:46:46,556
when you're trying to exercise.

997
00:46:46,556 --> 00:46:47,486
That's just the way it is.

998
00:46:48,046 --> 00:46:50,476
When you resume the pause,

999
00:46:50,476 --> 00:46:52,676
so that you can actually

1000
00:46:52,676 --> 00:46:54,216
of just jumping straight

1001
00:46:55,146 --> 00:46:58,456
But where it gets really

1002
00:46:58,456 --> 00:47:02,026
and holding onto the Pause

1003
00:46:58,456 --> 00:47:02,026
and holding onto the Pause

1004
00:47:02,026 --> 00:47:05,626
with a freeze frame so that

1005
00:47:05,626 --> 00:47:06,996
at the details on the screen --

1006
00:47:07,266 --> 00:47:10,566
perhaps the exact

1007
00:47:11,116 --> 00:47:14,326
Now this is possible and is

1008
00:47:14,326 --> 00:47:18,046
because Zova has implemented

1009
00:47:20,046 --> 00:47:22,396
Similarly, if I was

1010
00:47:22,626 --> 00:47:25,616
I can restart an

1011
00:47:26,196 --> 00:47:32,376
Or, if I was to swipe

1012
00:47:32,376 --> 00:47:33,976
you can see I can easily skip.

1013
00:47:41,046 --> 00:47:43,046
Now you may have noticed

1014
00:47:43,046 --> 00:47:43,836
to Apple Watch.

1015
00:47:44,536 --> 00:47:47,216
This is really neat.

1016
00:47:47,426 --> 00:47:49,946
What's happening here is

1017
00:47:49,946 --> 00:47:50,626
from my Watch.

1018
00:47:50,956 --> 00:47:55,746
And through HealthKit and

1019
00:47:55,746 --> 00:47:57,846
that onto the live

1020
00:47:57,846 --> 00:47:59,376
So that's my heartrate

1021
00:48:03,326 --> 00:48:04,246
Let's move along then.

1022
00:48:07,506 --> 00:48:11,586
At the end of each workout, you

1023
00:48:11,586 --> 00:48:13,816
log your feedback as

1024
00:48:14,196 --> 00:48:16,346
And this is a really fun

1025
00:48:16,346 --> 00:48:19,896
You can either give it a big

1026
00:48:20,196 --> 00:48:21,776
or if it's gone less well --

1027
00:48:21,776 --> 00:48:27,406
and in my case, I tend to

1028
00:48:27,406 --> 00:48:27,976
So there you go.

[ Music ]

1046
00:49:35,046 --> 00:49:37,646
So Ulysses is a powerful

1047
00:49:37,646 --> 00:49:40,286
of all kinds -- journalists,

1048
00:49:40,336 --> 00:49:44,116
And it's designed specifically

1049
00:49:44,116 --> 00:49:45,286
of the writing process.

1050
00:49:45,286 --> 00:49:47,376
And we picked it as a winner

1051
00:49:47,376 --> 00:49:49,736
because it's a tool

1052
00:49:49,736 --> 00:49:51,786
for writing without distraction.

1053
00:49:52,106 --> 00:49:54,936
The entire UI of the

1054
00:49:54,936 --> 00:49:57,116

And the execution of

1056
00:49:57,716 --> 00:50:00,336
And the execution of

1057
00:50:00,336 --> 00:50:03,076
It allows you to work

1058
00:50:03,456 --> 00:50:06,436
You can choose to start on

1059
00:50:06,856 --> 00:50:09,016
then move to iPhone,

1060
00:50:09,016 --> 00:50:11,596
And you get that

1061
00:50:11,656 --> 00:50:13,356
on any of those devices.

1062
00:50:13,956 --> 00:50:16,626
And to show this app to you, I'd

1063
00:50:17,556 --> 00:50:18,076
&gt;&gt; Thank you, John.

1064
00:50:18,676 --> 00:50:20,586
So Ulysses is a focused

1065
00:50:20,586 --> 00:50:22,806
and distraction-free

1066
00:50:23,396 --> 00:50:26,416
It has the power of

1067
00:50:26,416 --> 00:50:29,176
with flexible organization

1068
00:50:29,176 --> 00:50:32,926
Now it's a super clean writing

1069
00:50:32,926 --> 00:50:34,316
to help you through the task.

1070
00:50:34,756 --> 00:50:36,066
So the first thing, for example,

1071
00:50:36,476 --> 00:50:38,836
is I can highlight

1072
00:50:38,836 --> 00:50:40,596
That should look familiar.

1073
00:50:41,266 --> 00:50:44,136
We can also show

1074
00:50:45,266 --> 00:50:47,616
Now Ulysses is based

1075
00:50:48,066 --> 00:50:49,236
And what Markdown is --

1076
00:50:49,796 --> 00:50:52,236
it's a markup language

1077
00:50:52,236 --> 00:50:54,196
and special characters

1078
00:50:54,476 --> 00:50:57,066
So, for example, here you

1079
00:50:57,066 --> 00:50:59,006
of the Apple TV human

1080
00:50:59,796 --> 00:51:02,186
that navigation has

1081
00:50:59,796 --> 00:51:02,186
that navigation has

1082
00:51:02,186 --> 00:51:03,956
and that is a second-level

1083
00:51:04,406 --> 00:51:08,486
By the way, this tear-off menu

1084
00:51:09,156 --> 00:51:13,056
Now Ulysses also presents images

1085
00:51:13,056 --> 00:51:14,996
and vey distraction-free way.

1086
00:51:16,636 --> 00:51:19,536
Now Ulysses is really

1087
00:51:19,536 --> 00:51:21,636
For me, for example, I

1088
00:51:21,636 --> 00:51:24,926
I get creative after

1089
00:51:25,166 --> 00:51:26,726
If Dark Mode doesn't

1090
00:51:27,076 --> 00:51:30,196
there are customizable themes,

1091
00:51:30,196 --> 00:51:31,686
from the Ulysses User Community.

1092
00:51:32,206 --> 00:51:34,696
Now Markdown is an open

1093
00:51:34,736 --> 00:51:36,656
with a number of different

1094
00:51:36,656 --> 00:51:38,196
or you can create your own.

1095
00:51:38,486 --> 00:51:40,046
Both custom markdown definitions

1096
00:51:40,126 --> 00:51:43,926
and custom themes are all

1097
00:51:45,256 --> 00:51:51,956
OK. Now this is a modern,

1098
00:51:52,366 --> 00:51:54,066
So if you take a look all

1099
00:51:54,066 --> 00:51:55,286
that's my library column.

1100
00:51:55,286 --> 00:51:56,266
And in my library column,

1101
00:51:56,266 --> 00:51:57,946
that's where I manage

1102
00:51:58,316 --> 00:52:02,196
For example, here I have a

1103
00:51:58,316 --> 00:52:02,196
For example, here I have a

1104
00:52:02,196 --> 00:52:04,466
I also have filters.

1105
00:52:04,466 --> 00:52:07,316
Now a filter is sort

1106
00:52:07,406 --> 00:52:09,796
So here, for example, I'm

1107
00:52:09,796 --> 00:52:10,776
or the name "Ishmael".

1108
00:52:11,136 --> 00:52:13,616
And all of the occurrences

1109
00:52:13,616 --> 00:52:14,646
from the book "Moby Dick".

1110
00:52:14,646 --> 00:52:16,426
And I can also change the icon

1111
00:52:16,426 --> 00:52:17,836
to something a little

1112
00:52:18,696 --> 00:52:20,826
I can also do ad hoc searches.

1113
00:52:21,566 --> 00:52:25,916
So, for example, I know that

1114
00:52:25,916 --> 00:52:27,756
of the word "galleon"

1115
00:52:27,756 --> 00:52:28,416
And if I take a look

1116
00:52:28,416 --> 00:52:31,266
at the search base using

1117
00:52:31,546 --> 00:52:35,006
I can see that I just searched

1118
00:52:35,356 --> 00:52:36,946
most of those written

1119
00:52:37,326 --> 00:52:39,916
And that's thanks to their

1120
00:52:39,916 --> 00:52:41,376
and Grand Central Dispatch.

1121
00:52:42,216 --> 00:52:44,336
Okie dokie.

1122
00:52:45,386 --> 00:52:49,416
So let's go back here.

1123
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:50,686
Let's kill this.

1124
00:52:50,686 --> 00:52:52,236
Let's go back to

1125
00:52:53,016 --> 00:52:55,216
All right.

1126
00:52:56,216 --> 00:52:59,616
Now Ulysses is

1127
00:52:59,666 --> 00:53:01,486

But one of the things

1133
00:53:10,836 --> 00:53:12,376
that they've done is

1134
00:53:12,376 --> 00:53:14,226
to make your own CSS files

1135
00:53:15,916 --> 00:53:18,166
to style the preview

1136
00:53:18,166 --> 00:53:20,306
So, for example, here

1137
00:53:20,306 --> 00:53:22,216
and I happen to have

1138
00:53:22,216 --> 00:53:30,566
And I can apply that

My name is Ryan Dour.

I'm an engineer on the

00:55:54,246 --> 00:55:56,166
at Apple, but I'm also a deejay.

1191
00:55:56,506 --> 00:55:58,376
All of my life, I've

But during high school

But during high school

1194
00:56:00,156 --> 00:56:02,486
I lost most of my

1195
00:56:03,076 --> 00:56:05,166
I've always deejayed with

1196
00:56:05,196 --> 00:56:07,526
because they offer a

1197
00:56:08,146 --> 00:56:10,136
However, with the rise

1198
00:56:10,136 --> 00:56:11,646
I was feeling pretty left out.

1199
00:56:12,676 --> 00:56:15,596
About a year ago, I got my

1200
00:56:15,596 --> 00:56:17,866
and this external deejay

1201
00:56:17,866 --> 00:56:19,736
into it, and it's been

However, djay Pro for iPad

1203
00:56:25,816 --> 00:56:28,266
to a whole new level, and I'd

1204
00:56:29,026 --> 00:56:33,376
So, over here, I have an

1205
00:56:33,576 --> 00:56:34,796
and this external mixer.

1206
00:56:34,846 --> 00:56:37,036
I'm going to go ahead and

1207
00:56:37,906 --> 00:56:41,206
So, here's the thing

1208
00:56:41,206 --> 00:56:42,746
The external deejay

1209
00:56:42,746 --> 00:56:44,516
as an extension of

And so I can use it

1211
00:56:48,526 --> 00:56:49,856
of a pretty cool performance.

1212
00:56:49,916 --> 00:56:53,226
Also, you're probably wondering

1213
00:56:53,226 --> 00:56:56,426
Not much. I pretty much can see

1214
00:56:56,426 --> 00:56:58,406
and some of the, you know,

1215
00:56:58,406 --> 00:57:00,926
from the deejay controller,

00:56:58,406 --> 00:57:00,926
from the deejay controller,

1217

1218
00:57:03,066 --> 00:57:04,106

Let's go ahead and

1220
00:57:10,296 --> 00:57:12,756
OK, so the first thing

1221
00:57:12,756 --> 00:57:13,596
that I have access

1222
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:15,036

1223
00:57:15,036 --> 00:57:16,556
For example, the time.

1224
00:57:16,556 --> 00:57:18,266
How much time is

1228
00:57:24,226 --> 00:57:25,746
and now I have that

1229
00:57:26,056 --> 00:57:27,946
I also can use these

1230
00:57:28,236 --> 00:57:33,316
For example, if I touch it

1231
00:57:34,256 --> 00:57:36,176
So we hear it's at a

1232
00:57:36,176 --> 00:57:38,296
But if I slow it down

1233
00:57:38,296 --> 00:57:43,626
and I touch it again,

1234
00:57:44,666 --> 00:57:47,456
we can hear exactly how far

1235
00:57:47,456 --> 00:57:48,206
That's really cool.

1236
00:57:48,686 --> 00:57:51,136
I also can use these

1237
00:57:51,196 --> 00:57:52,846

1238
00:57:53,736 --> 00:57:55,806
