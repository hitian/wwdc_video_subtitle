00:00:20,086 --> 00:00:22,786
&gt;&gt; Hello. My name is Tanya,

3
00:00:22,786 --> 00:00:25,696
to the second session about

4
00:00:26,336 --> 00:00:28,616
The video to Part 1

5
00:00:29,076 --> 00:00:31,846
So if you haven't watched

6
00:00:32,576 --> 00:00:34,746
In this session, we'll

7
00:00:34,746 --> 00:00:36,566
on how CarPlay is integrated

8
00:00:36,566 --> 00:00:39,386
into a typical automotive

9
00:00:40,466 --> 00:00:44,296
We'll start with a system

10
00:00:44,346 --> 00:00:45,616
and resource management,

11
00:00:46,006 --> 00:00:48,856
and finish by discussing

12
00:00:50,356 --> 00:00:53,126
Now, let's dive into an

13
00:00:54,916 --> 00:00:56,676
If you watched the first video,

14
00:00:57,006 --> 00:00:59,566
you will recall the

15
00:00:59,566 --> 00:01:01,206
to implement a CarPlay receiver.

16
00:00:59,566 --> 00:01:01,206
to implement a CarPlay receiver.

17
00:01:01,916 --> 00:01:07,226
In summary, you need an IP-based

18
00:01:07,376 --> 00:01:11,346
over USB or over Wi-Fi, IP

19
00:01:11,976 --> 00:01:14,566
an instance of the CarPlay

20
00:01:14,566 --> 00:01:18,786
implementing the control

21
00:01:18,866 --> 00:01:21,796
to play or record sound,

22
00:01:21,796 --> 00:01:23,116
to render the video stream.

23
00:01:24,486 --> 00:01:28,646
However, those components are

24
00:01:28,646 --> 00:01:30,486
in a typical automotive

25
00:01:31,556 --> 00:01:33,906
In addition to the

26
00:01:34,426 --> 00:01:37,026
your unit has its

27
00:01:37,356 --> 00:01:39,006
audio sources, and logic.

28
00:01:39,876 --> 00:01:43,086
Both together build

29
00:01:44,546 --> 00:01:47,896
Then you add all hardware

30
00:01:48,326 --> 00:01:54,006
Microphone, speakers, displays,

31
00:01:54,476 --> 00:01:56,466
and you have the

32
00:01:58,176 --> 00:02:00,596
OK, so we have the full system.

33
00:01:58,176 --> 00:02:00,596
OK, so we have the full system.

34
00:02:01,166 --> 00:02:05,426
Now the question is how do those

35
00:02:05,826 --> 00:02:06,766
work with each other?

36
00:02:08,196 --> 00:02:09,246
Let's understand it.

37
00:02:10,216 --> 00:02:13,746
First, let's look at how

38
00:02:13,906 --> 00:02:16,486
And we will take location

39
00:02:17,226 --> 00:02:20,636
Location information includes

40
00:02:21,026 --> 00:02:23,816
or sensor data like

41
00:02:24,846 --> 00:02:27,356
The data reaches the

42
00:02:27,896 --> 00:02:30,506
must be always available,

43
00:02:30,506 --> 00:02:31,986
by the phone when needed.

44
00:02:33,626 --> 00:02:35,216
Next, let's look

45
00:02:35,216 --> 00:02:38,156
at the instrument cluster

46
00:02:39,196 --> 00:02:41,456
These secondary displays

47
00:02:41,456 --> 00:02:43,856
to show metadata

48
00:02:44,566 --> 00:02:48,656
Such metadata could include the

49
00:02:49,176 --> 00:02:52,816
the active phone call,

50
00:02:53,016 --> 00:02:54,736
the next turn-by-turn direction.

51
00:02:55,306 --> 00:02:59,146
Again, the data is fired

52
00:02:59,186 --> 00:03:00,796
and exchanged on demand.

53
00:02:59,186 --> 00:03:00,796
and exchanged on demand.

54
00:03:02,606 --> 00:03:05,776
Now let's see what happens

55
00:03:06,476 --> 00:03:10,006
Of course, to operate the

56
00:03:10,386 --> 00:03:12,866
the user must either

57
00:03:13,246 --> 00:03:15,096
an app controller, or both.

58
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:18,736
So we can consider

59
00:03:18,736 --> 00:03:21,586
of the user input devices

60
00:03:23,026 --> 00:03:24,986
When the CarPlay UI is active,

61
00:03:25,356 --> 00:03:28,816
the unit is rendering the video

62
00:03:29,236 --> 00:03:32,886
And both the screen and the user

63
00:03:34,456 --> 00:03:39,136
But if the native user interface

64
00:03:39,506 --> 00:03:42,786
then both the display and

65
00:03:42,786 --> 00:03:44,216
to the native sub-system.

66
00:03:45,626 --> 00:03:49,586
However, additional user

67
00:03:49,906 --> 00:03:53,136
like the Voice Recognition

68
00:03:53,516 --> 00:03:55,346
may be linked to CarPlay even

69
00:03:55,346 --> 00:03:57,816
when the native UI is

70
00:03:59,586 --> 00:04:02,906
That way, Siri can

71
00:03:59,586 --> 00:04:02,906
That way, Siri can

72
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,026
or the next audio track played.

73
00:04:07,406 --> 00:04:11,266
OK, now that we looked at the

74
00:04:11,486 --> 00:04:12,816
let's talk about audio.

75
00:04:16,946 --> 00:04:21,516
Audio in the car can be roughly

76
00:04:22,036 --> 00:04:25,936
The first one provides access to

77
00:04:26,326 --> 00:04:29,266
and it's used for phone

78
00:04:30,556 --> 00:04:32,976
Then we have audio playback

79
00:04:33,056 --> 00:04:36,786
for any media content

80
00:04:38,106 --> 00:04:41,546
And last, we have the alerts

81
00:04:41,546 --> 00:04:45,536
for navigation prompts or any

82
00:04:46,926 --> 00:04:48,536
Within the native sub-system,

83
00:04:48,986 --> 00:04:52,606
these three categories

84
00:04:53,776 --> 00:04:56,996
Within CarPlay, we have

85
00:04:57,156 --> 00:04:59,736
which includes phone

86
00:04:59,736 --> 00:05:01,296
and audio playback audio.

87
00:04:59,736 --> 00:05:01,296
and audio playback audio.

88
00:05:02,856 --> 00:05:06,226
And an Alternate audio

89
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:09,206
for higher-priority

90
00:05:09,316 --> 00:05:12,926
such as navigation prompts

91
00:05:15,776 --> 00:05:20,456
So the media channel can either

92
00:05:21,516 --> 00:05:25,656
or media playback from one

93
00:05:27,126 --> 00:05:30,266
OK, now that we have

94
00:05:30,806 --> 00:05:32,226
let's see what happens

95
00:05:32,516 --> 00:05:34,396
when there is a phone

96
00:05:35,966 --> 00:05:40,126
The phone call needs the audio

97
00:05:40,196 --> 00:05:42,496
to both the microphone

98
00:05:43,286 --> 00:05:47,496
So media playback is interrupted

99
00:05:53,046 --> 00:05:56,416
And audio switched over to the

100
00:05:56,456 --> 00:05:58,856
to both the microphone

101
00:05:59,516 --> 00:06:03,436
In addition to switching

102
00:05:59,516 --> 00:06:03,436
In addition to switching

103
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:07,326
the screen switches to CarPlay

104
00:06:08,236 --> 00:06:10,716
And metadata information

105
00:06:10,766 --> 00:06:13,316
on the instrument cluster

106
00:06:14,246 --> 00:06:19,806
Of course, if the native system

107
00:06:19,806 --> 00:06:23,916
outside of CarPlay, then that

108
00:06:24,026 --> 00:06:25,246
on the in-car displays.

109
00:06:26,576 --> 00:06:28,606
But while on a native

110
00:06:28,816 --> 00:06:32,206
the user can be using

111
00:06:33,966 --> 00:06:36,536
So each time there is

112
00:06:36,746 --> 00:06:38,566
Apple Maps will play a sound

113
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:41,336
through the announcement

114
00:06:42,406 --> 00:06:45,256
The phone call continues to

115
00:06:45,256 --> 00:06:50,526
of the car, but the turn-by-turn

116
00:06:50,926 --> 00:06:52,996
as they are mixed

117
00:06:54,056 --> 00:06:58,026
Of course, in such situation,

118
00:06:58,616 --> 00:07:02,646
to hear the phone navigation

119
00:06:58,616 --> 00:07:02,646
to hear the phone navigation

120
00:07:02,646 --> 00:07:04,746
that an upcoming turn is coming.

121
00:07:05,146 --> 00:07:09,506
And if the user wants to

122
00:07:09,716 --> 00:07:12,096
the main display

123
00:07:13,776 --> 00:07:20,076
And last, after the phone call

124
00:07:20,076 --> 00:07:21,616
through the native sub-system

125
00:07:22,336 --> 00:07:24,666
as that was what the

126
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:26,086
to prior to the phone call.

127
00:07:27,086 --> 00:07:31,636
Now, the navigation announcement

128
00:07:31,746 --> 00:07:35,186
direction as the user is

129
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:36,916
All right.

130
00:07:37,906 --> 00:07:43,056
As you see, integrating CarPlay

131
00:07:43,056 --> 00:07:46,056
especially in regards to

132
00:07:46,956 --> 00:07:49,436
But before we get

133
00:07:49,896 --> 00:07:51,416
let's look at volume controls.

134
00:07:54,026 --> 00:07:55,016
Volume management.

135
00:07:56,306 --> 00:08:00,636
As you might know, a usual

136
00:07:56,306 --> 00:08:00,636
As you might know, a usual

137
00:08:00,636 --> 00:08:04,616
volume indicator while the user

138
00:08:04,956 --> 00:08:07,486
and that volume knob

139
00:08:07,486 --> 00:08:09,126
of the currently-playing audio.

140
00:08:11,486 --> 00:08:14,436
The same principle

141
00:08:15,016 --> 00:08:18,446
but there is a different

142
00:08:18,446 --> 00:08:20,396
of the major CarPlay

143
00:08:21,366 --> 00:08:23,546
Let's look through them.

144
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:28,106
During Siri playback, the volume

145
00:08:28,106 --> 00:08:29,246
to voice interactions.

146
00:08:30,506 --> 00:08:31,846
For an incoming phone call,

147
00:08:32,056 --> 00:08:33,986
the volume of the

148
00:08:35,826 --> 00:08:37,785
When the user is

149
00:08:38,096 --> 00:08:40,426
the phone call audio

150
00:08:42,096 --> 00:08:44,976
And if a next turn

151
00:08:45,076 --> 00:08:46,506
navigation prompts are played.

152
00:08:47,106 --> 00:08:49,896
Then, the user can change

153
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:53,526
And remember, media could

154
00:08:54,036 --> 00:08:56,876
but its volume will be

155
00:08:57,236 --> 00:08:58,526
and cannot be adjusted.

156
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:03,736
Once the announcement is over

157
00:09:04,136 --> 00:09:06,856
the button controls

158
00:09:08,346 --> 00:09:11,646
All right, now let's look

159
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:17,526
We are going to take a look at

160
00:09:17,856 --> 00:09:19,526
talk about how they are managed,

161
00:09:19,836 --> 00:09:22,176
and go over a couple

162
00:09:24,386 --> 00:09:27,066
So we saw that there are

163
00:09:27,706 --> 00:09:30,936
but let's understand which

164
00:09:31,146 --> 00:09:33,556
And there's only two:

165
00:09:34,366 --> 00:09:37,606
The mainScreen representing

166
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:41,356
and mainAudio as the

167
00:09:41,446 --> 00:09:43,016
to the car's audio system.

168
00:09:45,106 --> 00:09:48,456
Those resources can either

169
00:09:49,466 --> 00:09:52,066
When you take a resource,

170
00:09:52,066 --> 00:09:53,706
for unlimited amount of time.

171
00:09:54,006 --> 00:09:55,256
It's basically yours.

172
00:09:56,266 --> 00:09:59,466
When you borrow a resource,

173
00:09:59,856 --> 00:10:02,406
but you have to give it

174
00:09:59,856 --> 00:10:02,406
but you have to give it

175
00:10:04,346 --> 00:10:08,576
OK, so let's have the

176
00:10:08,576 --> 00:10:10,166
over the display permanently.

177
00:10:10,836 --> 00:10:14,366
The user can be using native

178
00:10:14,366 --> 00:10:17,486
to FM radio, or adjusting

179
00:10:19,126 --> 00:10:21,696
What triggers such permanent

180
00:10:22,866 --> 00:10:24,676
The native UI can

181
00:10:24,676 --> 00:10:29,276
when the user presses a hard

182
00:10:29,576 --> 00:10:32,276
from the entry point

183
00:10:33,346 --> 00:10:36,376
or by using the native

184
00:10:36,376 --> 00:10:38,536
out a specific native

185
00:10:40,866 --> 00:10:44,306
Now let's say the user

186
00:10:44,306 --> 00:10:45,366
from the main menu.

187
00:10:48,476 --> 00:10:51,496
In this case, CarPlay

188
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:53,876
as the user explicitly

189
00:10:55,386 --> 00:10:58,676
Again, what can trigger

190
00:10:59,376 --> 00:11:01,236
Any hard key linked to CarPlay.

191
00:10:59,376 --> 00:11:01,236
Any hard key linked to CarPlay.

192
00:11:02,066 --> 00:11:05,206
Or, as we saw, through

193
00:11:05,296 --> 00:11:06,266
within the native UI.

194
00:11:07,356 --> 00:11:13,246
Or through Siri, for example,

195
00:11:14,086 --> 00:11:16,056
Now, there are other

196
00:11:16,156 --> 00:11:17,936
that need to borrow a resource.

197
00:11:18,506 --> 00:11:22,136
Remember, they just need it for

198
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:25,366
Which applications

199
00:11:26,446 --> 00:11:28,906
That's phone calls,

200
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:32,016
notifications, or alerts.

201
00:11:34,116 --> 00:11:35,416
Let's look at an example.

202
00:11:36,256 --> 00:11:39,396
The native UI has taken

203
00:11:39,466 --> 00:11:41,556
and is permanently

204
00:11:44,006 --> 00:11:45,946
Now the user gets a

205
00:11:46,646 --> 00:11:50,496
The CarPlay UI borrows

206
00:11:50,576 --> 00:11:52,066
for the duration of the call.

207
00:11:52,986 --> 00:11:59,456
Once the call ends, we go back

208
00:11:59,456 --> 00:12:01,486
until further user action.

209
00:11:59,456 --> 00:12:01,486
until further user action.

210
00:12:05,046 --> 00:12:07,476
Then, let's look at the

211
00:12:08,366 --> 00:12:11,126
Main Audio can be split

212
00:12:11,516 --> 00:12:14,666
Each type is used for a

213
00:12:15,016 --> 00:12:18,256
as it provides access to a

214
00:12:19,816 --> 00:12:25,956
Media is audio output only and

215
00:12:26,726 --> 00:12:30,346
Alert is also only output

216
00:12:30,346 --> 00:12:32,816
and plays ringtones

217
00:12:34,326 --> 00:12:36,846
speechRecognition

218
00:12:37,216 --> 00:12:39,256
as it adds access

219
00:12:40,786 --> 00:12:43,926
Same for the telephony type,

220
00:12:45,516 --> 00:12:49,786
And same for the default, which

221
00:12:52,466 --> 00:12:55,246
But don't forget the

222
00:12:55,246 --> 00:12:57,106
for navigation announcement.

223
00:12:58,336 --> 00:13:00,156
alternateAudio is not managed.

224
00:12:58,336 --> 00:13:00,156
alternateAudio is not managed.

225
00:13:00,606 --> 00:13:03,836
It is basically always

226
00:13:03,836 --> 00:13:05,116
to take it or borrow it.

227
00:13:05,946 --> 00:13:09,596
alternateAudio is mixed

228
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:13,516
within the mainAudio channel,

229
00:13:15,186 --> 00:13:18,466
And with this, I'm going

230
00:13:18,466 --> 00:13:19,786
about the resource manager.

231
00:13:20,696 --> 00:13:23,516
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Tanya.

232
00:13:23,866 --> 00:13:26,886
Hi. I'm Tom, and I also work on

233
00:13:27,616 --> 00:13:30,106
So now that you've learned which

234
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:32,956
and you know you can either

235
00:13:33,356 --> 00:13:35,126
let's talk about how you

236
00:13:35,616 --> 00:13:39,216
To be able to distribute

237
00:13:39,216 --> 00:13:42,296
between the two sub-systems, we

238
00:13:42,636 --> 00:13:45,456
And we call such an

239
00:13:48,486 --> 00:13:50,976
So what does the

240
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:53,466
It has three main tasks.

241
00:13:53,816 --> 00:13:56,436
First, it holds the current

242
00:13:57,276 --> 00:14:01,276
Second, it follows a set

243
00:13:57,276 --> 00:14:01,276
Second, it follows a set

244
00:14:01,276 --> 00:14:03,036
which system will

245
00:14:03,686 --> 00:14:06,726
Third, based on the current

246
00:14:07,316 --> 00:14:10,166
it assigns the resource

247
00:14:10,336 --> 00:14:12,356
So let's see how this

248
00:14:13,536 --> 00:14:17,806
Let's say both the

249
00:14:17,806 --> 00:14:18,986
to show something on the screen.

250
00:14:20,196 --> 00:14:23,196
So both send a request to

251
00:14:23,936 --> 00:14:28,176
Then, the resource manager

252
00:14:28,176 --> 00:14:30,476
and decides which of the

253
00:14:30,506 --> 00:14:31,936
to the display.

254
00:14:33,626 --> 00:14:34,896
Let's say, in this case,

255
00:14:34,896 --> 00:14:37,306
the native UI request

256
00:14:37,406 --> 00:14:38,666
and the screen is

257
00:14:39,156 --> 00:14:41,266
The resource manager

258
00:14:41,266 --> 00:14:43,126
that the screen can now

259
00:14:45,056 --> 00:14:48,516
Only then the native UI can

260
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:51,476
It's important to note that

261
00:14:51,476 --> 00:14:55,706
until the resource

262
00:14:56,436 --> 00:14:58,006
So where does the

263
00:14:58,536 --> 00:15:01,486
Is it part of the native

264
00:14:58,536 --> 00:15:01,486
Is it part of the native

265
00:15:02,376 --> 00:15:03,686
Well, when we designed CarPlay,

266
00:15:04,006 --> 00:15:05,436
we asked ourselves

267
00:15:06,336 --> 00:15:07,516
We considered the complexity

268
00:15:07,516 --> 00:15:10,116
of exchanging detailed

269
00:15:10,546 --> 00:15:11,436
We considered the future.

270
00:15:12,046 --> 00:15:13,966
What, if any, of those

271
00:15:15,056 --> 00:15:17,556
What if new applications became

272
00:15:17,556 --> 00:15:19,836
that the vehicle had no

273
00:15:20,706 --> 00:15:23,896
What solution would give us the

274
00:15:23,896 --> 00:15:24,456
down the road?

275
00:15:25,086 --> 00:15:27,536
So we decided to implement a

276
00:15:27,536 --> 00:15:30,646
on the native system is lower

277
00:15:30,646 --> 00:15:31,576
after the vehicle has been

278
00:15:31,576 --> 00:15:32,916
in the customer's

279
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:37,226
Hence, the resource manager

280
00:15:38,286 --> 00:15:43,076
And because the resource

281
00:15:43,546 --> 00:15:45,206
with which the native

282
00:15:45,206 --> 00:15:46,996
we refer to the iPhone

283
00:15:47,036 --> 00:15:48,906
and the head unit

284
00:15:49,766 --> 00:15:51,676
But don't forget, all

285
00:15:51,676 --> 00:15:54,156
of the iPhone applications

286
00:15:54,246 --> 00:15:56,226
in the same way as

287
00:15:59,596 --> 00:16:02,656
Next. What commands

288
00:15:59,596 --> 00:16:02,656
Next. What commands

289
00:16:02,656 --> 00:16:03,636
with the resource manager?

290
00:16:04,526 --> 00:16:05,746
It's simple.

291
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:07,526
You only need two commands.

292
00:16:08,256 --> 00:16:10,186
The changeModes command

293
00:16:10,186 --> 00:16:12,876
or release a resource, and the

294
00:16:12,876 --> 00:16:14,266
to describe the current states.

295
00:16:16,296 --> 00:16:18,866
changeModes is the notification

296
00:16:19,396 --> 00:16:21,666
the accessory in this case,

297
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:23,426
to the resource manager,

298
00:16:29,286 --> 00:16:32,296
This changeModes command

299
00:16:32,296 --> 00:16:33,426
to do with the resource.

300
00:16:33,886 --> 00:16:36,926
It declares why it needs

301
00:16:36,926 --> 00:16:39,466
or borrow the resource

302
00:16:41,586 --> 00:16:43,686
The modesChanged is

303
00:16:43,686 --> 00:16:45,516
by the controller

304
00:16:48,306 --> 00:16:50,216
modesChanged provides

305
00:16:50,466 --> 00:16:53,206
which describes who's the owner

306
00:16:53,986 --> 00:16:55,296
It sends so the accessory knows

307
00:16:55,296 --> 00:16:56,616
if a resource has

308
00:16:56,846 --> 00:16:57,996
and the owner has changed.

309
00:17:00,796 --> 00:17:02,616
Now we'll talk about how

310
00:17:02,616 --> 00:17:03,286
in more detail.

311
00:17:04,276 --> 00:17:06,276
We will start with

312
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:08,736
of switching audio

313
00:17:08,876 --> 00:17:11,816
Then, we'll talk about

314
00:17:13,016 --> 00:17:14,746
then how to handle

315
00:17:14,746 --> 00:17:16,685
where you would not

316
00:17:16,685 --> 00:17:19,376
to interrupt you unless

317
00:17:19,376 --> 00:17:21,296
where Siri triggers

318
00:17:22,945 --> 00:17:24,636
So let's look at

319
00:17:25,646 --> 00:17:27,306
Let's say iPhone

320
00:17:27,306 --> 00:17:31,306
through the car speakers, then

321
00:17:31,306 --> 00:17:33,456
through the native system

322
00:17:37,486 --> 00:17:40,316
The unit sends a changeModes

323
00:17:40,316 --> 00:17:43,096
of the speakers,

324
00:17:43,376 --> 00:17:45,766
as the user might continue

325
00:17:45,766 --> 00:17:47,366
for a prolonged period of time.

326
00:17:48,796 --> 00:17:50,816
The controller assigns

327
00:17:50,816 --> 00:17:52,856
and it sends a modesChanged

328
00:17:53,476 --> 00:17:57,386
And the head unit is the new

329
00:18:01,096 --> 00:18:03,026
so it can now start

330
00:18:03,766 --> 00:18:05,556
The mainAudio resource

331
00:18:05,556 --> 00:18:06,786
to the head unit at this point.

332
00:18:09,556 --> 00:18:11,366
So, in summary, this

333
00:18:11,906 --> 00:18:14,906
when to take a resource and that

334
00:18:14,906 --> 00:18:17,166
that resource before it is

335
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:24,086
Let's look at the next example

336
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:27,366
FM radio is still playing

337
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:29,376
Let's see what happens

338
00:18:29,376 --> 00:18:31,626
if the user triggers the

339
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:37,686
The unit requests to temporarily

340
00:18:37,686 --> 00:18:39,826
so the transferType

341
00:18:39,826 --> 00:18:42,396
to borrow the audio and screen.

342
00:18:43,006 --> 00:18:46,856
Both the mainScreen and the

343
00:18:46,906 --> 00:18:47,466
to the accessory.

344
00:18:50,006 --> 00:18:53,476
And the native voice

345
00:18:55,566 --> 00:18:56,906
Once the voice dialogue

346
00:18:57,146 --> 00:18:59,066
the head unit returns

347
00:18:59,066 --> 00:19:00,606
by sending an unborrow command.

348
00:18:59,066 --> 00:19:00,606
by sending an unborrow command.

349
00:19:01,886 --> 00:19:05,546
And since the unit was

350
00:19:05,976 --> 00:19:08,276
the resource is again

351
00:19:10,246 --> 00:19:11,526
and FM radio can resume.

352
00:19:11,686 --> 00:19:15,336
Now you may be wondering,

353
00:19:15,336 --> 00:19:17,486
to borrow the resource if

354
00:19:17,966 --> 00:19:19,086
Well, that's a great question.

355
00:19:20,136 --> 00:19:22,456
Whenever the resource manager

356
00:19:22,456 --> 00:19:24,036
to change the ownership

357
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:26,156
it must know what the current

358
00:19:26,626 --> 00:19:27,576
The resource manager needs

359
00:19:27,576 --> 00:19:29,366
to know why you're

360
00:19:29,366 --> 00:19:31,056
so that they can take

361
00:19:31,056 --> 00:19:32,996
if somebody else needs

362
00:19:35,156 --> 00:19:36,476
Let's move on to

363
00:19:37,486 --> 00:19:38,446
showing the backup camera.

364
00:19:40,776 --> 00:19:42,186
Let's say CarPlay

365
00:19:42,186 --> 00:19:44,186
and the native UI is

366
00:19:44,886 --> 00:19:47,016
When the user switches

367
00:19:47,176 --> 00:19:48,436
the unit borrows the screen.

368
00:19:49,546 --> 00:19:52,366
However, notice it also

369
00:19:52,366 --> 00:19:54,156
that the screen cannot

370
00:19:59,246 --> 00:20:02,456
The resource manager assigns

371
00:19:59,246 --> 00:20:02,456
The resource manager assigns

372
00:20:02,456 --> 00:20:04,526
and also notes the limitation.

373
00:20:06,206 --> 00:20:07,936
So the backup camera

374
00:20:08,736 --> 00:20:10,356
CarPlay audio continues to play,

375
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:12,766
but now the user

376
00:20:15,706 --> 00:20:17,856
The iPhone cannot show

377
00:20:17,886 --> 00:20:19,966
as the head unit has

378
00:20:20,196 --> 00:20:22,056
but the ringtone plays

379
00:20:22,586 --> 00:20:24,676
So how did that happen?

380
00:20:26,046 --> 00:20:27,146
With the changeModes command,

381
00:20:27,146 --> 00:20:29,376
the unit told the resource

382
00:20:29,376 --> 00:20:30,836
by the resources

383
00:20:31,206 --> 00:20:33,136
By setting the borrowConstraint

384
00:20:33,136 --> 00:20:35,026
the unit allows the

385
00:20:35,026 --> 00:20:36,126
to borrow the resource.

386
00:20:36,596 --> 00:20:39,536
By setting it to user-initiated

387
00:20:39,536 --> 00:20:40,636
by the user can borrow.

388
00:20:41,566 --> 00:20:44,186
With never, no application

389
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:45,756
as with this example.

390
00:20:47,426 --> 00:20:50,276
As you see, the constraints

391
00:20:50,276 --> 00:20:52,166
on the system behavior,

392
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:53,136
that they are used properly.

393
00:20:53,986 --> 00:20:55,956
Only restrict access

394
00:20:55,956 --> 00:20:57,696
for immediate user attention.

395
00:20:58,146 --> 00:20:59,946
Do not restrict permanent

396
00:20:59,946 --> 00:21:01,536
when CarPlay is connected.

397
00:20:59,946 --> 00:21:01,536
when CarPlay is connected.

398
00:21:02,026 --> 00:21:04,666
So that was using backup camera.

399
00:21:06,286 --> 00:21:08,136
And the last example we want

400
00:21:08,136 --> 00:21:09,276
when Siri plays music.

401
00:21:10,836 --> 00:21:12,696
Again, we start with

402
00:21:13,386 --> 00:21:15,196
The user triggers Siri.

403
00:21:17,896 --> 00:21:19,166
Siri is launched on the phone

404
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:21,726
and the resource manager

405
00:21:21,726 --> 00:21:23,846
that the resources have

406
00:21:25,656 --> 00:21:29,386
Siri shows up and the user can

407
00:21:32,226 --> 00:21:34,386
Siri returns the display

408
00:21:34,386 --> 00:21:37,066
but the music app now needs the

409
00:21:37,576 --> 00:21:40,926
So the resource manager notifies

410
00:21:40,926 --> 00:21:43,366
with the phone, but the screen

411
00:21:44,446 --> 00:21:46,986
The head unit does not

412
00:21:47,586 --> 00:21:51,726
and so iPhone audio

413
00:21:51,726 --> 00:21:54,956
So what did we see here?

414
00:21:55,456 --> 00:21:57,876
On two occasions, the resource

415
00:21:57,876 --> 00:21:59,456
without a request

416
00:21:59,826 --> 00:22:02,676
And this is completely

417
00:21:59,826 --> 00:22:02,676
And this is completely

418
00:22:02,676 --> 00:22:05,716
on the device request

419
00:22:05,876 --> 00:22:08,146
And if they get them, the

420
00:22:09,066 --> 00:22:10,116
So, how to handle this?

421
00:22:10,956 --> 00:22:14,126
First, after each modesChanged,

422
00:22:14,586 --> 00:22:16,666
If you are, resume

423
00:22:16,866 --> 00:22:19,286
Otherwise, you should wait

424
00:22:20,096 --> 00:22:23,076
Second, do not ignore

425
00:22:23,076 --> 00:22:24,736
when they are triggered

426
00:22:27,106 --> 00:22:28,616
OK, so far, we've looked

427
00:22:28,616 --> 00:22:30,936
at examples showing how

428
00:22:30,936 --> 00:22:32,976
But there is another

429
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:34,366
to accomplish the same task.

430
00:22:34,826 --> 00:22:38,336
So let's look at how

431
00:22:38,856 --> 00:22:41,106
We need to manage native

432
00:22:41,106 --> 00:22:42,436
which have similar features.

433
00:22:42,436 --> 00:22:43,986
But what are those applications?

434
00:22:44,876 --> 00:22:47,916
They are active route

435
00:22:48,186 --> 00:22:49,236
and voice recognition.

436
00:22:51,366 --> 00:22:53,016
We achieve those

437
00:22:53,416 --> 00:22:54,426
But what is an appState?

438
00:22:55,056 --> 00:22:57,636
We use different appStates to

439
00:22:57,636 --> 00:22:59,846
in the shared application

440
00:23:00,186 --> 00:23:03,006
on the accessory or the

441
00:23:04,036 --> 00:23:06,186
So the three different

442
00:23:06,636 --> 00:23:08,516
PhoneCall, and Speech.

443
00:23:09,296 --> 00:23:12,416
So let's have a look at how

444
00:23:12,416 --> 00:23:15,106
that route guidance

445
00:23:16,966 --> 00:23:19,236
When turn-by-turn navigation

446
00:23:19,456 --> 00:23:21,186
it uses a changeModes command

447
00:23:21,306 --> 00:23:23,516
to update the TurnByTurn

448
00:23:27,646 --> 00:23:30,636
With this example, it is

449
00:23:31,136 --> 00:23:33,236
So the controller grants

450
00:23:33,236 --> 00:23:35,826
to the accessory, returning a

451
00:23:35,826 --> 00:23:38,916
accessory as currently

452
00:23:40,746 --> 00:23:42,136
Now let's look what happens

453
00:23:42,136 --> 00:23:44,926
when the user sets a new

454
00:23:45,016 --> 00:23:47,006
while the native system

455
00:23:47,656 --> 00:23:51,466
The user says, "Siri, take me

456
00:23:51,936 --> 00:23:54,866
Now, the iPhone has

457
00:23:54,956 --> 00:23:57,406
So the controller updates

458
00:23:59,806 --> 00:24:01,416
This is the instruction

459
00:23:59,806 --> 00:24:01,416
This is the instruction

460
00:24:01,416 --> 00:24:04,036
to stop its own native

461
00:24:05,866 --> 00:24:07,766
Now, the iPhone has

462
00:24:07,766 --> 00:24:09,846
so the controller updates

463
00:24:10,376 --> 00:24:11,876
This is the instruction

464
00:24:11,876 --> 00:24:14,066
to stop its own native

465
00:24:16,126 --> 00:24:18,716
So now, the Apple Maps

466
00:24:18,716 --> 00:24:21,766
shown on the display and

467
00:24:21,766 --> 00:24:24,836
And there will be no conflict

468
00:24:27,736 --> 00:24:29,926
So now when the Apple Maps

469
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:31,906
shown on the display and

470
00:24:31,966 --> 00:24:34,406
there will be no conflict with

471
00:24:36,406 --> 00:24:37,686
So that was route guidance.

472
00:24:38,246 --> 00:24:39,436
Now let's look at a phone call.

473
00:24:41,326 --> 00:24:43,146
If the unit supports

474
00:24:43,306 --> 00:24:44,786
over Bluetooth Hands-Free

475
00:24:44,786 --> 00:24:46,266
and there was an

476
00:24:46,956 --> 00:24:48,836
the call uses mainAudio

477
00:24:49,306 --> 00:24:51,136
The phone call cannot

478
00:24:51,536 --> 00:24:53,576
So what happens if the

479
00:24:53,576 --> 00:24:54,686
on the CarPlay device?

480
00:24:55,996 --> 00:24:58,826
The CarPlay call rings

481
00:24:58,826 --> 00:25:00,996
as it should not interrupt

482
00:24:58,826 --> 00:25:00,996
as it should not interrupt

483
00:25:01,646 --> 00:25:03,656
This is managed using

484
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:07,216
And lastly, let's look

485
00:25:08,146 --> 00:25:11,046
If the unit has a native voice

486
00:25:11,046 --> 00:25:12,806
it has borrowed the resources

487
00:25:12,946 --> 00:25:15,586
and is exclusively using

488
00:25:15,586 --> 00:25:16,686
and screen resources.

489
00:25:17,546 --> 00:25:20,836
But it can be interrupted at any

490
00:25:21,796 --> 00:25:24,396
So if Siri is triggered

491
00:25:25,976 --> 00:25:28,596
native voice recognition

492
00:25:28,636 --> 00:25:29,646
on the in-car display.

493
00:25:30,326 --> 00:25:32,356
The Speech appState is

494
00:25:35,126 --> 00:25:38,656
So, in summary, CarPlay

495
00:25:38,656 --> 00:25:41,026
as your native system and

496
00:25:41,026 --> 00:25:42,706
with your native

497
00:25:43,456 --> 00:25:46,346
For a great CarPlay experience,

498
00:25:46,346 --> 00:25:49,726
for each use case and follow the

499
00:25:50,556 --> 00:25:52,556
The CarPlay specifications

500
00:25:52,556 --> 00:25:53,686
through the MFi Program.

501
00:25:54,456 --> 00:25:56,956
If you haven't watched

502
00:25:56,956 --> 00:25:59,216
