3
00:00:30,956 --> 00:00:32,586
&gt;&gt; Hello. Good morning,

4
00:00:33,336 --> 00:00:35,886
Welcome to Part 1 of

5
00:00:36,346 --> 00:00:38,566
My name is Bhaskar

6
00:00:38,566 --> 00:00:39,946
on the Messages Team at Apple.

7
00:00:40,556 --> 00:00:43,616
Today we are introducing

8
00:00:43,926 --> 00:00:46,326
And what that means is that

9
00:00:46,376 --> 00:00:48,976
that run within the context

10
00:00:49,376 --> 00:00:53,596
iMessage apps can provide

11
00:00:55,576 --> 00:00:58,476
Number one, they can

12
00:00:58,926 --> 00:01:00,746
Interactive messages

13
00:00:58,926 --> 00:01:00,746
Interactive messages

14
00:01:00,746 --> 00:01:03,446
that your application generates

15
00:01:03,446 --> 00:01:05,556
on this message, it will

16
00:01:06,526 --> 00:01:08,906
For example, in the

17
00:01:09,556 --> 00:01:12,376
I'm using the DoorDash app

18
00:01:12,376 --> 00:01:14,046
for the party that we

19
00:01:14,926 --> 00:01:17,616
On their phones they will

20
00:01:18,056 --> 00:01:20,686
and if they have the application

21
00:01:20,686 --> 00:01:23,316
to tap on it and tapping

22
00:01:23,436 --> 00:01:25,986
At that point they will be

23
00:01:25,986 --> 00:01:30,446
add stuff to it, and

24
00:01:30,486 --> 00:01:31,926
iMessage apps can

25
00:01:32,616 --> 00:01:35,906
Stickers are images

26
00:01:36,066 --> 00:01:38,586
and we believe it

27
00:01:38,586 --> 00:01:41,696
and interactive experience

28
00:01:42,236 --> 00:01:47,976
And lastly, iMessage apps

29
00:01:47,976 --> 00:01:51,336
of content that Messages has

30
00:01:51,736 --> 00:01:57,476
videos, text, links, et cetera.

31
00:01:57,626 --> 00:02:01,106
Also in iOS 10 we will

32
00:01:57,626 --> 00:02:01,106
Also in iOS 10 we will

33
00:02:01,736 --> 00:02:03,806
What that means is that

34
00:02:03,806 --> 00:02:06,526
and create will be

35
00:02:06,526 --> 00:02:07,636
in this Messages App Store.

36
00:02:08,366 --> 00:02:11,266
Users will be able to get to

37
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:13,486
and they will be able to

38
00:02:14,806 --> 00:02:17,586
Applications that your users

39
00:02:17,586 --> 00:02:19,386
displayed within

40
00:02:19,386 --> 00:02:23,706
which we call the

41
00:02:23,906 --> 00:02:26,996
We also have this great

42
00:02:26,996 --> 00:02:29,066
to discover your

43
00:02:29,496 --> 00:02:31,636
and we call it inline

44
00:02:32,536 --> 00:02:34,616
Let's try to understand what

45
00:02:35,636 --> 00:02:38,856
In the screenshot shown here

46
00:02:38,856 --> 00:02:43,016
from my friend but I do not

47
00:02:43,336 --> 00:02:44,566
from which he sent the Sticker.

48
00:02:45,446 --> 00:02:48,176
In that case, as you can

49
00:02:48,736 --> 00:02:51,486
beneath the Sticker we will

50
00:02:51,486 --> 00:02:52,746
from which the Sticker was sent.

51
00:02:53,436 --> 00:02:56,086
And tapping on the piece of text

52
00:02:56,086 --> 00:02:58,816
Store and present me

53
00:02:58,816 --> 00:02:59,946
from which the Sticker was sent.

54
00:03:00,576 --> 00:03:02,776
And then I can download

55
00:03:02,776 --> 00:03:04,396
like any other iMessage app.

56
00:03:05,176 --> 00:03:10,446
In this example shown here, I

57
00:03:10,446 --> 00:03:12,286
to illustrate inline

58
00:03:12,756 --> 00:03:15,556
However, it applies to

59
00:03:15,556 --> 00:03:20,786
that your iMessage

60
00:03:20,786 --> 00:03:23,866
Also creating an iMessage

61
00:03:23,866 --> 00:03:25,656
to creating any other

62
00:03:25,656 --> 00:03:26,836
that you have already created.

63
00:03:27,466 --> 00:03:29,766
You will be able to use the

64
00:03:29,766 --> 00:03:31,836
and framework that you

65
00:03:32,656 --> 00:03:35,846
For example, some of the

66
00:03:36,696 --> 00:03:41,166
You can do in-app purchase

67
00:03:42,376 --> 00:03:43,916
you will have access

68
00:03:45,486 --> 00:03:48,266
and your iMessage app will

69
00:03:48,386 --> 00:03:50,196
And we believe these

70
00:03:50,196 --> 00:03:51,186
and features will allow you

71
00:03:51,186 --> 00:03:53,386
to create great apps

72
00:03:53,496 --> 00:03:57,406
Now let's talk about

73
00:03:58,116 --> 00:04:00,726
iMessage apps will

74
00:03:58,116 --> 00:04:00,726
iMessage apps will

75
00:04:02,466 --> 00:04:05,756
However, the content that your

76
00:04:05,756 --> 00:04:09,846
sent to, and can be viewed

77
00:04:10,396 --> 00:04:15,776
In watchOS 3.0, within

78
00:04:15,986 --> 00:04:18,096
we also have a new page

79
00:04:18,636 --> 00:04:22,246
The Recents Page, amongst other

80
00:04:22,486 --> 00:04:24,786
that your users had recently

81
00:04:25,646 --> 00:04:27,086
And you users will

82
00:04:27,086 --> 00:04:29,216
to see these recent Stickers,

83
00:04:29,216 --> 00:04:31,666
to send these Stickers

84
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:33,186
like they are able to

85
00:04:33,186 --> 00:04:37,946
So that was about the

86
00:04:38,176 --> 00:04:39,556
and the Messages platform.

87
00:04:39,936 --> 00:04:42,556
Now let's get into details

88
00:04:43,426 --> 00:04:44,666
This is what we're

89
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:46,116
in the rest of the

90
00:04:46,466 --> 00:04:49,756
First we are going to talk

91
00:04:50,226 --> 00:04:52,526
Messages framework is the

92
00:04:52,526 --> 00:04:55,936
to familiarize yourself with

93
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:57,666
Then we're going to talk

94
00:04:57,666 --> 00:04:59,726
about creating a

95
00:05:00,206 --> 00:05:04,266
Next we are going to go into

96
00:05:04,616 --> 00:05:06,516
and other constraints

97
00:05:07,036 --> 00:05:09,206
And lastly we're going to talk

98
00:05:09,206 --> 00:05:11,216
about creating a custom

99
00:05:11,216 --> 00:05:12,026
Messages framework.

100
00:05:12,546 --> 00:05:16,106
What we will not cover

101
00:05:16,106 --> 00:05:18,856
to create an application that

102
00:05:19,366 --> 00:05:22,676
We will cover such an

103
00:05:22,676 --> 00:05:24,986
of our talk and I

104
00:05:24,986 --> 00:05:26,226
to please come back for that.

105
00:05:26,586 --> 00:05:32,356
That will be here on Thursday

106
00:05:32,926 --> 00:05:34,306
Messages framework

107
00:05:34,306 --> 00:05:36,286
that we are introducing

108
00:05:37,056 --> 00:05:38,986
Messages framework

109
00:05:38,986 --> 00:05:41,706
between your iMessages app

110
00:05:42,756 --> 00:05:45,586
When your user taps on your app

111
00:05:45,836 --> 00:05:48,976
it is through this framework

112
00:05:48,976 --> 00:05:51,616
launch it, and provide

113
00:05:51,996 --> 00:05:53,956
and other context

114
00:05:54,036 --> 00:05:54,846
to lay out its UI.

115
00:05:55,896 --> 00:05:59,496
Once your application has

116
00:05:59,496 --> 00:06:01,206
ready to interact with it.

117
00:05:59,496 --> 00:06:01,206
ready to interact with it.

118
00:06:01,436 --> 00:06:04,216
And at the end of that

119
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:08,636
will hopefully generate some

120
00:06:08,636 --> 00:06:14,076
to share by Messages and your

121
00:06:14,076 --> 00:06:15,706
to Messages by this framework.

122
00:06:15,856 --> 00:06:18,146
And at that point your

123
00:06:18,146 --> 00:06:19,256
that thing via Messages

124
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:23,096
with whomever they're

125
00:06:23,096 --> 00:06:25,926
I would like to mention

126
00:06:26,256 --> 00:06:28,296
and iMessage apps

127
00:06:28,296 --> 00:06:30,386
of existing app extension

128
00:06:31,396 --> 00:06:34,916
And in that sense your

129
00:06:35,216 --> 00:06:37,826
and in this scenario the

130
00:06:37,826 --> 00:06:41,266
as the host application

131
00:06:42,496 --> 00:06:44,656
For those of you

132
00:06:44,656 --> 00:06:47,956
or who have not made extensions

133
00:06:47,956 --> 00:06:50,936
that you please go back and

134
00:06:50,936 --> 00:06:56,406
from 2014 that introduces

135
00:06:58,196 --> 00:07:01,826
So as I just mentioned, iMessage

136
00:06:58,196 --> 00:07:01,826
So as I just mentioned, iMessage

137
00:07:01,826 --> 00:07:03,746
there's one key difference

138
00:07:03,746 --> 00:07:05,716
to other extension

139
00:07:06,866 --> 00:07:09,516
Unlike other extension

140
00:07:09,576 --> 00:07:11,186
to provide a containing

141
00:07:11,436 --> 00:07:12,856
for your iMessage app.

142
00:07:12,856 --> 00:07:15,326
You can only ship your

143
00:07:16,426 --> 00:07:18,926
But if you already have

144
00:07:18,926 --> 00:07:21,026
that you created or that

145
00:07:21,026 --> 00:07:24,376
to the App Store, you can

146
00:07:24,376 --> 00:07:26,376
within your containing

147
00:07:26,376 --> 00:07:27,746
as I mentioned, these

148
00:07:30,816 --> 00:07:33,316
So if you provide a

149
00:07:33,626 --> 00:07:36,596
then your application will

150
00:07:36,596 --> 00:07:39,356
of your users' phones and

151
00:07:39,396 --> 00:07:40,116
within Messages.

152
00:07:40,696 --> 00:07:42,566
It will also show up

153
00:07:42,956 --> 00:07:44,326
and in the Messages App Store.

154
00:07:45,276 --> 00:07:48,496
But if you do not provide a

155
00:07:48,496 --> 00:07:50,936
as you can see, your

156
00:07:50,936 --> 00:07:53,776
up in the main Home screen

157
00:07:54,076 --> 00:07:56,566
It will only show up in

158
00:07:56,856 --> 00:07:59,576
and the Messages App Store.

159
00:07:59,766 --> 00:08:03,106
I would like to mention that if

160
00:07:59,766 --> 00:08:03,106
I would like to mention that if

161
00:08:03,106 --> 00:08:05,916
application, you still

162
00:08:06,186 --> 00:08:07,486
for your containing application.

163
00:08:08,296 --> 00:08:10,456
This is the icon that will

164
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:13,506
of the system like the Settings

165
00:08:13,506 --> 00:08:15,326
about your application,

166
00:08:15,326 --> 00:08:16,516
the amount of storage

167
00:08:19,276 --> 00:08:20,976
So now let's talk

168
00:08:21,686 --> 00:08:24,406
Stickers are a fun way and

169
00:08:24,406 --> 00:08:25,806
with other iMessage users.

170
00:08:27,146 --> 00:08:29,836
Your users can send

171
00:08:29,836 --> 00:08:32,256
like any other iMessage

172
00:08:33,515 --> 00:08:36,626
Or your users, not

173
00:08:36,876 --> 00:08:40,155
or your users can drag Stickers

174
00:08:40,326 --> 00:08:42,275
and attach them to

175
00:08:42,576 --> 00:08:46,026
And we believe this lends

176
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:48,076
and engaging messaging

177
00:08:48,616 --> 00:08:52,326
But what do Stickers

178
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:55,766
Stickers are basically images

179
00:08:57,256 --> 00:09:00,186
These images can be animated

180
00:08:57,256 --> 00:09:00,186
These images can be animated

181
00:09:00,336 --> 00:09:04,106
And we believe Stickers

182
00:09:04,106 --> 00:09:06,216
or promote any content

183
00:09:06,706 --> 00:09:09,116
And we generally think

184
00:09:09,116 --> 00:09:11,786
to be very, very popular

185
00:09:12,346 --> 00:09:16,466
So now let's talk about

186
00:09:17,086 --> 00:09:18,506
There are two ways to

187
00:09:19,066 --> 00:09:22,746
First, you can create a Sticker

188
00:09:23,406 --> 00:09:25,886
If you go down this

189
00:09:25,946 --> 00:09:28,206
to provide any code

190
00:09:28,566 --> 00:09:30,376
You only have to

191
00:09:30,376 --> 00:09:32,366
for your Stickers

192
00:09:32,866 --> 00:09:35,706
But if you want to

193
00:09:35,706 --> 00:09:37,206
you can do so by providing code.

194
00:09:37,256 --> 00:09:39,986
And your code in this case

195
00:09:39,986 --> 00:09:40,806
Messages framework.

196
00:09:41,496 --> 00:09:45,886
At this point let me

197
00:09:45,886 --> 00:09:48,966
to create a Sticker Pack

198
00:09:49,616 --> 00:09:55,956
So I have my machine here and

199
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:57,816
And here I'm going

200
00:09:57,816 --> 00:09:59,636
to create a new Xcode project.

201
00:09:59,706 --> 00:10:03,986
And under the Title of

202
00:09:59,706 --> 00:10:03,986
And under the Title of

203
00:10:03,986 --> 00:10:05,916
to select Sticker

204
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:08,226
And then I'm going to hit Next.

205
00:10:09,286 --> 00:10:12,026
And I'm going to name my project

206
00:10:12,436 --> 00:10:14,356
that I'm going to use are going

207
00:10:14,356 --> 00:10:17,826
to be assets depicting various

208
00:10:18,896 --> 00:10:19,716
So I click Next here.

209
00:10:20,936 --> 00:10:23,126
And for now just let me

210
00:10:23,126 --> 00:10:27,966
I'm done. Let me quickly

211
00:10:28,556 --> 00:10:32,556
Great. So, as you can see here

212
00:10:32,556 --> 00:10:35,646
in a Sticker Pack application,

213
00:10:36,396 --> 00:10:38,986
That is a very deliberate

214
00:10:39,226 --> 00:10:40,706
and so let me reiterate this,

215
00:10:41,076 --> 00:10:42,796
if you create a Sticker

216
00:10:43,026 --> 00:10:44,436
you cannot provide any code.

217
00:10:44,626 --> 00:10:47,116
You only provide the Sticker

218
00:10:47,986 --> 00:10:49,176
So let's see how to do that.

219
00:10:50,156 --> 00:10:51,256
I go into the Stickers --

220
00:10:51,676 --> 00:10:53,446
that's the Catalog which

221
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:56,746
One is the Sticker Pack and the

222
00:10:57,826 --> 00:10:59,136
I click on Sticker Pack.

223
00:11:00,036 --> 00:11:03,136
And, as you can see it says I do

224
00:11:03,136 --> 00:11:05,566
to drag and drop the

225
00:11:05,986 --> 00:11:07,186
So let me do that.

226
00:11:07,796 --> 00:11:11,976
So go to Finder and

227
00:11:12,366 --> 00:11:14,506
And I have some assets

228
00:11:15,566 --> 00:11:17,756
So I'm going to click on

229
00:11:18,066 --> 00:11:19,336
to drag and drop it here.

230
00:11:19,406 --> 00:11:20,956
So that's Golden Gate Bridge.

231
00:11:21,546 --> 00:11:23,806
I'm going to drag

232
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:24,726
That's Chinatown.

233
00:11:24,786 --> 00:11:28,486
And just to be quick

234
00:11:28,486 --> 00:11:32,166
to select everything

235
00:11:33,436 --> 00:11:34,666
Great. So I have all my assets.

236
00:11:35,696 --> 00:11:37,396
So these assets are a PNG type.

237
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:39,956
Xcode also allows you

238
00:11:40,016 --> 00:11:43,236
in your Sticker using the

239
00:11:44,056 --> 00:11:45,026
Let me show you how to do that.

240
00:11:45,026 --> 00:11:48,316
So I'm going to click, or

241
00:11:48,316 --> 00:11:50,406
and I'm going to

242
00:11:51,396 --> 00:11:53,476
And I'm going to say

243
00:11:54,516 --> 00:11:57,616
So when you create a new Sticker

244
00:11:57,616 --> 00:12:00,446
to provide the individual

245
00:11:57,616 --> 00:12:00,446
to provide the individual

246
00:12:00,566 --> 00:12:02,006
that you're about to create.

247
00:12:02,536 --> 00:12:04,236
So I'm going to go

248
00:12:04,236 --> 00:12:07,446
I'm going to click here where

249
00:12:07,986 --> 00:12:10,506
I'm going to drag

250
00:12:11,096 --> 00:12:14,236
I'm going to drag

251
00:12:15,116 --> 00:12:16,006
Third one.

252
00:12:17,076 --> 00:12:18,086
And finally the fourth one.

253
00:12:19,266 --> 00:12:21,586
Now let's go back to Xcode

254
00:12:21,726 --> 00:12:24,426
So as you can see, I

255
00:12:24,426 --> 00:12:26,196
of the Sticker here and click

256
00:12:26,196 --> 00:12:28,856
in its center will actually

257
00:12:28,856 --> 00:12:29,406
Looks good.

258
00:12:30,526 --> 00:12:32,316
Now let me just throw

259
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:37,686
I go to the App Icon Catalog.

260
00:12:37,686 --> 00:12:44,986
I go in here and I select

261
00:12:45,466 --> 00:12:46,306
Looks like I may

262
00:12:46,306 --> 00:12:47,606
Let me quickly do

263
00:12:52,096 --> 00:12:52,706
All right.

264
00:12:52,706 --> 00:12:54,106
So I provided the app icons.

265
00:12:54,716 --> 00:12:55,866
At this point I'm ready.

266
00:12:56,046 --> 00:12:56,906
My app is done.

267
00:12:57,106 --> 00:12:59,206
So let me try and see

268
00:12:59,726 --> 00:13:01,956
I'm going to go here

269
00:12:59,726 --> 00:13:01,956
I'm going to go here

270
00:13:01,956 --> 00:13:02,906
against the simulator.

271
00:13:03,676 --> 00:13:05,206
I'm going to select iPhone 6s

272
00:13:05,206 --> 00:13:06,576
as the device I want

273
00:13:07,886 --> 00:13:09,866
And I'm going to go to Product

274
00:13:10,496 --> 00:13:14,436
I'm just going to wait

275
00:13:15,046 --> 00:13:16,506
Great. So Messages has shown up

276
00:13:16,506 --> 00:13:17,906
and since I'm creating

277
00:13:17,906 --> 00:13:19,606
I'm testing it against Messages.

278
00:13:20,486 --> 00:13:21,326
And I'm going to run it.

279
00:13:23,056 --> 00:13:24,286
And the simulator is launching.

280
00:13:24,576 --> 00:13:29,126
Great. So here you can see I

281
00:13:29,126 --> 00:13:30,566
in Messages in the simulator.

282
00:13:31,526 --> 00:13:34,226
By simulated conversation what

283
00:13:34,226 --> 00:13:36,226
of them and send a

284
00:13:36,226 --> 00:13:38,886
up as an incoming message

285
00:13:39,566 --> 00:13:42,616
And just to clarify, you will

286
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:45,856
out of the simulator

287
00:13:46,516 --> 00:13:50,536
So going into the first one

288
00:13:51,046 --> 00:13:54,506
And at this point I'm

289
00:13:54,836 --> 00:13:56,776
As you can see, this

290
00:13:56,866 --> 00:14:00,676
Great. Now let me see

291
00:13:56,866 --> 00:14:00,676
Great. Now let me see

292
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:03,116
So I go in the App

293
00:14:03,526 --> 00:14:06,006
My application is ready

294
00:14:06,766 --> 00:14:08,066
I click on it.

295
00:14:08,836 --> 00:14:09,536
There you go.

296
00:14:09,746 --> 00:14:10,986
The assets have shown

297
00:14:11,426 --> 00:14:15,176
These are the same assets that I

298
00:14:15,926 --> 00:14:18,726
and look how they look like.

299
00:14:18,726 --> 00:14:20,796
And, as you can see the

300
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:24,286
And I can click on one

301
00:14:25,066 --> 00:14:26,436
drag them out of

302
00:14:26,436 --> 00:14:28,306
and attach to a message

303
00:14:28,956 --> 00:14:31,386
Great. And as you can

304
00:14:31,966 --> 00:14:33,196
go into the other conversation.

305
00:14:33,196 --> 00:14:34,026
I see the Sticker here.

306
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:37,566
So this is how you create

307
00:14:38,186 --> 00:14:40,766
However, there's one more thing

308
00:14:40,766 --> 00:14:43,606
and that is how to

309
00:14:43,606 --> 00:14:44,466
of this application.

310
00:14:45,196 --> 00:14:50,326
So going back to asset Stickers,

311
00:14:50,326 --> 00:14:52,116
to change the sizes of the cells

312
00:14:52,116 --> 00:14:55,736
in which your Stickers are being

313
00:14:56,716 --> 00:14:58,646
So to do that, let

314
00:14:59,826 --> 00:15:03,276
And I'm going to click

315
00:14:59,826 --> 00:15:03,276
And I'm going to click

316
00:15:03,906 --> 00:15:06,666
And as you can see,

317
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:07,696
by the name Sticker Size.

318
00:15:08,156 --> 00:15:09,276
I click on that.

319
00:15:09,276 --> 00:15:11,726
There are three options,

320
00:15:12,476 --> 00:15:14,446
And I'm going to click

321
00:15:14,446 --> 00:15:15,756
that changes my application.

322
00:15:17,196 --> 00:15:17,976
I run it again.

323
00:15:22,206 --> 00:15:23,836
And Messages is launched.

324
00:15:23,976 --> 00:15:25,376
Let me go back to

325
00:15:25,946 --> 00:15:28,746
And there you go.

326
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:32,406
As you can see, the Stickers

327
00:15:32,516 --> 00:15:33,986
and they're presented

328
00:15:33,986 --> 00:15:35,226
And there's more

329
00:15:35,466 --> 00:15:39,296
I'm going to go into more

330
00:15:39,296 --> 00:15:42,246
of changing the Sticker cell

331
00:15:43,206 --> 00:15:45,346
In that demo I showed you how

332
00:15:45,346 --> 00:15:48,206
to create a Sticker Pack

333
00:15:48,206 --> 00:15:49,786
and in this technique,

334
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:51,426
you do not have to

335
00:15:51,726 --> 00:15:54,666
You only provide the

336
00:15:54,706 --> 00:15:55,896
and for your app icons.

337
00:15:57,166 --> 00:16:00,356
I also showed you how to use

338
00:15:57,166 --> 00:16:00,356
I also showed you how to use

339
00:16:00,566 --> 00:16:03,876
to create an APNG Sticker

340
00:16:03,876 --> 00:16:04,746
of the APNG.

341
00:16:06,266 --> 00:16:08,166
And lastly, we also

342
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:09,816
to change the Sticker

343
00:16:09,816 --> 00:16:14,566
Now let's talk about supported

344
00:16:15,116 --> 00:16:16,506
We support four formats.

345
00:16:16,806 --> 00:16:19,826
These are PNG, APNG,

346
00:16:19,826 --> 00:16:23,066
And out of these four formats,

347
00:16:23,096 --> 00:16:25,586
if you want to provide

348
00:16:25,586 --> 00:16:27,476
we support APNG and GIFs.

349
00:16:28,346 --> 00:16:31,506
We are also making certain

350
00:16:31,936 --> 00:16:34,406
to make sending Stickers

351
00:16:34,406 --> 00:16:37,576
to other iMessage attachments

352
00:16:37,576 --> 00:16:39,386
on disk storage space

353
00:16:39,886 --> 00:16:42,536
And to help us make these

354
00:16:42,536 --> 00:16:45,596
to limit the file sizes for

355
00:16:45,596 --> 00:16:50,666
So as I just mentioned, we

356
00:16:51,196 --> 00:16:56,146
however, we do recommend that

357
00:16:56,146 --> 00:16:57,606
if not for all of your Stickers.

358
00:16:58,396 --> 00:17:00,826
Let's try to understand why

359
00:16:58,396 --> 00:17:00,826
Let's try to understand why

360
00:17:00,826 --> 00:17:02,506
by taking a look at

361
00:17:03,076 --> 00:17:06,786
So here I have two conversations

362
00:17:07,156 --> 00:17:08,736
but there's a subtle

363
00:17:09,286 --> 00:17:10,965
And so let me zoom in

364
00:17:11,066 --> 00:17:17,996
As you can see, the conversation

365
00:17:17,996 --> 00:17:20,506
on the photo and it

366
00:17:21,566 --> 00:17:24,806
And the conversation to the

367
00:17:24,806 --> 00:17:29,346
and the same Sticker but that

368
00:17:30,386 --> 00:17:33,306
If you observe carefully

369
00:17:33,826 --> 00:17:35,866
the one on the left,

370
00:17:36,306 --> 00:17:40,226
does not display any

371
00:17:40,436 --> 00:17:42,216
But the one on the

372
00:17:42,216 --> 00:17:43,766
is displaying certain artifacts

373
00:17:43,766 --> 00:17:45,146
around the edges

374
00:17:46,126 --> 00:17:48,036
Now this is happening

375
00:17:48,036 --> 00:17:51,776
and APNGs handle

376
00:17:52,136 --> 00:17:54,446
but GIFs do not handle

377
00:17:55,376 --> 00:17:58,016
And if you were to compare

378
00:17:58,016 --> 00:18:02,196
of JPEGs, JPEGs in fact do not

379
00:17:58,016 --> 00:18:02,196
of JPEGs, JPEGs in fact do not

380
00:18:02,196 --> 00:18:06,736
And hence keep in mind your

381
00:18:06,736 --> 00:18:09,116
out of your applications and

382
00:18:09,626 --> 00:18:12,936
and therefore transparency

383
00:18:13,126 --> 00:18:15,296
to consider while

384
00:18:16,266 --> 00:18:19,136
We also request you to

385
00:18:19,316 --> 00:18:21,526
on various colored

386
00:18:21,526 --> 00:18:25,326
and even multi-colored

387
00:18:25,326 --> 00:18:26,856
your Stickers can

388
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:32,336
In the demo I just showed

389
00:18:32,336 --> 00:18:35,176
of the cells in which your

390
00:18:35,956 --> 00:18:38,006
There are three supported

391
00:18:38,006 --> 00:18:40,286
and they are small,

392
00:18:41,196 --> 00:18:44,426
And for each of these sizes

393
00:18:44,426 --> 00:18:46,376
dimensions of the

394
00:18:47,096 --> 00:18:51,516
For small it is 100 by 100

395
00:18:52,206 --> 00:18:55,856
For regular it is 136 by

396
00:18:56,226 --> 00:18:58,906
For large the maximum

397
00:18:59,376 --> 00:19:01,376
by 206 points at 3x the scale.

398
00:18:59,376 --> 00:19:01,376
by 206 points at 3x the scale.

399
00:19:02,206 --> 00:19:06,376
If you provide Stickers that

400
00:19:06,626 --> 00:19:09,096
that are supported by the cell

401
00:19:09,486 --> 00:19:11,736
then your Stickers will be

402
00:19:11,736 --> 00:19:14,696
by Messages framework and in

403
00:19:14,696 --> 00:19:17,786
like exactly the way you

404
00:19:18,496 --> 00:19:20,496
But if your Stickers

405
00:19:20,556 --> 00:19:22,126
then they will be

406
00:19:23,316 --> 00:19:26,436
I would also like to clarify

407
00:19:26,656 --> 00:19:30,126
to provide us Stickers at

408
00:19:30,126 --> 00:19:31,806
of the resolution of the device

409
00:19:31,946 --> 00:19:33,676
in which your application

410
00:19:34,586 --> 00:19:37,356
Messages will take care of

411
00:19:37,786 --> 00:19:39,546
if needed according

412
00:19:39,726 --> 00:19:41,856
in which your Stickers are

413
00:19:42,406 --> 00:19:46,176
So that is all I had to talk

414
00:19:46,176 --> 00:19:47,646
and creating Sticker

415
00:19:48,016 --> 00:19:50,076
At this point I would like

416
00:19:50,076 --> 00:19:50,606
who is going to talk

417
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:52,336
about creating a custom

418
00:19:52,526 --> 00:19:52,816
Thank you.

419
00:19:53,516 --> 00:19:58,156
[ Applause ]

420
00:19:58,656 --> 00:19:59,466
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Bhaskar.

421
00:20:00,026 --> 00:20:02,576
My name is Lily and I'm an

422
00:20:02,756 --> 00:20:03,966
I'm going to talk to you

423
00:20:03,966 --> 00:20:06,256
about creating a custom

424
00:20:07,326 --> 00:20:08,806
First, why would you want

425
00:20:08,806 --> 00:20:10,416
to create a custom

426
00:20:11,016 --> 00:20:13,546
The first major benefit

427
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:16,446
to customize how you display

428
00:20:16,926 --> 00:20:19,756
In our previous example

429
00:20:19,756 --> 00:20:20,956
in a nice grid layout.

430
00:20:21,366 --> 00:20:23,566
However, if you wanted

431
00:20:23,626 --> 00:20:26,226
in any other format or even

432
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:28,706
you would need to create a

433
00:20:29,746 --> 00:20:32,626
A custom Sticker

434
00:20:32,626 --> 00:20:34,066
to dynamically create stickers.

435
00:20:34,546 --> 00:20:37,176
In our previous example

436
00:20:37,176 --> 00:20:39,016
into our application

437
00:20:39,016 --> 00:20:40,876
to update those assets

438
00:20:40,876 --> 00:20:42,436
to push an update

439
00:20:43,146 --> 00:20:45,206
If you want to pull your

440
00:20:45,206 --> 00:20:47,276
or allow you users to

441
00:20:47,276 --> 00:20:50,476
on device, they could do so and

442
00:20:50,786 --> 00:20:52,456
through the App Store.

443
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:55,816
Messages extensions will

444
00:20:56,196 --> 00:20:58,926
allowing your users to create

445
00:20:59,596 --> 00:21:03,986
And finally your application

446
00:20:59,596 --> 00:21:03,986
And finally your application

447
00:21:04,286 --> 00:21:06,176
allowing your users

448
00:21:07,086 --> 00:21:09,446
We can create a custom

449
00:21:09,446 --> 00:21:10,326
Messages framework.

450
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:13,156
Messages framework

451
00:21:13,156 --> 00:21:14,786
for creating a Sticker

452
00:21:14,786 --> 00:21:17,576
In our example of Sticker

453
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:20,716
through Xcode, they use the

454
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:23,546
so you could ideally create

455
00:21:23,546 --> 00:21:24,376
Messages framework.

456
00:21:24,676 --> 00:21:28,836
In the screenshot we have

457
00:21:28,836 --> 00:21:29,956
that's displaying Stickers.

458
00:21:30,246 --> 00:21:32,456
Well, you'll notice that the

459
00:21:32,726 --> 00:21:34,736
So I'm going to show

460
00:21:34,736 --> 00:21:36,036
and create an application

461
00:21:36,316 --> 00:21:37,416
So let's go into a demo.

462
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:43,766
So I'm going to open

463
00:21:43,936 --> 00:21:45,366
to create a new project.

464
00:21:46,876 --> 00:21:49,046
Bhaskar created a

465
00:21:49,046 --> 00:21:51,456
but this time we're going to

466
00:21:51,576 --> 00:21:54,326
So I'm going to go

467
00:21:54,326 --> 00:21:56,676
And I'm going to call my

468
00:21:57,086 --> 00:21:59,116
as we're going to

469
00:21:59,736 --> 00:22:01,846
And we'll go ahead and

470
00:21:59,736 --> 00:22:01,846
And we'll go ahead and

471
00:22:01,846 --> 00:22:03,746
and we'll put it on our desktop.

472
00:22:04,966 --> 00:22:09,186
Great. So you'll see here

473
00:22:09,376 --> 00:22:11,326
Nature Stickies and

474
00:22:11,796 --> 00:22:13,466
Nature Stickies does

475
00:22:13,466 --> 00:22:15,626
as this is the containing

476
00:22:15,926 --> 00:22:18,836
You'll provide an app icon

477
00:22:19,246 --> 00:22:22,526
However, we're interested in

478
00:22:22,746 --> 00:22:25,696
So we're going to go ahead and

479
00:22:25,956 --> 00:22:28,976
And we'll see that

480
00:22:28,976 --> 00:22:30,016
to be our principal class.

481
00:22:30,556 --> 00:22:33,346
It is a subclass of the

482
00:22:33,816 --> 00:22:37,546
The MSMessagesAppViewController

483
00:22:37,546 --> 00:22:40,006
that handles callbacks from

484
00:22:40,646 --> 00:22:42,686
We'll be talking more

485
00:22:42,686 --> 00:22:44,796
and how your application

486
00:22:44,996 --> 00:22:46,056
in Part 2 of our talk.

487
00:22:46,436 --> 00:22:48,756
So we can go ahead and get

488
00:22:49,756 --> 00:22:54,656
I'm going to select them

489
00:22:55,676 --> 00:22:58,376
Great. So let's take a

490
00:22:59,346 --> 00:23:03,106
If we click here we have an

491
00:22:59,346 --> 00:23:03,106
If we click here we have an

492
00:23:03,576 --> 00:23:05,296
The

493
00:23:05,296 --> 00:23:06,716
will allow us to

494
00:23:06,716 --> 00:23:08,476
It has two properties.

495
00:23:09,046 --> 00:23:11,756
It has an MSStickerBrowserView

496
00:23:11,756 --> 00:23:13,046
that our Stickers

497
00:23:13,046 --> 00:23:17,746
And it also has an MSStickerSize

498
00:23:17,746 --> 00:23:20,396
of our grid for the

499
00:23:21,096 --> 00:23:24,006
We'll also see that the

500
00:23:24,336 --> 00:23:24,946
conforms

501
00:23:24,946 --> 00:23:27,296
to the MSStickerBrowserView

502
00:23:27,866 --> 00:23:30,826
This protocol, when implemented,

503
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:33,406
of Stickers your

504
00:23:33,406 --> 00:23:36,536
and the Sticker at a given index

505
00:23:36,536 --> 00:23:38,696
So if we want to

506
00:23:38,696 --> 00:23:41,386
we'll need to create an

507
00:23:41,666 --> 00:23:43,576
And to implement the data

508
00:23:43,576 --> 00:23:44,336
and subclass this.

509
00:23:45,126 --> 00:23:47,676
So I'm going to go ahead

510
00:23:47,736 --> 00:23:52,116
And I'm going to choose

511
00:23:52,216 --> 00:23:55,306
And I'm going to call

512
00:23:56,026 --> 00:23:56,736
ViewController.

513
00:23:57,316 --> 00:24:04,036
Great. So I'm going to go

514
00:23:57,316 --> 00:24:04,036
Great. So I'm going to go

515
00:24:04,806 --> 00:24:08,956
And then I'll go ahead

516
00:24:10,246 --> 00:24:12,786
Great. So now let's

517
00:24:13,406 --> 00:24:17,266
I'm going to go ahead and

518
00:24:17,266 --> 00:24:19,256
ViewController class

519
00:24:19,256 --> 00:24:20,976
of the

520
00:24:21,676 --> 00:24:22,416
As I mentioned,

521
00:24:22,416 --> 00:24:23,996
the

522
00:24:24,436 --> 00:24:26,786
has two data source methods

523
00:24:26,876 --> 00:24:28,916
So I'll go ahead

524
00:24:29,906 --> 00:24:31,606
So now we'll need a way

525
00:24:31,606 --> 00:24:33,266
to create our Stickers

526
00:24:33,326 --> 00:24:38,836
I'm going to go ahead and create

527
00:24:38,986 --> 00:24:42,306
and we'll see that our

528
00:24:42,586 --> 00:24:45,716
And MSSticker is an

529
00:24:45,716 --> 00:24:47,176
that points to an asset on disk.

530
00:24:47,516 --> 00:24:49,696
It will also have a

531
00:24:49,996 --> 00:24:51,636
which will be used

532
00:24:52,586 --> 00:24:54,216
So let's go ahead

533
00:24:54,476 --> 00:24:58,086
I'm going to go ahead and

534
00:24:58,676 --> 00:25:02,916
I'm going to click Add Files

535
00:24:58,676 --> 00:25:02,916
I'm going to click Add Files

536
00:25:03,316 --> 00:25:05,946
and choose these assets here.

537
00:25:05,946 --> 00:25:08,966
And I've added them

538
00:25:08,966 --> 00:25:12,136
In this example we're just

539
00:25:12,376 --> 00:25:14,886
but you can imagine how your

540
00:25:14,886 --> 00:25:17,146
these assets from your

541
00:25:17,146 --> 00:25:18,136
to create them on device.

542
00:25:18,896 --> 00:25:20,586
So now we'll need

543
00:25:22,576 --> 00:25:24,766
So we'll write a

544
00:25:25,886 --> 00:25:28,926
Great. So here we

545
00:25:28,926 --> 00:25:31,746
We create a file URL

546
00:25:31,746 --> 00:25:33,806
and then we initialize

547
00:25:34,206 --> 00:25:36,666
with a localized description,

548
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:38,936
So now let's go ahead

549
00:25:38,936 --> 00:25:40,226
that will load all

550
00:25:43,316 --> 00:25:46,936
Cool. So now we can go back

551
00:25:48,066 --> 00:25:50,306
and create an instance.

552
00:25:51,376 --> 00:25:53,876
And we'll create a

553
00:25:53,876 --> 00:25:57,556
ViewController, and we'll

554
00:26:00,836 --> 00:26:04,756
Great. So now we instantiated

555
00:26:05,046 --> 00:26:06,176
with a Sticker size.

556
00:26:06,556 --> 00:26:09,316
This will allow your application

557
00:26:09,316 --> 00:26:11,206
in the grid layouts that

558
00:26:11,846 --> 00:26:14,176
So this application will

559
00:26:14,176 --> 00:26:16,166
like we did through

560
00:26:16,486 --> 00:26:18,016
So let's go ahead

561
00:26:18,086 --> 00:26:20,226
I'm going to write a

562
00:26:20,226 --> 00:26:22,976
to change the background color

563
00:26:24,556 --> 00:26:26,026
So we'll write that

564
00:26:26,026 --> 00:26:28,296
And we're just changing

565
00:26:28,296 --> 00:26:29,516
of the MSStickerBrowserView.

566
00:26:29,516 --> 00:26:31,026
And I'm going to go back

567
00:26:31,026 --> 00:26:36,966
to the MessagesViewController

568
00:26:36,966 --> 00:26:39,596
So now we can change

569
00:26:40,036 --> 00:26:42,466
And let's go ahead and

570
00:26:43,016 --> 00:26:45,956
So I'm going to choose

571
00:26:46,666 --> 00:26:52,416
and I'm going to hit Run.

572
00:26:52,606 --> 00:26:54,086
Oops. Oh, I forgot something.

573
00:26:54,086 --> 00:26:55,746
We forgot to actually

574
00:26:55,896 --> 00:26:57,466
So let's go ahead and do that.

575
00:26:58,176 --> 00:27:02,956
So I'm going to return the

576
00:26:58,176 --> 00:27:02,956
So I'm going to return the

577
00:27:02,956 --> 00:27:07,036
to return a Sticker

578
00:27:07,886 --> 00:27:08,996
And now we're ready to run.

579
00:27:11,056 --> 00:27:13,666
So I'll choose Messages as the

580
00:27:20,416 --> 00:27:23,066
Great. And now we can

581
00:27:23,136 --> 00:27:28,196
and then you'll see that

582
00:27:28,196 --> 00:27:29,296
because we forgot to add that.

583
00:27:29,596 --> 00:27:32,226
And we'll see that we have our

584
00:27:32,666 --> 00:27:35,006
In order to change what our

585
00:27:35,006 --> 00:27:38,026
to go into our project, click on

586
00:27:38,026 --> 00:27:39,576
and then we could

587
00:27:40,186 --> 00:27:45,426
But for now let's just see what

588
00:27:48,976 --> 00:27:52,306
So you'll see we now have an

589
00:27:52,406 --> 00:27:53,286
with a pink background.

590
00:27:54,096 --> 00:27:55,356
So this is one small example

591
00:27:55,356 --> 00:27:57,546
of how you can customize

592
00:27:57,946 --> 00:27:59,106
So let's go back to the slides.

593
00:27:59,916 --> 00:28:01,496
So to recap what

594
00:27:59,916 --> 00:28:01,496
So to recap what

595
00:28:01,996 --> 00:28:05,046
we introduced the

596
00:28:05,366 --> 00:28:07,316
This ViewController

597
00:28:07,316 --> 00:28:10,366
in your application using

598
00:28:11,036 --> 00:28:12,846
This controller also conforms

599
00:28:12,986 --> 00:28:15,276
to the MSStickerBrowserView

600
00:28:16,046 --> 00:28:17,756
This protocol will

601
00:28:17,756 --> 00:28:20,076
of Stickers your

602
00:28:20,126 --> 00:28:21,086
and the given Sticker.

603
00:28:21,326 --> 00:28:24,266
We also introduced the MS

604
00:28:24,766 --> 00:28:27,946
This ViewController is what your

605
00:28:28,406 --> 00:28:31,196
This MSMessagesAppViewController

606
00:28:31,236 --> 00:28:32,596
from the Messages application.

607
00:28:32,956 --> 00:28:34,946
Again, we'll talk more

608
00:28:34,946 --> 00:28:37,106
and how your application

609
00:28:37,386 --> 00:28:38,866
So that was a small example

610
00:28:38,866 --> 00:28:41,036
of how we could customize

611
00:28:41,036 --> 00:28:42,446
by just changing the

612
00:28:42,766 --> 00:28:45,626
But what if we want to do more?

613
00:28:45,626 --> 00:28:49,696
Your application can add Sticker

614
00:28:50,136 --> 00:28:52,236
the MSStickerView

615
00:28:52,966 --> 00:28:54,766
So if we wanted to

616
00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:56,566
that displays Stickers

617
00:28:56,566 --> 00:28:58,366
than the

618
00:28:58,366 --> 00:29:01,866
does, we can do so by

619
00:28:58,366 --> 00:29:01,866
does, we can do so by

620
00:29:02,516 --> 00:29:05,266
On the example I have behind

621
00:29:05,626 --> 00:29:07,166
This application

622
00:29:07,166 --> 00:29:10,196
UICollectionViewController

623
00:29:10,856 --> 00:29:11,886
And each cell

624
00:29:11,886 --> 00:29:14,496
of the UICollectionView

625
00:29:14,656 --> 00:29:18,106
The MSStickerView is the class

626
00:29:18,106 --> 00:29:19,856
and drop functionality

627
00:29:19,856 --> 00:29:21,186
into the Messages transcript.

628
00:29:22,196 --> 00:29:24,316
So we also see that

629
00:29:24,606 --> 00:29:26,206
which doesn't have

630
00:29:26,516 --> 00:29:28,556
Tapping it will expand

631
00:29:28,986 --> 00:29:33,856
allow us to choose a Sticker,

632
00:29:33,856 --> 00:29:35,276
Also note that we were able

633
00:29:35,276 --> 00:29:37,636
to transition how our

634
00:29:37,916 --> 00:29:39,636
Your application

635
00:29:39,636 --> 00:29:41,866
in a compact mode

636
00:29:42,406 --> 00:29:45,216
Your users can also

637
00:29:45,216 --> 00:29:46,416
on the chevron in the bottom.

638
00:29:46,506 --> 00:29:49,416
So your application will have

639
00:29:49,416 --> 00:29:51,176
in a compact and

640
00:29:51,606 --> 00:29:53,706
So I'm going to show you how

641
00:29:53,706 --> 00:29:55,186
and create an application

642
00:29:55,386 --> 00:29:56,796
So let's go into another demo.

643
00:29:56,796 --> 00:30:01,776
So I'm going to open up an

644
00:29:56,796 --> 00:30:01,776
So I'm going to open up an

645
00:30:02,746 --> 00:30:03,906
And it's called Sticker Picker.

646
00:30:07,566 --> 00:30:09,236
And let's go ahead

647
00:30:09,846 --> 00:30:12,246
Great. So we're back in

648
00:30:12,656 --> 00:30:14,436
which is our principal

649
00:30:14,436 --> 00:30:17,136
subclassing the

650
00:30:17,976 --> 00:30:19,836
We had two views

651
00:30:19,906 --> 00:30:22,246
our UICollectionView

652
00:30:22,536 --> 00:30:24,576
and we also had a view

653
00:30:24,576 --> 00:30:25,956
to add Stickers to

654
00:30:26,336 --> 00:30:28,236
These two views are

655
00:30:28,236 --> 00:30:30,316
in a StickerPickerCollection

656
00:30:30,676 --> 00:30:32,386
and in an

657
00:30:32,916 --> 00:30:33,776
Let's take a look

658
00:30:33,776 --> 00:30:36,206
at the StickerPickerCollection

659
00:30:37,366 --> 00:30:39,346
The StickerPickerCollection

660
00:30:40,006 --> 00:30:42,736
subclass is a

661
00:30:43,196 --> 00:30:45,466
The items that we'll have

662
00:30:45,806 --> 00:30:48,536
So it can either be

663
00:30:48,836 --> 00:30:49,796
or it could be a Sticker.

664
00:30:50,096 --> 00:30:52,036
So let's go ahead and

665
00:30:53,136 --> 00:30:54,996
The Sticker cell has

666
00:30:54,996 --> 00:30:59,106
The MSStickerView will

667
00:30:59,806 --> 00:31:03,176
in order to handle animations

668
00:30:59,806 --> 00:31:03,176
in order to handle animations

669
00:31:03,476 --> 00:31:06,766
we would have to call

670
00:31:06,946 --> 00:31:08,746
when we are displaying

671
00:31:09,896 --> 00:31:10,676
So let's go back

672
00:31:10,676 --> 00:31:12,576
to the StickerPickerCollection

673
00:31:14,636 --> 00:31:19,536
Great. So when we create this

674
00:31:19,536 --> 00:31:21,206
to go ahead and create

675
00:31:21,896 --> 00:31:23,706
We'll create an AddStickerItem

676
00:31:23,706 --> 00:31:25,526
and then we'll load our

677
00:31:25,526 --> 00:31:26,586
in our previous example.

678
00:31:27,166 --> 00:31:29,426
We'll return the number of

679
00:31:30,036 --> 00:31:33,046
and we'll create Sticker

680
00:31:33,046 --> 00:31:36,316
for an item at a

681
00:31:36,486 --> 00:31:38,856
When creating the Sticker

682
00:31:38,856 --> 00:31:41,386
to assign the Sticker

683
00:31:41,386 --> 00:31:42,976
So let's go ahead and do that.

684
00:31:47,256 --> 00:31:50,876
So we have now put a

685
00:31:50,876 --> 00:31:54,276
And, as I mentioned, our

686
00:31:54,386 --> 00:31:57,696
And we'll need to be calling

687
00:31:57,816 --> 00:31:59,086
to control these animations.

688
00:31:59,366 --> 00:32:02,096
When we're going to display

689
00:31:59,366 --> 00:32:02,096
When we're going to display

690
00:32:02,096 --> 00:32:05,236
to call startAnimating and when

691
00:32:05,236 --> 00:32:07,036
we're going to want

692
00:32:07,546 --> 00:32:08,986
So we can write a

693
00:32:08,986 --> 00:32:10,756
if the Sticker is

694
00:32:11,206 --> 00:32:15,316
by loading the image file URL,

695
00:32:15,466 --> 00:32:16,936
and counting the frames.

696
00:32:17,256 --> 00:32:18,706
If we have more than one frame,

697
00:32:18,736 --> 00:32:20,466
we know that we have

698
00:32:21,296 --> 00:32:23,336
So we'll go ahead

699
00:32:24,826 --> 00:32:26,056
So we'll check to see

700
00:32:26,306 --> 00:32:28,706
if our Sticker cell

701
00:32:28,706 --> 00:32:31,216
And if it can, then we'll

702
00:32:31,216 --> 00:32:36,966
And then when we're done

703
00:32:36,966 --> 00:32:41,026
ahead and check if our Sticker

704
00:32:41,026 --> 00:32:42,366
we'll call stopAnimating.

705
00:32:43,586 --> 00:32:46,226
Great. So let's go back to

706
00:32:46,226 --> 00:32:48,576
And we'll go ahead

707
00:32:48,576 --> 00:32:50,636
and instantiate the

708
00:32:50,636 --> 00:32:52,776
as that's going to be

709
00:32:52,776 --> 00:32:54,276
when we first launch

710
00:32:54,706 --> 00:32:57,026
So we'll do that in viewDidLoad

711
00:32:57,026 --> 00:33:01,486
When the user taps the

712
00:32:57,026 --> 00:33:01,486
When the user taps the

713
00:33:01,486 --> 00:33:03,026
to create the

714
00:33:03,026 --> 00:33:05,276
And then we're going

715
00:33:05,276 --> 00:33:06,216
into an expanded mode.

716
00:33:06,606 --> 00:33:09,216
We can do so by calling

717
00:33:09,336 --> 00:33:11,316
This will tell the

718
00:33:11,546 --> 00:33:13,526
that your application

719
00:33:14,176 --> 00:33:15,156
You'll then get a call back

720
00:33:15,156 --> 00:33:17,116
from the Messages

721
00:33:17,116 --> 00:33:17,856
this transition.

722
00:33:18,306 --> 00:33:18,546
So

723
00:33:18,546 --> 00:33:21,956
in didTransitiontopresentation

724
00:33:22,206 --> 00:33:23,786
and we'll first check to see

725
00:33:23,786 --> 00:33:25,676
if we have an

726
00:33:25,876 --> 00:33:28,936
And if we do and our

727
00:33:29,086 --> 00:33:30,576
we'll go ahead and

728
00:33:30,836 --> 00:33:33,916
Or else we'll present the other

729
00:33:34,206 --> 00:33:36,086
After we choose a Sticker

730
00:33:36,086 --> 00:33:37,156
to go back to compact.

731
00:33:37,266 --> 00:33:39,966
So we'll then again call

732
00:33:39,966 --> 00:33:40,806
.compact.

733
00:33:41,536 --> 00:33:43,216
So if we run our

734
00:33:43,216 --> 00:33:44,256
to see all of this in play.

735
00:33:44,456 --> 00:33:48,346
So I'm going to go ahead

736
00:33:48,346 --> 00:33:49,856
as the application

737
00:33:50,386 --> 00:33:55,236
And we're going to launch.

738
00:33:56,406 --> 00:33:59,996
I'm going to go ahead and

739
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:01,826
And we're going to

740
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:01,826
And we're going to

741
00:34:04,436 --> 00:34:09,556
and wait for it to load.

742
00:34:09,556 --> 00:34:12,746
Great. So now we can go

743
00:34:12,746 --> 00:34:16,235
And I'm going to choose

744
00:34:16,235 --> 00:34:18,985
And we'll see it

745
00:34:18,985 --> 00:34:20,565
And then we can send

746
00:34:21,996 --> 00:34:25,795
So to recap what we just

747
00:34:26,045 --> 00:34:28,866
we showed you how to create

748
00:34:28,866 --> 00:34:31,306
UICollectionView and

749
00:34:31,306 --> 00:34:34,036
of the UICollectionView

750
00:34:34,036 --> 00:34:37,696
The MSStickerView allowed

751
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:40,386
into the transcript and

752
00:34:41,606 --> 00:34:44,286
We also showed you how you

753
00:34:44,286 --> 00:34:45,866
to an expanded presentation

754
00:34:46,366 --> 00:34:48,936
And we also showed you how

755
00:34:48,936 --> 00:34:50,216
