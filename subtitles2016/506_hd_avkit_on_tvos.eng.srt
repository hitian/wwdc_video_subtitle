[ Applause ]

3
00:00:28,576 --> 00:00:29,076
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

4
00:00:32,266 --> 00:00:34,996
How many of you have apps

5
00:00:35,116 --> 00:00:36,186
on apps that play video?

6
00:00:36,636 --> 00:00:38,846
That's quite a few of you.

7
00:00:38,846 --> 00:00:44,216
Good. Whether for sports, news,

8
00:00:44,726 --> 00:00:50,126
What's the most important

9
00:00:50,206 --> 00:00:52,956
Is it the Play/Pause control?

10
00:00:52,956 --> 00:00:53,866
The scrubbing?

11
00:00:54,386 --> 00:00:57,506
Maybe the audio and

12
00:00:58,236 --> 00:01:01,706
No. Of course not.

13
00:00:58,236 --> 00:01:01,706
No. Of course not.

14
00:01:02,016 --> 00:01:03,556
It's the video presentation.

15
00:01:04,656 --> 00:01:08,676
So it's important when users

16
00:01:08,676 --> 00:01:11,656
and watching your video

17
00:01:11,656 --> 00:01:13,366
on your video presentation.

18
00:01:13,646 --> 00:01:16,366
And they aren't distracted

19
00:01:16,366 --> 00:01:17,756
out your user interface.

20
00:01:18,626 --> 00:01:24,306
That's why it's important

21
00:01:24,536 --> 00:01:28,076
consistent and predictable

22
00:01:28,076 --> 00:01:30,366
between apps on their Apple TV.

23
00:01:31,786 --> 00:01:35,386
Video playback on Apple

24
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:36,756
but it's no easy task.

25
00:01:37,066 --> 00:01:39,146
There are many different

26
00:01:40,046 --> 00:01:44,256
including the buttons and touch

27
00:01:45,056 --> 00:01:50,876
Siri voice commands, older Apple

28
00:01:51,586 --> 00:01:55,736
Bluetooth keyboards, game

29
00:01:55,736 --> 00:01:57,336
infrared universal remotes.

30
00:01:57,776 --> 00:02:04,386
Wouldn't it be great if you

31
00:01:57,776 --> 00:02:04,386
Wouldn't it be great if you

32
00:02:04,826 --> 00:02:06,956
I'm Dan Wright and

33
00:02:06,956 --> 00:02:10,586
about how you can accomplish

34
00:02:11,316 --> 00:02:13,996
AVKit provides modern playback

35
00:02:13,996 --> 00:02:15,636
with a consistent

36
00:02:16,276 --> 00:02:19,666
Let's take a quick look at some

37
00:02:20,386 --> 00:02:24,106
Here is AVKit playing a video

38
00:02:24,586 --> 00:02:27,516
with a transport bar visible

39
00:02:27,516 --> 00:02:29,876
the position in the video

40
00:02:31,426 --> 00:02:34,156
Touching the surface of

41
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:38,776
And clicking on the edges

42
00:02:39,096 --> 00:02:40,876
Or by holding down

43
00:02:40,876 --> 00:02:42,876
viewers can fast

44
00:02:44,486 --> 00:02:47,836
And when paused,

45
00:02:48,646 --> 00:02:51,096
on the remote will scrub quickly

46
00:02:52,886 --> 00:02:55,796
Swiping down reveals info panel,

47
00:02:55,796 --> 00:03:00,486
about the video and navigation

48
00:02:55,796 --> 00:03:00,486
about the video and navigation

49
00:03:00,486 --> 00:03:03,366
to settings related to

50
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:08,856
Finally, AVKit supports Siri

51
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:10,346
And as I go back

52
00:03:10,806 --> 00:03:12,006
or "What did she say?"

53
00:03:12,006 --> 00:03:14,276
to skip back 30 seconds

54
00:03:14,276 --> 00:03:16,116
with captions turned

55
00:03:17,466 --> 00:03:20,276
AVKit uses the modern

56
00:03:20,276 --> 00:03:22,756
the same as on iOS and macOS.

57
00:03:24,306 --> 00:03:26,606
AVKit provides the

58
00:03:27,756 --> 00:03:31,396
AVFoundation and CoreMedia

59
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:38,906
And UIKit or on macOS AppKit

60
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:43,236
Today we're going to

61
00:03:44,126 --> 00:03:48,116
First, we'll show you how easy

62
00:03:48,736 --> 00:03:50,736
Second, we'll look at several

63
00:03:50,736 --> 00:03:53,036
of the ways you can extend

64
00:03:53,036 --> 00:03:55,156
with features unique to tvOS.

65
00:03:55,806 --> 00:03:58,226
And third, we'll talk

66
00:03:59,426 --> 00:04:00,306
All right, let's get started.

67
00:03:59,426 --> 00:04:00,306
All right, let's get started.

68
00:04:01,706 --> 00:04:04,216
Let's talk about

69
00:04:05,226 --> 00:04:09,586
AVPlayerViewController uses

70
00:04:09,586 --> 00:04:12,066
and AVAsset provided

71
00:04:12,766 --> 00:04:16,266
The AVAsset represents

72
00:04:16,755 --> 00:04:20,386
AVPlayerItem represents the

73
00:04:21,116 --> 00:04:22,946
The AVPlayer controls playback.

74
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:26,876
And AVPlayerViewController

75
00:04:28,206 --> 00:04:33,206
Let's look at how you'll

76
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:36,356
There are four steps.

77
00:04:37,066 --> 00:04:39,286
First, create an

78
00:04:41,076 --> 00:04:42,816
Second, create a

79
00:04:44,516 --> 00:04:46,526
Third, create a player

80
00:04:47,076 --> 00:04:50,266
And fourth, associate the player

81
00:04:50,806 --> 00:04:55,386
Now, you can simplify

82
00:04:55,766 --> 00:04:58,506
to create the player directly

83
00:04:58,636 --> 00:05:01,056
to the player property of

84
00:04:58,636 --> 00:05:01,056
to the player property of

85
00:05:01,776 --> 00:05:03,376
All right.

86
00:05:03,996 --> 00:05:07,866
Next, let's see how you can

87
00:05:08,936 --> 00:05:11,506
First, you'll set up your

88
00:05:13,206 --> 00:05:15,756
Next you're going to set the

89
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,346
We're setting the

90
00:05:18,346 --> 00:05:20,506
but you should use

91
00:05:21,786 --> 00:05:25,496
And third, add the view from

92
00:05:25,496 --> 00:05:26,186
to your view.

93
00:05:26,556 --> 00:05:28,506
And add the playerViewController

94
00:05:28,506 --> 00:05:30,996
as a child view controller

95
00:05:31,606 --> 00:05:34,076
Now, once you're ready

96
00:05:34,076 --> 00:05:36,026
for interactive full-screen

97
00:05:36,026 --> 00:05:38,206
you can just present

98
00:05:38,206 --> 00:05:40,416
and it will automatically

99
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:42,836
from the inline playback

100
00:05:46,136 --> 00:05:47,096
All right.

101
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:50,596
Let's talk about extending

102
00:05:51,996 --> 00:05:56,906
AVKit for tvOS was introduced

103
00:05:57,246 --> 00:05:59,026
with several enhancements.

104
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:04,746
Namely, the ability to add

105
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:04,746
Namely, the ability to add

106
00:06:05,486 --> 00:06:07,106
Restrict playback interaction.

107
00:06:08,126 --> 00:06:10,976
Provide informational metadata.

108
00:06:11,286 --> 00:06:12,356
Navigation markers.

109
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:15,996
And identify interstitial

110
00:06:17,006 --> 00:06:22,776
With tvOS 10, we will introduce

111
00:06:23,236 --> 00:06:26,406
The ability to modify

112
00:06:26,976 --> 00:06:32,066
and presents content proposals.

113
00:06:32,816 --> 00:06:39,046
And now let's talk

114
00:06:39,646 --> 00:06:43,246
Overlays are for logos and

115
00:06:43,646 --> 00:06:46,946
The playback overlay view

116
00:06:47,986 --> 00:06:54,476
but below the controls.

117
00:06:54,476 --> 00:06:56,586
Views may be static or animated.

118
00:06:57,036 --> 00:06:59,856
But views will not

119
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:04,146
Let's move on to

120
00:07:05,316 --> 00:07:07,296
The requiresLinearPlayback

121
00:07:07,386 --> 00:07:10,656
of the player view controller

122
00:07:10,656 --> 00:07:13,136
when set to Play and Pause.

123
00:07:13,546 --> 00:07:16,216
Things like fast forward,

124
00:07:16,556 --> 00:07:20,006
chapter navigation and so on are

125
00:07:20,886 --> 00:07:24,116
Typically you'll set it to true

126
00:07:24,116 --> 00:07:26,056
of a particular section

127
00:07:26,056 --> 00:07:29,116
for example ads or

128
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:36,056
The external metadata

129
00:07:36,056 --> 00:07:39,106
or replaces information

130
00:07:39,486 --> 00:07:43,866
Things like title, description,

131
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:46,726
PG-13 or R, that sort of

132
00:07:47,546 --> 00:07:52,516
Let's go back to our screenshot

133
00:07:52,516 --> 00:07:54,176
that showed the info

134
00:07:54,956 --> 00:07:56,686
And I want to direct

135
00:07:56,756 --> 00:07:58,636
to this top section right here.

136
00:07:59,326 --> 00:08:03,426
This is where the informational

137
00:07:59,326 --> 00:08:03,426
This is where the informational

138
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:07,086
Now, in addition, it'll also be

139
00:08:08,756 --> 00:08:11,136
Here we see the artwork,

140
00:08:11,136 --> 00:08:12,796
like a still from the video.

141
00:08:13,436 --> 00:08:14,866
We have the title.

142
00:08:14,866 --> 00:08:17,686
We have the duration, which

143
00:08:17,836 --> 00:08:20,546
a media content rating

144
00:08:23,146 --> 00:08:24,416
Now, let's look at

145
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:26,636
to create external

146
00:08:27,236 --> 00:08:31,276
And we will create a

147
00:08:31,276 --> 00:08:32,525
to make it a little easier.

148
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:36,486
The first one called

149
00:08:36,546 --> 00:08:37,256
and a value.

150
00:08:37,296 --> 00:08:39,486
And it's going to

151
00:08:40,655 --> 00:08:43,996
And so metadataItem has a

152
00:08:44,296 --> 00:08:47,796
You really need to set three,

153
00:08:47,796 --> 00:08:51,366
the identifier, and

154
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:52,676
the extended language tag.

155
00:08:54,286 --> 00:08:58,246
Now, you see here I've set it

156
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:01,646
for undefined and it

157
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:01,646
for undefined and it

158
00:09:02,146 --> 00:09:05,546
So if you do not have a more

159
00:09:05,546 --> 00:09:10,456
available, this is the version

160
00:09:11,486 --> 00:09:13,886
If you don't have any

161
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:16,546
for example, is in English

162
00:09:17,026 --> 00:09:20,216
then just use und so that users,

163
00:09:20,216 --> 00:09:24,316
regardless of their

164
00:09:24,826 --> 00:09:26,816
Now, artwork is a

165
00:09:27,396 --> 00:09:32,666
The value of the artwork

166
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:33,766
image representation.

167
00:09:33,766 --> 00:09:34,636
So it's raw data.

168
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:37,766
You can use PNG or JPEG.

169
00:09:38,026 --> 00:09:40,866
You also need to set the data

170
00:09:40,866 --> 00:09:41,876
of data you're providing.

171
00:09:42,616 --> 00:09:46,176
And once again, you

172
00:09:46,176 --> 00:09:47,346
and the extended language tag.

173
00:09:47,346 --> 00:09:51,296
Now we're going to

174
00:09:51,456 --> 00:09:53,986
We're going to create several

175
00:09:53,986 --> 00:09:54,666
We create an array.

176
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:57,626
Then we're going to use our

177
00:09:58,386 --> 00:10:01,266
a description and the poster

178
00:09:58,386 --> 00:10:01,266
a description and the poster

179
00:10:02,076 --> 00:10:03,446
oh, and sorry, also the genre.

180
00:10:03,446 --> 00:10:05,656
And then finally we're

181
00:10:05,656 --> 00:10:08,576
to the external metadata

182
00:10:09,256 --> 00:10:09,466
All right.

183
00:10:10,956 --> 00:10:13,226
Back to our info panel.

184
00:10:14,506 --> 00:10:18,046
Now we're going to look down

185
00:10:18,486 --> 00:10:19,756
This is the navigation section.

186
00:10:19,756 --> 00:10:23,966
And this is displaying a

187
00:10:24,136 --> 00:10:27,396
Navigation markers most

188
00:10:27,786 --> 00:10:29,226
But they allow for easy access

189
00:10:29,226 --> 00:10:31,336
to different parts

190
00:10:32,056 --> 00:10:35,306
Navigation marker groups

191
00:10:35,626 --> 00:10:37,156
Examples of events would be

192
00:10:37,156 --> 00:10:43,816
in a sports video you might have

193
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:49,076
A navigation marker group

194
00:10:49,076 --> 00:10:51,396
of class

195
00:10:52,036 --> 00:10:54,866
And it contains an array

196
00:10:54,866 --> 00:10:56,826
in this case chapters.

197
00:11:00,336 --> 00:11:02,306
Every marker has a title.

198
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:05,826
And in most cases

199
00:11:05,826 --> 00:11:07,206
usually a thumbnail

200
00:11:07,756 --> 00:11:08,506
But that's optional.

201
00:11:10,096 --> 00:11:16,236
An event group itself also has a

202
00:11:19,276 --> 00:11:19,936
All right.

203
00:11:19,936 --> 00:11:22,626
Another little helper function,

204
00:11:23,026 --> 00:11:26,906
This takes a title, a

205
00:11:27,326 --> 00:11:30,566
Now, the time range is the

206
00:11:30,566 --> 00:11:31,806
that you're navigating to.

207
00:11:31,806 --> 00:11:33,736
However, the duration

208
00:11:34,056 --> 00:11:38,956
If you don't really care to set

209
00:11:39,606 --> 00:11:41,446
Here again, we're

210
00:11:41,446 --> 00:11:43,306
In this case, for a

211
00:11:43,306 --> 00:11:46,346
And then finally we're going to

212
00:11:46,386 --> 00:11:49,606
with our metadata

213
00:11:50,196 --> 00:11:54,156
All right.

214
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:55,906
Now let's talk about

215
00:11:56,626 --> 00:12:04,446
Here we see a video with several

216
00:11:56,626 --> 00:12:04,446
Here we see a video with several

217
00:12:04,446 --> 00:12:06,406
by the dots on the

218
00:12:07,866 --> 00:12:10,786
The user is watching

219
00:12:10,786 --> 00:12:14,136
And the time above the

220
00:12:14,136 --> 00:12:15,346
down the time remaining.

221
00:12:16,086 --> 00:12:24,786
The time below is the

222
00:12:25,426 --> 00:12:27,476
Interstitial content is content

223
00:12:27,476 --> 00:12:29,136
that is unrelated

224
00:12:29,136 --> 00:12:32,556
So for example, advertisements,

225
00:12:32,556 --> 00:12:33,536
other things like that.

226
00:12:35,276 --> 00:12:39,476
An interstitial time range

227
00:12:39,476 --> 00:12:41,836
of an asset that contains

228
00:12:43,386 --> 00:12:45,666
And interstitial

229
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:49,086
The dots on the transfer bar

230
00:12:49,086 --> 00:12:49,836
in the previous slide.

231
00:12:51,256 --> 00:12:55,356
And finally, during scrubbing,

232
00:12:55,356 --> 00:12:58,576
So the user just is navigating

233
00:12:58,576 --> 00:12:59,686
and they're not getting

234
00:12:59,686 --> 00:13:04,386
by ads popping ups

235
00:12:59,686 --> 00:13:04,386
by ads popping ups

236
00:13:05,256 --> 00:13:09,236
Now here we have a diagram

237
00:13:09,236 --> 00:13:12,936
of your asset on the top

238
00:13:12,936 --> 00:13:14,346
by the user on the bottom.

239
00:13:14,646 --> 00:13:17,446
We have a nine minute asset

240
00:13:19,076 --> 00:13:21,316
both of which are going

241
00:13:21,536 --> 00:13:23,256
And you'll notice

242
00:13:23,626 --> 00:13:27,246
on the transfer bar has

243
00:13:27,246 --> 00:13:29,786
or rather the duration

244
00:13:30,346 --> 00:13:37,346
Now let's look at creating and

245
00:13:38,656 --> 00:13:44,076
First, on your server you should

246
00:13:44,076 --> 00:13:46,846
directly into your HLS asset.

247
00:13:47,496 --> 00:13:50,576
Then, in your client app,

248
00:13:50,926 --> 00:13:53,556
you will declare the

249
00:13:54,036 --> 00:13:56,956
And implement a few

250
00:13:56,956 --> 00:13:58,296
to enforce playback policy.

251
00:14:00,216 --> 00:14:02,776
Here's a short snippet

252
00:14:02,776 --> 00:14:04,876
to declare the interstitial

253
00:14:05,186 --> 00:14:09,286
For each interstitial create

254
00:14:10,246 --> 00:14:12,496
Then set the

255
00:14:12,496 --> 00:14:14,526
of your player item

256
00:14:15,276 --> 00:14:21,326
In this case we're just

257
00:14:21,326 --> 00:14:21,846
time range.

258
00:14:22,326 --> 00:14:29,596
Next, the delegate methods.

259
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:33,486
There are three important

260
00:14:33,486 --> 00:14:34,496
The first is willPresent.

261
00:14:35,536 --> 00:14:37,236
willPresent is called when one

262
00:14:37,506 --> 00:14:40,026
of your interstitials

263
00:14:41,836 --> 00:14:44,276
Typically, this is

264
00:14:44,276 --> 00:14:47,496
to change requiresLinearPlayback

265
00:14:48,206 --> 00:14:50,036
So for example, if this

266
00:14:50,036 --> 00:14:52,846
you probably need, for

267
00:14:52,846 --> 00:14:55,316
to require the user to watch

268
00:14:55,316 --> 00:14:55,836
they start.

269
00:14:56,606 --> 00:14:57,326
You set it to true.

270
00:14:57,326 --> 00:14:58,376
Then they can't skip out.

271
00:14:58,376 --> 00:15:01,566
They could still pause,

272
00:14:58,376 --> 00:15:01,566
They could still pause,

273
00:15:01,566 --> 00:15:03,776
or something and come back.

274
00:15:03,776 --> 00:15:06,346
But they can't navigate,

275
00:15:06,346 --> 00:15:08,386
over it once they're inside.

276
00:15:10,316 --> 00:15:12,896
didPresent is called at the

277
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:15,736
And usually you set

278
00:15:15,736 --> 00:15:18,056
to False so that the users

279
00:15:18,556 --> 00:15:20,996
And finally,

280
00:15:22,566 --> 00:15:27,886
timeToSeekAfterUserNavigatedFrom

281
00:15:28,106 --> 00:15:32,326
So this is called when the

282
00:15:32,326 --> 00:15:34,646
that they want to navigate to

283
00:15:34,646 --> 00:15:38,716
For example, they

284
00:15:38,716 --> 00:15:40,486
They scrub and hit Play again.

285
00:15:40,746 --> 00:15:43,446
Or they use the navigation

286
00:15:43,446 --> 00:15:44,616
to another part in your video.

287
00:15:45,776 --> 00:15:47,816
The oldTime is the time

288
00:15:47,816 --> 00:15:49,006
at just before they skipped.

289
00:15:49,456 --> 00:15:52,246
The targetTime is the time

290
00:15:53,116 --> 00:15:55,816
The time returned

291
00:15:55,816 --> 00:15:58,666
where you want playback

292
00:15:59,776 --> 00:16:02,546
So by default, if you didn't

293
00:15:59,776 --> 00:16:02,546
So by default, if you didn't

294
00:16:02,546 --> 00:16:04,896
it would resume at

295
00:16:04,896 --> 00:16:07,366
AVKit would seek to the target

296
00:16:07,486 --> 00:16:10,826
If you provide the start time

297
00:16:10,826 --> 00:16:14,336
AVKit will automatically

298
00:16:15,396 --> 00:16:17,596
Now, if you do redirect

299
00:16:18,386 --> 00:16:21,396
unlike in our very simple sample

300
00:16:21,396 --> 00:16:22,826
to save the target time.

301
00:16:23,226 --> 00:16:25,446
And when your interstitial

302
00:16:26,176 --> 00:16:27,606
seek back to the target time

303
00:16:27,606 --> 00:16:31,326
so that the user can once

304
00:16:31,326 --> 00:16:33,036
that they wanted to watch.

305
00:16:33,206 --> 00:16:36,096
Now let's turn to

306
00:16:39,036 --> 00:16:40,256
Here we see the skipping

307
00:16:40,256 --> 00:16:43,096
And this is a new skipping

308
00:16:43,346 --> 00:16:51,896
the skip by item indicator which

309
00:16:51,896 --> 00:16:54,606
which is the skip forward

310
00:16:55,386 --> 00:16:58,716
In tvOS 10 you can choose

311
00:16:58,716 --> 00:17:00,596
between these two

312
00:16:58,716 --> 00:17:00,596
between these two

313
00:17:01,016 --> 00:17:05,116
If your app is displaying

314
00:17:05,116 --> 00:17:09,266
or a TV show, it's probably

315
00:17:09,266 --> 00:17:12,915
to navigate skip 10 seconds

316
00:17:12,915 --> 00:17:15,976
to more easily find the scene

317
00:17:17,046 --> 00:17:19,386
If you have a series

318
00:17:19,386 --> 00:17:23,126
for example exercise videos,

319
00:17:23,256 --> 00:17:27,705
to let users easily skip to the

320
00:17:27,896 --> 00:17:30,266
or the previous video,

321
00:17:30,266 --> 00:17:32,376
around a little bit

322
00:17:32,856 --> 00:17:35,836
So, to accommodate that, you can

323
00:17:36,146 --> 00:17:38,556
There are two skipping

324
00:17:38,556 --> 00:17:40,006
The default, which

325
00:17:40,006 --> 00:17:42,316
or minus 10 seconds,

326
00:17:42,956 --> 00:17:44,506
And there are three properties

327
00:17:44,506 --> 00:17:47,026
in the PlayerViewController

328
00:17:47,026 --> 00:17:50,196
The skipping behavior

329
00:17:50,196 --> 00:17:54,316
and disable the skip forward and

330
00:17:54,886 --> 00:18:00,166
So let's look at

331
00:17:54,886 --> 00:18:00,166
So let's look at

332
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:01,766
of skipping a few seconds.

333
00:18:02,816 --> 00:18:04,556
First thing we're going

334
00:18:04,556 --> 00:18:05,596
to set the three properties.

335
00:18:06,546 --> 00:18:07,966
Select the new skipping

336
00:18:08,046 --> 00:18:09,076
In this case we're just going

337
00:18:09,076 --> 00:18:11,056
to always enable skip

338
00:18:11,056 --> 00:18:12,216
I'm being a little lazy.

339
00:18:13,006 --> 00:18:16,476
And then we're going to

340
00:18:17,376 --> 00:18:19,246
Skip to next item,

341
00:18:19,246 --> 00:18:23,156
to do is replace the current

342
00:18:23,156 --> 00:18:25,856
And skip to previous item.

343
00:18:25,966 --> 00:18:27,396
Same thing, but going backwards.

344
00:18:27,956 --> 00:18:34,436
Okay. Now for a demo

345
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:37,026
I'd like to welcome

346
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:37,886

&gt;&gt; Good morning.

349
00:18:46,206 --> 00:18:47,196
My name is Jonathan Long.

350
00:18:47,196 --> 00:18:49,716
I work with Dan on

351
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:52,886
And today, we are going

352
00:18:52,886 --> 00:18:55,406
to be demoing an app

353
00:18:56,386 --> 00:18:59,276
I have the project

354
00:18:59,336 --> 00:19:01,226
And this is the main

355
00:18:59,336 --> 00:19:01,226
And this is the main

356
00:19:01,606 --> 00:19:04,016
It is the subclass

357
00:19:04,686 --> 00:19:07,226
And we have a reference to

358
00:19:07,836 --> 00:19:11,746
We obtain this reference in

359
00:19:12,856 --> 00:19:16,676
In addition, we also create

360
00:19:16,936 --> 00:19:18,956
and an AVPlayer, which we assign

361
00:19:18,956 --> 00:19:20,686
to the PlayerViewController's

362
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:22,576
I'll go ahead and

363
00:19:22,576 --> 00:19:24,346
so we can see what

[ Music ]

365
00:19:27,046 --> 00:19:28,846
So here's our

366
00:19:28,846 --> 00:19:31,486
in full screen with all of the

367
00:19:32,116 --> 00:19:34,726
If I swipe down to

368
00:19:35,316 --> 00:19:36,616
you can see that

369
00:19:36,616 --> 00:19:37,906
of interesting information here.

370
00:19:38,426 --> 00:19:40,766
Most notably we are

371
00:19:41,546 --> 00:19:43,366
So the first thing we're

372
00:19:43,366 --> 00:19:46,166
to add some external metadata

373
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:47,576
so that info tab shows up.

374
00:19:49,206 --> 00:19:52,286
Jumping back into Xcode, the

375
00:19:52,286 --> 00:19:54,866
to do is we are going to

376
00:19:55,276 --> 00:19:57,906
To do this we need to

377
00:19:58,416 --> 00:20:00,586
add them to an array

378
00:19:58,416 --> 00:20:00,586
add them to an array

379
00:20:00,586 --> 00:20:02,346
to the

I'll go ahead and add some

382
00:20:08,046 --> 00:20:09,576
These probably look

383
00:20:09,716 --> 00:20:10,826
as they are the same ones

384
00:20:10,826 --> 00:20:12,376
that Dan showed you

385
00:20:13,346 --> 00:20:15,746
The first creates and

386
00:20:16,216 --> 00:20:18,416
setting the data

387
00:20:19,636 --> 00:20:21,636
The second creates

388
00:20:21,956 --> 00:20:23,286
for all other value types,

389
00:20:23,486 --> 00:20:26,226
setting the extendedLanguageTag

390
00:20:26,736 --> 00:20:30,506
Now, I have one more

391
00:20:31,276 --> 00:20:34,956
that takes a dictionary

392
00:20:35,306 --> 00:20:38,826
And it simply maps the key

393
00:20:39,146 --> 00:20:40,786
to create AVMetadataItems

394
00:20:40,786 --> 00:20:43,446
and returns an array

395
00:20:44,536 --> 00:20:47,546
So now with these

396
00:20:47,986 --> 00:20:51,746
we can set the

397
00:20:51,746 --> 00:20:57,596
property to be our array

398
00:20:58,126 --> 00:21:00,336
Cool. So we created

399
00:20:58,126 --> 00:21:00,336
Cool. So we created

400
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:02,936
added them to an array,

401
00:21:02,936 --> 00:21:04,526
to the

402
00:21:04,526 --> 00:21:04,976
property.

403
00:21:06,256 --> 00:21:09,146
So now let's move on and

404
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:13,956
I have some helper

405
00:21:14,546 --> 00:21:17,636
The first creates an

406
00:21:17,846 --> 00:21:22,306
with a title, a description

407
00:21:22,856 --> 00:21:27,696
The second creates an

408
00:21:28,236 --> 00:21:33,186
with a name and four

409
00:21:33,216 --> 00:21:36,146
that represent different

410
00:21:36,856 --> 00:21:39,816
So now with these functions,

411
00:21:39,976 --> 00:21:43,346
I can set the

412
00:21:43,346 --> 00:21:49,446
on the playerItem to be an array

413
00:21:50,016 --> 00:21:52,076
We'll name this one

414
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:56,946
Cool. So we created an

415
00:21:57,116 --> 00:21:59,716
with some time metadata

416
00:22:00,406 --> 00:22:01,586
We added that to an array.

417
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:03,066
And then we assigned the array

418
00:22:03,066 --> 00:22:06,476
to the navigationMarkerGroups

419
00:22:07,006 --> 00:22:11,926
So, let's build and run

420
00:22:13,366 --> 00:22:16,786
So here is our Player

421
00:22:16,786 --> 00:22:19,846
And I can swipe down

422
00:22:19,846 --> 00:22:22,906
And now we see in the

423
00:22:22,906 --> 00:22:27,196
that we've specified as well

424
00:22:27,196 --> 00:22:29,126
And if I select down

425
00:22:29,126 --> 00:22:30,766
one of the navigation

426
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:33,796
we can skip to that

427
00:22:33,796 --> 00:22:38,316
So with just a little

428
00:22:38,316 --> 00:22:40,746
to add external metadata

429
00:22:41,066 --> 00:22:43,596
to provide a rich user

430
00:22:44,776 --> 00:22:46,226
Now I'll hand it back

431
00:22:46,226 --> 00:22:50,606
about new APIs in

432
00:22:51,556 --> 00:22:51,646

&gt;&gt; Thank you, Jonathan.

435
00:23:00,876 --> 00:23:01,326
All right.

Content proposals.

437
00:23:03,986 --> 00:23:08,996
Content proposals are about

438
00:23:09,586 --> 00:23:11,836
You may have seen Up

439
00:23:11,836 --> 00:23:16,866
of your favorite apps such

440
00:23:18,046 --> 00:23:20,736
When you reach the end

441
00:23:20,736 --> 00:23:23,506
"The West Wing" you'll

442
00:23:23,506 --> 00:23:27,196
up to watch the next

443
00:23:27,196 --> 00:23:30,686
on until it's 3:00

444
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:34,506
Many apps implemented their

445
00:23:34,506 --> 00:23:35,606
And then it was kind of tricky.

446
00:23:37,196 --> 00:23:42,426
No more. With tvOS 10 AVKit

447
00:23:42,426 --> 00:23:46,106
to present your own

448
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:48,026
We call these Content Proposals.

449
00:23:48,966 --> 00:23:50,486
Here is one example

450
00:23:51,016 --> 00:23:52,776
[ Applause ]

451
00:23:52,776 --> 00:23:53,226
Thank you.

452
00:23:55,926 --> 00:23:58,266
Now, you have the entire

453
00:23:58,676 --> 00:24:01,286
So you're not limited

454
00:23:58,676 --> 00:24:01,286
So you're not limited

455
00:24:01,286 --> 00:24:02,496
This is just an example.

456
00:24:03,746 --> 00:24:06,436
In the lower right

457
00:24:06,436 --> 00:24:08,356
and some big buttons

458
00:24:10,276 --> 00:24:12,736
Up here we have the

459
00:24:13,686 --> 00:24:17,826
And here is the thumbnail

460
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:24,546
Now, a content proposal is

461
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:26,356
of class AVContentProposal.

462
00:24:26,856 --> 00:24:28,666
This is basically

463
00:24:29,896 --> 00:24:32,106
Now, there are several

464
00:24:32,106 --> 00:24:34,196
I'm not going to spend a

465
00:24:34,196 --> 00:24:36,226
But I want to highlight

466
00:24:37,826 --> 00:24:39,866
The first is

467
00:24:40,556 --> 00:24:44,516
This is the time within

468
00:24:45,486 --> 00:24:49,206
that you want your proposal

469
00:24:50,456 --> 00:24:53,996
So, if you specify the

470
00:24:53,996 --> 00:24:58,076
as a shortcut, that means

471
00:24:58,076 --> 00:24:59,626
at the very end of the video.

472
00:25:00,646 --> 00:25:03,786
However, if you're presenting a

473
00:25:03,786 --> 00:25:05,586
like that, you probably

474
00:25:05,586 --> 00:25:07,056
that the user may not

475
00:25:07,396 --> 00:25:10,096
And you may want to present

476
00:25:10,096 --> 00:25:11,766
of those end credits, in

477
00:25:11,766 --> 00:25:12,676
property accordingly.

00:25:13,166 --> 00:25:20,186
Next automaticAcceptanceInterval

479
00:25:20,186 --> 00:25:21,896
for your presentation.

480
00:25:23,056 --> 00:25:25,226
You can say, for

481
00:25:25,226 --> 00:25:29,316
Which means that if the user

482
00:25:29,316 --> 00:25:31,356
they take no action

483
00:25:31,436 --> 00:25:33,706
then the proposal will

484
00:25:34,056 --> 00:25:35,606
and advanced.

485
00:25:37,276 --> 00:25:42,096
If you don't set this, then your

486
00:25:42,096 --> 00:25:43,696
until the user takes

487
00:25:44,786 --> 00:25:49,406
Title and preview image

488
00:25:49,406 --> 00:25:51,466
of information that you

489
00:25:52,626 --> 00:25:55,176
You can, of course, provide

490
00:25:55,176 --> 00:26:00,196
as you like: Description,

491
00:25:55,176 --> 00:26:00,196
as you like: Description,

492
00:26:00,196 --> 00:26:01,606
to set a user rating,

493
00:26:02,266 --> 00:26:04,896
maybe additional suggestions

494
00:26:05,726 --> 00:26:10,476
And finally, the way you

495
00:26:10,476 --> 00:26:12,606
to set the next contentProposal

496
00:26:13,196 --> 00:26:15,246
on the current playerItem.

497
00:26:15,846 --> 00:26:19,376
So let's look at creating

498
00:26:22,046 --> 00:26:23,286
Well, this is pretty easy.

499
00:26:23,286 --> 00:26:25,256
We just create an instance

500
00:26:26,096 --> 00:26:27,866
We're going to specify

501
00:26:27,866 --> 00:26:29,466
for our

502
00:26:30,396 --> 00:26:32,656
This means we want it to

503
00:26:32,656 --> 00:26:35,366
This is a nice shortcut if you

504
00:26:35,426 --> 00:26:38,076
For example, if your

505
00:26:39,996 --> 00:26:43,326
And we're going to set the

506
00:26:43,686 --> 00:26:47,466
In this case, our proposal

507
00:26:47,466 --> 00:26:50,316
of a fictional TV show

508
00:26:51,206 --> 00:26:56,806
In this case we're going set

509
00:26:56,806 --> 00:26:58,356
of the content proposal, a URL.

510
00:26:58,356 --> 00:27:01,106
And we're going to set it

511
00:26:58,356 --> 00:27:01,106
And we're going to set it

512
00:27:02,386 --> 00:27:03,436
for our own use later.

513
00:27:05,326 --> 00:27:07,176
Now we assign the

514
00:27:07,286 --> 00:27:08,456
which should show the proposal.

515
00:27:09,816 --> 00:27:11,026
Naturally, this is

516
00:27:11,066 --> 00:27:16,996
for Season 9, Episode 1.

517
00:27:18,046 --> 00:27:20,946
And, once again, we've got three

518
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:26,616
shouldPresent is called

519
00:27:26,616 --> 00:27:28,126
is to be presented to the user.

520
00:27:29,146 --> 00:27:32,016
Now, you could take this

521
00:27:32,016 --> 00:27:34,256
and prevent the proposal

522
00:27:35,606 --> 00:27:38,786
But you can also use it as a

523
00:27:38,786 --> 00:27:41,026
up to prepare for

524
00:27:41,916 --> 00:27:43,806
And we'll show an example

525
00:27:45,306 --> 00:27:49,676
didAccept is called when the

526
00:27:49,676 --> 00:27:52,346
That means they want to watch

527
00:27:52,816 --> 00:27:57,486
It will also be called

528
00:27:57,966 --> 00:28:01,286
And didReject is called

529
00:27:57,966 --> 00:28:01,286
And didReject is called

530
00:28:01,286 --> 00:28:03,146
that they want out

531
00:28:03,146 --> 00:28:05,086
They want out of the video.

532
00:28:05,086 --> 00:28:11,656
They want to get

533
00:28:12,336 --> 00:28:15,756
Now finally, you will

534
00:28:15,756 --> 00:28:19,496
by creating a custom subclass of

535
00:28:19,496 --> 00:28:23,706
There are a few interesting

536
00:28:23,706 --> 00:28:25,766
Let's look at two,

537
00:28:26,316 --> 00:28:31,346
preferredPlayerViewFrame

538
00:28:31,346 --> 00:28:34,456
where you want the video to

539
00:28:35,426 --> 00:28:39,006
Now, the base class

540
00:28:39,006 --> 00:28:43,226
of the entire screen, in which

541
00:28:43,226 --> 00:28:44,086
to fill the screen.

542
00:28:45,016 --> 00:28:47,726
And your presentation controls

543
00:28:48,186 --> 00:28:50,566
However, you can specify

544
00:28:50,566 --> 00:28:52,696
maybe off to the side in

545
00:28:53,126 --> 00:28:56,326
to give yourself lots of space,

546
00:28:56,326 --> 00:29:00,016
with for your controls.

547
00:28:56,326 --> 00:29:00,016
with for your controls.

548
00:29:01,046 --> 00:29:04,306
And dismissContentProposal

549
00:29:04,306 --> 00:29:05,246
are dismissed.

550
00:29:05,436 --> 00:29:07,396
You can specify one

551
00:29:08,096 --> 00:29:12,796
Accept, Reject and Defer.

552
00:29:13,026 --> 00:29:17,856
Defer means the user simply

553
00:29:17,856 --> 00:29:20,776
get back to watching the

554
00:29:20,776 --> 00:29:22,496
I don't know, maybe they

555
00:29:22,496 --> 00:29:24,666
in the end credits if

556
00:29:25,516 --> 00:29:28,886
And then as the name implies,

557
00:29:28,886 --> 00:29:29,846
at the end of the video.

558
00:29:30,666 --> 00:29:36,126
Now let's look at responding to

559
00:29:37,746 --> 00:29:38,486
shouldPresent.

560
00:29:38,796 --> 00:29:41,666
In this case, we're going

561
00:29:41,986 --> 00:29:45,386
of our custom

562
00:29:45,386 --> 00:29:46,866
subclass and assign it

563
00:29:46,926 --> 00:29:48,826
to the

564
00:29:48,826 --> 00:29:49,296
property

565
00:29:49,436 --> 00:29:51,736
of the playerViewController

566
00:29:52,956 --> 00:29:56,006
This lets us set that up

567
00:29:56,006 --> 00:29:57,796
when we know we're going

568
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:59,756
and not allocate

569
00:30:00,036 --> 00:30:03,636
that the user may never get to.

570

00:30:12,056 --> 00:30:12,966
Pretty straightforward.

We've seen this code

by subclassing

592
00:31:03,246 --> 00:31:05,226
So the first thing we

593
00:31:05,226 --> 00:31:08,596
to create a custom subclass of

594
00:31:09,686 --> 00:31:11,546
I have one right here

595
00:31:11,546 --> 00:31:12,936
and add to our project.

596
00:31:20,216 --> 00:31:23,166
So, this is our

597
00:31:23,796 --> 00:31:26,926
It is a subclass of

598
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:30,016
And we have some

599
00:31:30,016 --> 00:31:33,586
such as a UIImageView,

600
00:31:34,496 --> 00:31:37,206
We override the

601
00:31:37,446 --> 00:31:42,036
to return the CGRect that we

602
00:31:42,036 --> 00:31:45,866
view to animate to when the

603
00:31:47,716 --> 00:31:48,526
Now, the rest

604

of the viewController

605
00:31:50,526 --> 00:31:52,006
of its view and subviews.

606
00:31:52,356 --> 00:31:54,646
So we'll jump back into

607
00:31:56,126 --> 00:31:57,916
So there's two more

608
00:31:58,526 --> 00:32:01,956
First, we need to create an

609
00:31:58,526 --> 00:32:01,956
First, we need to create an

610
00:32:02,306 --> 00:32:02,956
and assign it

611
00:32:03,006 --> 00:32:06,496
to the playerItem's next

612
00:32:13,046 --> 00:32:18,066
So, here we are creating an

613
00:32:18,066 --> 00:32:22,936
We have a transition time,

614
00:32:23,736 --> 00:32:26,576
We're also setting the

615
00:32:26,576 --> 00:32:27,816
to be 15 seconds.

616
00:32:28,726 --> 00:32:32,206
In addition, we set the

617
00:32:32,206 --> 00:32:36,006
on this content proposal that

618
00:32:36,006 --> 00:32:39,246
that will be played if the user

619
00:32:40,536 --> 00:32:44,406
Finally, we set the

620
00:32:44,546 --> 00:32:49,576
as the next contentProposal

621
00:32:50,456 --> 00:32:52,866
So the next thing we need to

622
00:32:52,866 --> 00:32:55,666
to do, is implement two

623
00:32:55,666 --> 00:32:56,556
delegate methods.

624
00:32:56,996 --> 00:33:00,626

You can see here that we set the

00:33:00,626 --> 00:33:01,136
to Self.

627
00:33:01,246 --> 00:33:04,336
And the two methods that we need

628
00:33:04,336 --> 00:33:08,126
to implement are

629
00:33:08,796 --> 00:33:10,976
and didAccept.

630
00:33:11,996 --> 00:33:15,766
So in shouldPresentProposal

of our custom subclass of

632
00:33:19,606 --> 00:33:22,516
and we assign that as the

633
00:33:22,756 --> 00:33:24,196

634
00:33:25,696 --> 00:33:27,826

635
00:33:27,826 --> 00:33:29,946
that the contentProposal

636
00:33:30,316 --> 00:33:34,166
And finally, in didAccept,

637
00:33:34,626 --> 00:33:36,746
we need to handle

638
00:33:36,746 --> 00:33:37,876
to the next playerItem.

639
00:33:38,756 --> 00:33:44,136
So, to do this, we get the

640
00:33:45,156 --> 00:33:47,516
We create an AVPlayerItem

641
00:33:47,586 --> 00:33:51,456
And then we simply replace the

642
00:33:51,836 --> 00:33:53,306

00:33:54,256 --> 00:33:56,386

that you may have

687
00:36:17,936 --> 00:36:19,286
or hiding the controls.

This is for indicating

689

you're saying we don't want

691
00:36:28,906 --> 00:36:30,536
So if you toggle

692
00:36:30,536 --> 00:36:31,906
what you're doing is

693
00:36:31,946 --> 00:36:34,196
to destroy all the

Second, some people hate this,

698
00:36:42,616 --> 00:36:45,406
but avoid adding supplemental

699
00:36:45,406 --> 00:36:47,056
because it's going

700
00:36:47,116 --> 00:36:48,686
People will not discover them.

701
00:36:49,646 --> 00:36:53,086
And by the same token, do not

702
00:36:53,486 --> 00:36:54,936
or touch service gestures.

00:36:55,586 --> 00:36:57,386
Not only will that

704

but you'll likely

706

Now, some more general tips.

707
00:37:06,136 --> 00:37:08,926
Replace your asset if

If you don't respond to this

710
00:37:14,156 --> 00:37:16,846
and the media services

711
00:37:18,226 --> 00:37:19,566
video playback will fail.

712
00:37:19,566 --> 00:37:21,716
And the user won't be able

713
00:37:21,716 --> 00:37:24,126
to do anything except,

714
00:37:24,546 --> 00:37:25,766
So what they'll have

715
00:37:25,766 --> 00:37:27,256
go back to your menu

716
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:29,056
If you catch this error

717
00:37:29,056 --> 00:37:32,206
and automatically replace

718
00:37:32,206 --> 00:37:34,986
and your player, basically

719
00:37:35,486 --> 00:37:38,386
then you can more

720
00:37:38,386 --> 00:37:40,686
And the user will barely even

721
00:37:42,276 --> 00:37:44,796

722
00:37:44,796 --> 00:37:47,136

for both AVKit and

to work well together.

731
00:38:04,446 --> 00:38:11,506
