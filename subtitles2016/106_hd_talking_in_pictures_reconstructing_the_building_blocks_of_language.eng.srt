00:00:26,136 --> 00:00:27,536
&gt;&gt; Hi. Good morning.

3
00:00:28,696 --> 00:00:29,346
Good afternoon.

4
00:00:30,376 --> 00:00:35,476
My name is Ajit, and I used

5
00:00:35,476 --> 00:00:37,666
from here on the East Bay.

6
00:00:38,386 --> 00:00:41,716
I was an electrical engineer in

7
00:00:42,846 --> 00:00:46,606
And in 2007, I did

8
00:00:46,606 --> 00:00:50,886
I moved back to India from

9
00:00:50,916 --> 00:00:51,856
to be an entrepreneur.

10
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:57,326
I'm an inventor at heart,

11
00:00:57,326 --> 00:00:59,836
of different fields, a

12
00:01:00,806 --> 00:01:03,756
But eventually, I

13
00:01:03,756 --> 00:01:05,406
on that was rather

14
00:01:05,556 --> 00:01:09,356
I decided I wanted to work

15
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:12,576
I wanted to make assistive

16
00:01:12,576 --> 00:01:17,116
who had difficulties with

17
00:01:18,576 --> 00:01:22,876
Now the way I got into

18
00:01:23,356 --> 00:01:26,546
when I went back

19
00:01:27,446 --> 00:01:28,696
there was a friend of mine.

20
00:01:28,696 --> 00:01:32,376
And she runs a school in the

21
00:01:32,376 --> 00:01:35,266
of India, and it's

22
00:01:36,496 --> 00:01:39,006
Now, Vidya Sagar is

23
00:01:39,006 --> 00:01:42,486
It's a school for kids with

24
00:01:42,486 --> 00:01:44,776
cerebral palsy, autism.

25
00:01:45,696 --> 00:01:49,266
And when my friend found

26
00:01:49,266 --> 00:01:52,026
for instant problems

27
00:01:52,206 --> 00:01:55,796
that I visit the school and

28
00:01:55,796 --> 00:01:57,966
if there was anything

29
00:01:59,496 --> 00:02:01,926
So I went to Vidya

30
00:01:59,496 --> 00:02:01,926
So I went to Vidya

31
00:02:01,926 --> 00:02:03,236
and I met some of the kids.

32
00:02:04,506 --> 00:02:06,496
Now that visit was

33
00:02:07,336 --> 00:02:10,286
You know, I saw that these

34
00:02:10,545 --> 00:02:13,086
they were smart, they

35
00:02:13,146 --> 00:02:15,046
they were enthusiastic,

36
00:02:15,946 --> 00:02:18,296
But the reason that they weren't

37
00:02:18,296 --> 00:02:20,876
in a regular school was

38
00:02:21,776 --> 00:02:24,206
And that was that they had

39
00:02:25,856 --> 00:02:30,356
Now, if you look at kids with

40
00:02:30,356 --> 00:02:34,006
that they can't communicate is

41
00:02:34,006 --> 00:02:36,786
that process muscle

42
00:02:36,786 --> 00:02:38,516
so they have difficulty

43
00:02:38,516 --> 00:02:41,726
of the different muscles that

44
00:02:43,326 --> 00:02:45,696
But with autism, it's actually

45
00:02:47,146 --> 00:02:49,746
The first kid that I met

46
00:02:49,746 --> 00:02:51,616
at Vidya Sagar during

47
00:02:52,106 --> 00:02:53,026
His name was Santhosh.

48
00:02:54,256 --> 00:02:57,006
Now I was sitting across

49
00:02:57,006 --> 00:02:59,466
and Santhosh had a lot of

50
00:02:59,466 --> 00:03:01,306
that we take for granted.

51
00:02:59,466 --> 00:03:01,306
that we take for granted.

52
00:03:01,526 --> 00:03:05,276
For example, he found it really

53
00:03:06,156 --> 00:03:09,256
He would find it really hard

54
00:03:09,256 --> 00:03:13,286
out what kind of emotion I

55
00:03:13,496 --> 00:03:15,116
The other thing that

56
00:03:15,116 --> 00:03:16,756
of difficulty with was language.

57
00:03:17,936 --> 00:03:20,766
Because language is

58
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:22,296
You know, it's very abstract.

59
00:03:22,826 --> 00:03:24,626
It's not something that

60
00:03:24,626 --> 00:03:28,766
but it's really one of the most

61
00:03:29,346 --> 00:03:31,606
We have all of these

62
00:03:31,606 --> 00:03:36,076
all of these different words,

63
00:03:36,076 --> 00:03:38,976
that we assign meaning

64
00:03:40,396 --> 00:03:43,406
For example, if I

65
00:03:44,426 --> 00:03:48,326
the word "dog" doesn't

66
00:03:48,326 --> 00:03:51,306
with the animal the way

67
00:03:51,306 --> 00:03:52,446
the way that I write the word.

68
00:03:52,446 --> 00:03:54,246
You would never be

69
00:03:54,246 --> 00:03:56,806
out that it actually refers

70
00:03:57,466 --> 00:04:01,316
It's very much abstract sound

71
00:03:57,466 --> 00:04:01,316
It's very much abstract sound

72
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:03,686
you know, a convention

73
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:08,356
And that's why someone

74
00:04:08,356 --> 00:04:09,356
of difficulty with this.

75
00:04:09,466 --> 00:04:14,246
Our brains have the ability to,

76
00:04:14,246 --> 00:04:17,116
of thousands of these

77
00:04:17,676 --> 00:04:21,555
But kids with autism find

78
00:04:21,896 --> 00:04:22,926
for their comfort.

79
00:04:24,236 --> 00:04:27,456
So my friend who runs

80
00:04:27,456 --> 00:04:30,536
she wanted me to look at

81
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:34,066
and she wanted me to see if I

82
00:04:34,516 --> 00:04:36,816
that could give a voice

83
00:04:36,816 --> 00:04:39,736
I thought that was a fascinating

84
00:04:39,736 --> 00:04:40,996
from a technology perspective.

85
00:04:41,546 --> 00:04:44,296
I also thought it was a huge

86
00:04:44,296 --> 00:04:46,856
because there were kids all

87
00:04:46,856 --> 00:04:50,786
over the world, who

88
00:04:50,786 --> 00:04:53,916
My starting point to

89
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:55,956
of assistive technologies

90
00:04:55,956 --> 00:04:59,336
that had actually been

91
00:04:59,336 --> 00:05:01,366
and the 80s and was being

92
00:04:59,336 --> 00:05:01,366
and the 80s and was being

93
00:05:01,986 --> 00:05:05,346
What people working with kids

94
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:09,536
that many of them have extremely

95
00:05:09,696 --> 00:05:12,476
So they have a lot of

96
00:05:12,476 --> 00:05:14,196
of language, but they

97
00:05:14,616 --> 00:05:16,446
with the concreteness

98
00:05:17,116 --> 00:05:18,946
They're able to remember

99
00:05:18,946 --> 00:05:21,756
They're able to recall pictures

100
00:05:21,756 --> 00:05:24,836
to do with sound

101
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:28,936
Even in India, it wasn't

102
00:05:28,936 --> 00:05:30,726
with books like these.

103
00:05:31,146 --> 00:05:34,726
Picture books, picture charts,

104
00:05:34,726 --> 00:05:36,036
that they would wear

105
00:05:36,556 --> 00:05:40,836
And if they wanted to ask for a

106
00:05:40,836 --> 00:05:43,796
to request for water for

107
00:05:43,876 --> 00:05:48,716
to a picture of water in their

108
00:05:48,716 --> 00:05:50,056
to other people that

109
00:05:51,076 --> 00:05:56,806
At that time in [inaudible]

110
00:05:57,706 --> 00:06:01,816
this concept was being used

111
00:05:57,706 --> 00:06:01,816
this concept was being used

112
00:06:01,816 --> 00:06:04,366
of these devices that

113
00:06:04,886 --> 00:06:07,536
And this is an example

114
00:06:08,086 --> 00:06:11,276
This is a fairly -- you know,

115
00:06:11,276 --> 00:06:12,226
They were pretty bulky.

116
00:06:12,766 --> 00:06:15,756
They ran a special

117
00:06:15,756 --> 00:06:17,086
They were often custom-built,

118
00:06:17,086 --> 00:06:18,776
and they were paid

119
00:06:19,346 --> 00:06:20,876
So they were pretty expensive.

120
00:06:20,926 --> 00:06:23,456
This device, for example,

121
00:06:23,646 --> 00:06:25,786
between $5,000 to $10,000.

122
00:06:26,106 --> 00:06:29,046
And that price point is

123
00:06:29,046 --> 00:06:32,236
for even the most affluent

124
00:06:32,906 --> 00:06:36,426
But what was happening

125
00:06:36,426 --> 00:06:39,316
for example, the

126
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:42,136
And that was the beginning

127
00:06:42,406 --> 00:06:46,106
Right? So it was possible

128
00:06:46,756 --> 00:06:50,306
to actually buy electronic

129
00:06:50,306 --> 00:06:52,166
which were being

130
00:06:52,536 --> 00:06:54,576
in these touchscreen

131
00:06:55,086 --> 00:06:59,116
And to assemble them together

132
00:06:59,476 --> 00:07:00,956
for a fraction of the price just

133
00:06:59,476 --> 00:07:00,956
for a fraction of the price just

134
00:07:00,956 --> 00:07:04,196
for a few hundred

135
00:07:04,196 --> 00:07:06,336
to create these things

136
00:07:06,856 --> 00:07:10,366
So that became my strategy

137
00:07:11,066 --> 00:07:13,106
I thought I would

138
00:07:13,226 --> 00:07:16,266
that they could use on top of

139
00:07:16,266 --> 00:07:19,036
from these smartphone

140
00:07:19,496 --> 00:07:23,426
and we would then use that

141
00:07:23,426 --> 00:07:24,096
to communicate.

142
00:07:25,246 --> 00:07:31,516
So I took this strategy and

143
00:07:31,516 --> 00:07:33,196
of creating assistive

144
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:38,686
And I quickly came up with

145
00:07:39,766 --> 00:07:43,716
You know, those of you who've

146
00:07:43,716 --> 00:07:47,676
for a specific class of people,

147
00:07:47,846 --> 00:07:49,596
of coming up with these

148
00:07:49,596 --> 00:07:50,256
pretty standard.

149
00:07:51,036 --> 00:07:54,336
You go to the field, you talk to

150
00:07:54,336 --> 00:07:55,266
you see what they have to say.

151
00:07:56,136 --> 00:07:58,096
You ideate to come up

152
00:07:58,096 --> 00:08:02,356
and you build these

153
00:07:58,096 --> 00:08:02,356
and you build these

154
00:08:03,306 --> 00:08:05,586
to the people whose

155
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:08,736
And then you get their feedback,

156
00:08:08,736 --> 00:08:09,996
of different times

157
00:08:09,996 --> 00:08:10,856
that works beautifully.

158
00:08:11,246 --> 00:08:12,886
You know, that process

159
00:08:13,206 --> 00:08:16,556
In my particular case though,

160
00:08:16,946 --> 00:08:20,396
Because the very reason that we

161
00:08:20,396 --> 00:08:22,366
because these children

162
00:08:23,706 --> 00:08:25,416
So it was a chicken-and-egg

163
00:08:25,586 --> 00:08:27,766
You know, we were

164
00:08:27,766 --> 00:08:29,546
and ask them what they thought

165
00:08:29,546 --> 00:08:31,086
about the prototypes

166
00:08:31,906 --> 00:08:33,456
But what would actually

167
00:08:33,456 --> 00:08:36,326
that the kids would use the

168
00:08:36,466 --> 00:08:38,635
two minutes, and then

169
00:08:39,405 --> 00:08:41,586
And we had no idea -- you

170
00:08:41,586 --> 00:08:42,436
Were they bored?

171
00:08:42,876 --> 00:08:44,006
You know, did they not like it?

172
00:08:44,265 --> 00:08:46,956
Did they think it was

173
00:08:47,446 --> 00:08:48,676
Were we solving the

174
00:08:49,646 --> 00:08:53,096
So that was a frustration

175
00:08:53,096 --> 00:08:55,696
we lived with for

176
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:58,966
You know, every developer --

177
00:08:58,966 --> 00:09:02,506
I'm sure every one of you here

178
00:08:58,966 --> 00:09:02,506
I'm sure every one of you here

179
00:09:02,506 --> 00:09:06,266
that's very close to your

180
00:09:07,056 --> 00:09:12,256
You know, in my particular case,

181
00:09:12,656 --> 00:09:14,906
His name was Rohit.

182
00:09:14,906 --> 00:09:17,566
Rohit was one of the

183
00:09:17,566 --> 00:09:19,256
out every single one

184
00:09:19,256 --> 00:09:22,026
And one day, he came

185
00:09:22,026 --> 00:09:23,716
where we were trying

186
00:09:23,716 --> 00:09:25,926
And I could see --

187
00:09:25,926 --> 00:09:28,196
I could see the determination

188
00:09:28,686 --> 00:09:30,436
He was going to communicate

189
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:35,056
He was completely -- he had

190
00:09:35,326 --> 00:09:37,336
as he walked into the room.

191

Believe me.

Because from that point onwards,

This device costs about $600

237

out how we could make

266

But it also was a revolution

267
00:13:35,186 --> 00:13:37,976
because we saw this as a

00:13:37,976 --> 00:13:41,136
out of this hardware corner

of these different categories.

And a parent, or a teacher,

288
00:14:45,836 --> 00:14:48,486

&gt;&gt; I feel excited.

305
00:15:21,426 --> 00:15:23,646
&gt;&gt; And then the app

306
00:15:25,366 --> 00:15:28,906
So that's Avaz -- essentially,

307
00:15:29,296 --> 00:15:32,536
with a picture vocabulary that

308
00:15:32,956 --> 00:15:38,086

00:19:04,266 --> 00:19:06,706
she got a call from a

380
00:19:06,806 --> 00:19:09,766
You know, so this

381
00:19:09,766 --> 00:19:13,086
And this call was actually --

382
00:19:13,086 --> 00:19:14,476
from most of the

383
00:19:14,626 --> 00:19:15,726
you know, for customer support.

384
00:19:16,266 --> 00:19:20,106
This lady had bought

385
00:19:20,106 --> 00:19:21,326
And, you know, she wanted

386
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:22,666
to know a bunch of

387
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:26,586
You know, she wanted to know

388
00:19:26,696 --> 00:19:28,956
for whether this device

389
00:19:28,956 --> 00:19:31,566
and she wanted to know how

390
00:19:32,476 --> 00:19:34,946
She wanted to know how to

391
00:19:34,946 --> 00:19:37,276
She wanted to know how to

392
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:39,326
She wanted to know how

393
00:19:39,826 --> 00:19:40,876
you know, over the months.

394
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:43,036
She essentially wanted

395
00:19:43,036 --> 00:19:45,246
to implement the

396
00:19:45,996 --> 00:19:51,836
Now this is actually a pretty

397
00:19:51,836 --> 00:19:55,476
Because in most installations

398
00:19:56,106 --> 00:19:59,066
a speech therapist would be

399
00:19:59,066 --> 00:20:02,656
with the kid in order to

400
00:19:59,066 --> 00:20:02,656
with the kid in order to

401
00:20:02,886 --> 00:20:04,076
So the speech therapist

402
00:20:04,076 --> 00:20:06,266
with the kid maybe once a week,

403
00:20:06,266 --> 00:20:07,496
they would do all of

404
00:20:08,256 --> 00:20:09,746
And so we asked this lady,

405
00:20:09,746 --> 00:20:11,886
"Why don't you ask your speech

406
00:20:11,886 --> 00:20:15,396
You know, that person is

407
00:20:15,496 --> 00:20:17,026
to give you an answer to

408
00:20:18,086 --> 00:20:18,786
On that day, I found

409
00:20:18,786 --> 00:20:22,916
out something very

410
00:20:23,256 --> 00:20:25,746
This lady's son didn't

411
00:20:26,936 --> 00:20:28,986
In fact, the closest

412
00:20:29,286 --> 00:20:32,006
to that lady was 300 miles away.

413
00:20:33,316 --> 00:20:35,346
If she had to find a speech

414
00:20:35,346 --> 00:20:37,806
she'd have to get on a

415
00:20:38,256 --> 00:20:41,726
and go to a speech

416
00:20:41,936 --> 00:20:43,026
In fact, I'll tell you this.

417
00:20:43,406 --> 00:20:44,916
In the entire country of India,

418
00:20:45,056 --> 00:20:47,136
the country of 1.3

419
00:20:48,256 --> 00:20:50,506
there are 1,800 speech

420
00:20:51,636 --> 00:20:53,846
You could take all of the

421
00:20:53,846 --> 00:20:55,726
and you could put

422
00:20:55,726 --> 00:20:58,466
and you could fill this room

423
00:20:58,466 --> 00:20:59,816
of speech therapists

424
00:21:01,736 --> 00:21:04,956
So this was a mind-blowing

425
00:21:04,956 --> 00:21:07,056
This was really an

426
00:21:07,056 --> 00:21:10,856
And what we had to do eventually

427
00:21:10,926 --> 00:21:14,486
Avaz, and we had to build this

428
00:21:14,486 --> 00:21:17,036
So it's almost like a

429
00:21:17,636 --> 00:21:18,916
And what that sub-app did --

430
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:21,676
it was a pretty new

431
00:21:21,676 --> 00:21:25,156
What that sub-app did was

432
00:21:25,586 --> 00:21:27,926
to be a therapist

433
00:21:28,336 --> 00:21:30,546
That was the only way that we

434
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:32,076
You know, as a startup,

435
00:21:32,076 --> 00:21:36,026
we couldn't train the 5 million

436
00:21:36,626 --> 00:21:39,486
But this was actually more

437
00:21:39,486 --> 00:21:42,726
than even Avaz itself because

438
00:21:42,726 --> 00:21:46,256
for the child, we were actually

439
00:21:46,866 --> 00:21:50,206
for these children to get

440
00:21:50,646 --> 00:21:56,666

00:22:01,186 --> 00:22:02,866
after we brought Avaz out.

that the Indian government has

the guy at Apple that was

of these devices, he told me

Today, there are

00:23:11,766 --> 00:23:14,896
around the world whose lives

473
00:23:14,896 --> 00:23:16,326
Avaz is an artificial voice

474
00:23:16,326 --> 00:23:17,936
for 30,000 children

475
00:23:18,996 --> 00:23:22,466
You know, at these

476
00:23:23,196 --> 00:23:25,566
we could see some very

477
00:23:25,566 --> 00:23:27,016
in the way that Avaz was used.

478
00:23:27,596 --> 00:23:29,006
And let me talk to

479
00:23:29,006 --> 00:23:32,356
about how Avaz was being

480
00:23:34,756 --> 00:23:37,096
What Avaz did very

481
00:23:37,096 --> 00:23:40,346
to help kids have this

482
00:23:40,346 --> 00:23:43,116
So instead of having to speak

483
00:23:43,116 --> 00:23:45,436
to remember how they sounded,

484
00:23:45,436 --> 00:23:47,186
they could use pictures

485
00:23:47,186 --> 00:23:50,966
So, for example, if a kid wanted

486
00:23:50,966 --> 00:23:53,766
and they wanted something to

487
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:55,226
and find the word

488
00:23:56,216 --> 00:23:58,396
If they wanted to say that they

489
00:23:58,396 --> 00:24:00,236
for example, they

490
00:23:58,396 --> 00:24:00,236
for example, they

491
00:24:00,316 --> 00:24:01,326
and find the word "toilet".

492
00:24:01,846 --> 00:24:03,536
If they were eating something

493
00:24:03,536 --> 00:24:06,786
and they found the food

494
00:24:06,786 --> 00:24:08,686
into the app and they

495
00:24:08,686 --> 00:24:12,556
and they could say that.

496
00:24:12,556 --> 00:24:16,086
The problem happened when

497
00:24:16,236 --> 00:24:18,176
with more than one word.

498
00:24:19,296 --> 00:24:23,366
So, for example, if a kid

499
00:24:24,066 --> 00:24:26,676
it was quite common that

500
00:24:26,676 --> 00:24:28,796
"water" first and then they

501
00:24:30,196 --> 00:24:32,436
And they would do

502
00:24:32,436 --> 00:24:33,516
They would do it

503
00:24:33,516 --> 00:24:35,096
But they were doing

504
00:24:35,096 --> 00:24:35,866
as they were doing it right.

505
00:24:36,366 --> 00:24:38,666
Or, for example, if they wanted

506
00:24:39,126 --> 00:24:40,446
they would just pick

507
00:24:40,446 --> 00:24:41,526
and they would pick

508
00:24:41,846 --> 00:24:44,776
You know, they weren't really

509
00:24:44,776 --> 00:24:50,296
You see, Avaz was very

510
00:24:50,296 --> 00:24:55,726
down this symbolism of words

511
00:24:55,726 --> 00:24:56,836
of pictures into that.

512
00:24:57,646 --> 00:25:00,586
But this is actually a different

513
00:24:57,646 --> 00:25:00,586
But this is actually a different

514
00:25:00,586 --> 00:25:02,336
This is a symbolism of grammar.

515
00:25:03,146 --> 00:25:06,616
And grammar is something

516
00:25:06,616 --> 00:25:07,856

that they're even very hard

519

to explain and to understand.

520
00:25:15,886 --> 00:25:18,026
You know? For example, if

521
00:25:18,026 --> 00:25:20,996
"I want to eat,"

522
00:25:20,996 --> 00:25:22,816
of the word "to"

523
00:25:22,906 --> 00:25:25,686
You know, if you asked me,

524
00:25:25,726 --> 00:25:27,386
It's just a word that's there

525
00:25:27,386 --> 00:25:30,496
because it's ungrammatical

"He broke the window,"

529
00:25:39,396 --> 00:25:41,396
these two sentences are

530
00:25:41,636 --> 00:25:43,926
But the object that's

531
00:25:43,926 --> 00:25:45,746
Right? The window is the

532
00:25:45,746 --> 00:25:49,466
Why is it that it appears on one

00:25:49,466 --> 00:25:51,356
and on the other side of

534
00:25:51,966 --> 00:25:56,146
Or if you take this sentence,

535
00:25:56,146 --> 00:25:59,026
of this is obviously, "I ate."

536
00:25:59,156 --> 00:26:01,706

But if you negate this sentence,

why is it wrong to

00:27:29,026 --> 00:27:32,206
He has the unfortunate

568
00:27:32,206 --> 00:27:33,106
with a kind of sandwich.

569
00:27:33,106 --> 00:27:33,946
It's called Panini.

570
00:27:34,031 --> 00:27:36,031
[ Laughter ]

571
00:27:36,046 --> 00:27:41,906
But Panini lived in -- it didn't

572
00:27:42,031 --> 00:27:44,031
[ Laugther ]

573
00:27:44,046 --> 00:27:46,986
Panini lived around 500 BC.

574
00:27:47,216 --> 00:27:49,446
And Panini did something

575
00:27:49,516 --> 00:27:51,886
which is unprecedented

576
00:27:52,416 --> 00:27:55,736
He took a language, the

577
00:27:57,206 --> 00:28:03,396
and he created a concise,

578
00:27:57,206 --> 00:28:03,396
and he created a concise,

579
00:28:03,396 --> 00:28:08,756
of rules -- 4,000 rules -- that

580
00:28:10,626 --> 00:28:14,736
OK, so he had this set of 4,000

581
00:28:14,796 --> 00:28:16,286
of course still relevant today.

582
00:28:16,616 --> 00:28:20,586
But with these 4,000 rules, if

583
00:28:21,006 --> 00:28:23,496
any sentence that you

584
00:28:23,496 --> 00:28:25,066
to be grammatically-correct

585
00:28:26,346 --> 00:28:28,686
And conversely, any

586
00:28:28,686 --> 00:28:32,326
in Sanskrit, any sentence, any

587
00:28:32,326 --> 00:28:36,396
any grammatically-correct

588
00:28:36,766 --> 00:28:38,156
with these 4,000 rules.

589
00:28:38,646 --> 00:28:40,916
It was almost like he had

590
00:28:41,736 --> 00:28:42,986
to generate Sanskrit.

591
00:28:43,496 --> 00:28:48,626
So that codification of a

592
00:28:48,626 --> 00:28:50,156
that was absolutely beautiful.

593
00:28:50,156 --> 00:28:51,306
It was phenomenal.

594
00:28:51,566 --> 00:28:54,486
But that codification of

595
00:28:54,916 --> 00:28:56,566
that maybe this is an

596
00:28:56,566 --> 00:28:58,846
Maybe we can codify the

597
00:28:58,846 --> 00:29:01,306
into a computer in some

598
00:28:58,846 --> 00:29:01,306
into a computer in some

599
00:29:01,306 --> 00:29:04,816
that to give kids with

600
00:29:05,886 --> 00:29:08,186
But even though we

601
00:29:09,136 --> 00:29:11,796
the other missing component

602
00:29:11,796 --> 00:29:14,016
How could we get kids to

603
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:18,996
And the answer to that really

604
00:29:19,066 --> 00:29:22,716
in a school for kids with autism

605
00:29:22,796 --> 00:29:26,376
with -- I happened to

606
00:29:26,376 --> 00:29:29,136
where there was this little

607
00:29:29,136 --> 00:29:30,236
and there were her teachers.

608
00:29:30,926 --> 00:29:33,066
And this girl, you

609
00:29:33,066 --> 00:29:34,716
and she was almost

610
00:29:34,716 --> 00:29:35,986
But once in a while,

611
00:29:36,556 --> 00:29:37,836
And that's what happened

612
00:29:37,836 --> 00:29:41,246
She jumped up and she

613
00:29:41,956 --> 00:29:43,426
And there was no

614
00:29:43,806 --> 00:29:45,296
She just finished

615
00:29:45,426 --> 00:29:47,186
so her teacher thought

616
00:29:47,186 --> 00:29:48,276
to talk about her lunch.

617
00:29:48,756 --> 00:29:51,296
So they tried to get

618
00:29:51,296 --> 00:29:52,996
about her lunch on Avaz.

619
00:29:52,996 --> 00:29:54,996
But it was very clear

620
00:29:54,996 --> 00:29:56,266
that was not what she

621
00:29:57,206 --> 00:29:59,476
So we were all standing

622
00:29:59,476 --> 00:30:01,566
out what she meant

623
00:29:59,476 --> 00:30:01,566
out what she meant

624
00:30:01,636 --> 00:30:05,006
And then her mother started

625
00:30:06,396 --> 00:30:08,816
So her mother said,

626
00:30:09,296 --> 00:30:09,956
Eat lunch?

627
00:30:10,006 --> 00:30:10,656
Eat breakfast?

628
00:30:10,746 --> 00:30:11,496
Eat snacks?"

629
00:30:12,126 --> 00:30:14,936
And then the girl took out her

630
00:30:14,936 --> 00:30:16,416
and she pointed to

631
00:30:17,646 --> 00:30:19,596
And then her mother

632
00:30:19,736 --> 00:30:21,576
You eat? Someone else eats?"

633
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:24,506
You know? And then she

634
00:30:24,506 --> 00:30:27,356
And then her mother

635
00:30:27,356 --> 00:30:28,256
Eat now? Eat later?"

636
00:30:28,256 --> 00:30:31,106
And it turned out that

637
00:30:31,136 --> 00:30:33,616
to eat ice cream on her

638
00:30:34,636 --> 00:30:37,786
Now it's not often that

639
00:30:37,786 --> 00:30:39,376
when the lightbulb

640
00:30:39,656 --> 00:30:42,836
But in this particular case,

641
00:30:42,836 --> 00:30:43,756
like it happened yesterday.

642
00:30:44,706 --> 00:30:49,266
Because what struck me was

643
00:30:49,266 --> 00:30:53,416
that realization that this

644
00:30:53,416 --> 00:30:56,966
to communicate what she

645
00:30:58,616 --> 00:31:02,026
I mean, this girl could not put

646
00:30:58,616 --> 00:31:02,026
I mean, this girl could not put

647
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:04,366
She could not put multiple words

648
00:31:04,436 --> 00:31:06,436
She could not select

649
00:31:06,736 --> 00:31:08,386
She did not know what

650
00:31:08,926 --> 00:31:12,846
She did not know the way in

651
00:31:12,846 --> 00:31:16,426
It's almost as if her mother had

652
00:31:16,426 --> 00:31:21,936
out what the meaning was

653
00:31:21,936 --> 00:31:24,776
So this was the other

654
00:31:25,476 --> 00:31:27,386
You know, and I took this idea

655
00:31:27,386 --> 00:31:31,056
that we could really represent

656
00:31:31,516 --> 00:31:34,536
if we joined words together

657
00:31:34,736 --> 00:31:37,886
And I combined that with

658
00:31:37,886 --> 00:31:42,116
from my study of Panini and all

659
00:31:42,116 --> 00:31:43,946
and the resource in

660
00:31:43,946 --> 00:31:44,936
over the last few years.

661
00:31:45,646 --> 00:31:48,786
And I put that together

662
00:31:48,786 --> 00:31:51,296
It took me three years to

663
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:52,646
I started in 2012.

664
00:31:52,646 --> 00:31:55,256
It was in 2015 that the

665
00:31:55,356 --> 00:31:59,716
And in 2016, we put

666
00:31:59,806 --> 00:32:01,166
this year, just a

667
00:31:59,806 --> 00:32:01,166
this year, just a

668
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:03,486
It's called FreeSpeech.

669
00:32:04,076 --> 00:32:07,136
And let me show you a quick

670
00:32:07,136 --> 00:32:08,866
to you how we solved

671
00:32:20,206 --> 00:32:21,936
OK, so this is the

672
00:32:22,156 --> 00:32:25,146
And you can see that it

673
00:32:25,146 --> 00:32:26,346
that Avaz has pictures.

674
00:32:26,346 --> 00:32:29,146
In fact, if I tap on the

675
00:32:29,146 --> 00:32:32,956
on the bottom-left, it has all

676
00:32:33,746 --> 00:32:36,406
But unlike Avaz, when

677
00:32:36,406 --> 00:32:39,066
in FreeSpeech, you

678
00:32:39,066 --> 00:32:40,456
at the beginning

679
00:32:40,456 --> 00:32:42,356
In fact, you can start

680
00:32:42,356 --> 00:32:45,586
So, for example, supposing

681
00:32:46,746 --> 00:32:48,726
and I drop it here

682
00:32:49,176 --> 00:32:50,166
Here's the interesting part.

683
00:32:50,376 --> 00:32:50,886
&gt;&gt; Take

684
00:32:51,376 --> 00:32:55,626
&gt;&gt; The app actually gives you

685
00:32:56,106 --> 00:32:59,236
of questions around the word

686
00:33:00,086 --> 00:33:02,986
so that you can add more words

687
00:33:02,986 --> 00:33:05,666
It's very similar to what

688
00:33:05,666 --> 00:33:08,886
For example, if I drag

689
00:33:09,086 --> 00:33:11,706
and I put it into

690
00:33:12,186 --> 00:33:13,416
&gt;&gt; The teacher takes.

691
00:33:13,786 --> 00:33:15,856
&gt;&gt; It automatically

692
00:33:16,256 --> 00:33:17,706
with that specific meaning.

693
00:33:17,706 --> 00:33:18,806
It says, "The teacher takes."

694
00:33:19,306 --> 00:33:22,506
I can take the word "book", and

695
00:33:22,816 --> 00:33:25,496
it will say, "The

696
00:33:25,696 --> 00:33:29,186
And if I take the word "school"

697
00:33:29,286 --> 00:33:34,506
"to", it will say, "The teacher

698
00:33:35,286 --> 00:33:38,076
Let me show you a slightly

699
00:33:38,326 --> 00:33:41,306
So, supposing we pick the

700
00:33:41,306 --> 00:33:44,376
that in here, it pops up

701
00:33:45,386 --> 00:33:49,026
And I can take the word "parent"

702
00:33:49,026 --> 00:33:50,636
If I put into "want",

703
00:33:50,636 --> 00:33:52,326
it will say, "Want the parent."

704
00:33:52,506 --> 00:33:55,896
But if I took that from that

705
00:33:55,896 --> 00:33:58,526
into the "who", it will

706
00:33:58,526 --> 00:34:00,146
And you see that every

707
00:33:58,526 --> 00:34:00,146
And you see that every

708
00:34:00,236 --> 00:34:02,366
it actually gives you

709
00:34:02,366 --> 00:34:03,496
So more questions pop up.

710
00:34:03,496 --> 00:34:05,276
So you can see that

711
00:34:05,276 --> 00:34:07,346
which is next to "parent".

712
00:34:07,346 --> 00:34:09,766
So if I tap that, it will

713
00:34:09,766 --> 00:34:10,666
"Whose parent wants?"

714
00:34:10,666 --> 00:34:13,116
And then I can drag the

715
00:34:13,116 --> 00:34:14,485
and drop that in here.

716
00:34:14,485 --> 00:34:16,386
It will say, "Her parent wants."

717
00:34:16,835 --> 00:34:20,036
If I tap this little button on

718
00:34:20,036 --> 00:34:21,755
I can convert that

719
00:34:21,755 --> 00:34:24,206
So I can make it,

720
00:34:24,815 --> 00:34:28,416
If I add the word "see",

721
00:34:28,416 --> 00:34:30,866
"Her parents want to see."

722
00:34:30,866 --> 00:34:33,516
And I can drag the word

723
00:34:33,516 --> 00:34:35,216
"Her parents want to see you."

724
00:34:36,096 --> 00:34:38,005
In fact, I can do even more

725
00:34:38,146 --> 00:34:41,226
I can say that all of

726
00:34:41,485 --> 00:34:43,806
And I don't have to use the

727
00:34:43,866 --> 00:34:45,416
All I can do is I

728
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:46,356
at the bottom that says Past.

729
00:34:46,356 --> 00:34:50,636
It will say, "Her parents

730
00:34:51,045 --> 00:34:52,016
And I can negate that.

731
00:34:52,016 --> 00:34:54,576
So if I press the Not button

732
00:34:54,576 --> 00:34:57,166
"Her parents didn't

733
00:34:57,816 --> 00:34:59,176
I can make a question out of it.

734
00:34:59,176 --> 00:35:01,276
&gt;&gt; Didn't her parents

735
00:34:59,176 --> 00:35:01,276
&gt;&gt; Didn't her parents

736
00:35:01,276 --> 00:35:03,956
&gt;&gt; Or I can make even more

737
00:35:04,516 --> 00:35:06,586
[ Applause ]

738
00:35:07,086 --> 00:35:08,976
&gt;&gt; Why didn't her

739
00:35:09,516 --> 00:35:11,546
[ Applause ]

740
00:35:12,046 --> 00:35:12,346
Thank you.

741
00:35:13,616 --> 00:35:13,986
Thank you.

742
00:35:14,366 --> 00:35:15,616
So that's how FreeSpeech works.

743
00:35:15,616 --> 00:35:17,216
And FreeSpeech is pretty amazing

744
00:35:17,826 --> 00:35:20,056
because I think it's

745
00:35:20,056 --> 00:35:23,056
that someone has actually come

746
00:35:23,956 --> 00:35:25,176
That's what the app

747
00:35:25,176 --> 00:35:26,866
I mean, you have all of

748
00:35:26,866 --> 00:35:29,246
and the app is putting

749
00:35:29,976 --> 00:35:32,026
Now why is that important

750
00:35:32,426 --> 00:35:35,506
The best way to kind of explain

751
00:35:35,506 --> 00:35:36,656
to a different disability.

752
00:35:36,786 --> 00:35:39,126
I'm sure many of you here

753
00:35:39,506 --> 00:35:40,666
Some of you may have

754
00:35:40,666 --> 00:35:41,506
with it when you were kids.

755
00:35:42,086 --> 00:35:44,546
Kids with dyslexia have a lot

756
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:46,556
You know, English

757
00:35:46,616 --> 00:35:48,376
I have difficulty

758
00:35:49,116 --> 00:35:51,996
But if you give a kid

759
00:35:51,996 --> 00:35:54,086
and you ask them to type,

760
00:35:55,206 --> 00:35:57,336
magically their disability

761
00:35:57,706 --> 00:36:00,076
Why? Because of spell check.

762
00:35:57,706 --> 00:36:00,076
Why? Because of spell check.

763
00:36:00,226 --> 00:36:01,116
Because of autocorrect.

764
00:36:02,206 --> 00:36:05,056
So a kid with dyslexia who

765
00:36:05,056 --> 00:36:08,236
to communicate, is able to type

766
00:36:08,236 --> 00:36:09,516
though they have

767
00:36:09,516 --> 00:36:12,306
Avaz does exactly that for kids

768
00:36:12,306 --> 00:36:14,836
who have a language

769
00:36:15,676 --> 00:36:17,446
It plays to their strengths.

770
00:36:17,806 --> 00:36:20,456
They're able to take

771
00:36:20,456 --> 00:36:26,176
out pictures from the tablet,

772
00:36:26,176 --> 00:36:28,016
in different configurations.

773
00:36:28,706 --> 00:36:29,666
But every time they do that,

774
00:36:30,116 --> 00:36:33,746
the algorithm is automatically

775
00:36:33,746 --> 00:36:36,906
sentence and is speaking

776
00:36:37,976 --> 00:36:41,516
Now, we did trials for about

777
00:36:42,576 --> 00:36:43,926
FreeSpeech out on the market.

778
00:36:44,426 --> 00:36:46,256
And the results with kids

779
00:36:46,256 --> 00:36:48,306
with autism were dramatic

780
00:36:48,416 --> 00:36:50,856
There were kids who were

781
00:36:50,856 --> 00:36:52,306
or they were communicating

782
00:36:52,786 --> 00:36:54,246
And suddenly, in minutes --

783
00:36:54,296 --> 00:36:56,346
literally minutes after they

784
00:36:56,396 --> 00:36:58,766
they were constructing these

785
00:36:58,836 --> 00:37:01,566
In fact, there was this

786
00:36:58,836 --> 00:37:01,566
In fact, there was this

787
00:37:01,566 --> 00:37:03,116
I want to show you

788
00:37:03,726 --> 00:37:08,576
This kid was in -- you know,

789
00:37:08,576 --> 00:37:09,806
single words to communicate.

790
00:37:10,156 --> 00:37:15,736
And you can see that he's not

791
00:37:15,826 --> 00:37:16,986
fluently, but he's actually --

792
00:37:17,836 --> 00:37:20,156
FreeSpeech is teaching

793
00:37:20,686 --> 00:37:22,496

[ Applause ]

818
00:38:29,206 --> 00:38:32,226
&gt;&gt; This is pretty incredible.

819
00:38:32,226 --> 00:38:33,266
You know, this kid was in --

820
00:38:34,106 --> 00:38:36,026
this is a kid in

he was completely

In fact, his therapist

824
00:38:45,236 --> 00:38:47,816
You know, before Lucas

825
00:38:47,816 --> 00:38:48,616
he was a linguist.

826
00:38:49,236 --> 00:38:50,836
And so he sent this video to us.

827
00:38:51,526 --> 00:38:53,976
And to say he was blown

828
00:38:53,976 --> 00:38:56,526
because the same day that I

829
00:38:56,526 --> 00:38:59,486
from Lucas asking me if he could

830
00:39:00,031 --> 00:39:02,031
[ Laughter ]

831
00:39:02,046 --> 00:39:04,286
And that's how Lucas

832
00:39:04,286 --> 00:39:05,726
in speech therapy in autism.

833
00:39:06,236 --> 00:39:13,116
In fact, when we put

834
00:39:13,376 --> 00:39:15,206
Lucas also had a

835
00:39:16,076 --> 00:39:18,226
because Lucas had this

836
00:39:18,456 --> 00:39:21,346
And this other kid had a --

837
00:39:21,346 --> 00:39:23,436
but he was facing a very

838
00:39:24,296 --> 00:39:25,796
This other kid that was

839
00:39:25,796 --> 00:39:28,836
on Lucas' caseload,

840
00:39:29,026 --> 00:39:31,796
He came from a bilingual

841
00:39:31,986 --> 00:39:33,416
bilingual, English and Spanish.

842
00:39:34,136 --> 00:39:36,846
So, at school, he would

843
00:39:36,906 --> 00:39:38,456
All of his teachers would

844
00:39:38,486 --> 00:39:42,916
But when he went back home, his

845
00:39:42,916 --> 00:39:44,896
and all of his neighbors, they

846
00:39:46,376 --> 00:39:50,156
Now this is a challenge that

847
00:39:50,156 --> 00:39:52,096
with for many, many years.

848
00:39:52,246 --> 00:39:55,486
You know, devices like Avaz,

849
00:39:55,486 --> 00:39:56,906
They do exist in

850
00:39:57,616 --> 00:40:00,806
But the problem of how do

851
00:39:57,616 --> 00:40:00,806
But the problem of how do

852
00:40:00,806 --> 00:40:03,516
who speaks two different

853
00:40:03,516 --> 00:40:06,026
challenge for kids with autism

854
00:40:06,026 --> 00:40:08,136
and for the therapists

855
00:40:08,686 --> 00:40:12,166
So, let me give you a short demo

856
00:40:12,166 --> 00:40:15,616
Let me go back into

857
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:19,606
to you what the issue is.

858
00:40:19,606 --> 00:40:20,586
So, this is Avaz, right?

859
00:40:20,586 --> 00:40:22,336
So we looked at the

860
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:24,136
to create a very quick sentence.

861
00:40:24,136 --> 00:40:28,656
I'm going to say, "I want

862
00:40:28,656 --> 00:40:29,916
And let's say, "I

863
00:40:30,026 --> 00:40:33,676
Right? So I pick out these

864
00:40:34,026 --> 00:40:36,656
And so let's say that a kid

865
00:40:36,656 --> 00:40:38,476
"I want to go home,"

866
00:40:38,696 --> 00:40:42,976
Now there is a Spanish

867
00:40:42,976 --> 00:40:45,666
so let me switch into

868
00:40:46,346 --> 00:40:49,096
So -- yeah.

869
00:40:49,846 --> 00:40:52,786
How many Spanish

870
00:40:53,526 --> 00:40:55,816
OK. I don't know Spanish at all.

871
00:40:55,816 --> 00:40:56,906
I know zero Spanish.

872
00:40:57,136 --> 00:41:01,176
But, you know, I'm going

873
00:40:57,136 --> 00:41:01,176
But, you know, I'm going

874
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:04,656
to create a Spanish sentence

875
00:41:05,036 --> 00:41:06,036
So, let's see.

876
00:41:06,036 --> 00:41:07,596
So I have the picture

877
00:41:07,976 --> 00:41:09,056
I can recognize that.

878
00:41:09,056 --> 00:41:09,516
That's here.

879
00:41:09,516 --> 00:41:11,796
And then I have "want".

880
00:41:12,246 --> 00:41:15,606
And this looks like the

881
00:41:16,356 --> 00:41:17,746
And this is "go".

882
00:41:18,496 --> 00:41:21,166
And so there's places in here.

883
00:41:21,166 --> 00:41:24,646
And this is "home".

884
00:41:26,116 --> 00:41:29,916
Is that the right

885
00:41:29,916 --> 00:41:34,416
If I went to Mexico and if I

886
00:41:34,416 --> 00:41:37,106
at me because this is

887
00:41:38,406 --> 00:41:40,616
You see, I've actually

888
00:41:40,616 --> 00:41:42,746
of picking the right

889
00:41:42,746 --> 00:41:44,626
the words "I", "want", "go".

890
00:41:44,626 --> 00:41:45,506
All of these are correct.

891
00:41:46,176 --> 00:41:49,646
But in Spanish, the way that the

892
00:41:49,646 --> 00:41:54,126
For example, the word "querer"

893
00:41:54,606 --> 00:41:57,006
you actually have to inflect

894
00:41:57,546 --> 00:41:59,806
when you use it for

895
00:42:00,456 --> 00:42:02,196
And similarly, you

896
00:42:02,456 --> 00:42:04,736
in Spanish the same way that

897
00:42:04,736 --> 00:42:06,416
You'd actually put that

898
00:42:06,476 --> 00:42:09,046
"casa" to say "tu home".

899
00:42:09,566 --> 00:42:12,736
So the problem here is

900
00:42:12,736 --> 00:42:14,176
between two different languages,

901
00:42:14,176 --> 00:42:15,886
the interface actually

902
00:42:15,886 --> 00:42:16,856
And you can see that, right?

903
00:42:17,006 --> 00:42:18,926
The Avaz interface

904
00:42:18,926 --> 00:42:20,186
between the two languages.

905
00:42:21,126 --> 00:42:24,106
But the user experience is

906
00:42:24,196 --> 00:42:26,626
because kids have to learn

907
00:42:26,626 --> 00:42:28,326
to be able to construct

908
00:42:28,326 --> 00:42:29,586
and to be able to

909
00:42:30,386 --> 00:42:35,336
So this was a problem that

910
00:42:35,336 --> 00:42:37,486
but really everyone

911
00:42:37,486 --> 00:42:38,486
with kids with disabilities.

912
00:42:38,796 --> 00:42:42,846
Essentially, the child had to

913
00:42:43,126 --> 00:42:46,016
of using the same app for them

914
00:42:47,206 --> 00:42:49,326
So the idea that kind of

915
00:42:49,326 --> 00:42:51,556
"Can we use FreeSpeech

916
00:42:52,226 --> 00:42:54,266
FreeSpeech is essentially,

917
00:42:54,346 --> 00:42:56,376
a representation of meaning.

918
00:42:56,376 --> 00:42:58,176
Right? So the way that you

919
00:42:58,176 --> 00:42:59,816
the way that you

920
00:43:00,306 --> 00:43:02,436
they're essentially

921
00:43:02,436 --> 00:43:03,526
that you're trying to say.

922
00:43:03,686 --> 00:43:05,376
And the app is putting

923
00:43:05,376 --> 00:43:09,416
So can we use that to be able to

924
00:43:09,416 --> 00:43:12,086
you know, even if they

925
00:43:12,086 --> 00:43:13,416
So I'm going to go

926
00:43:13,416 --> 00:43:14,976
and there's a Spanish

927
00:43:15,756 --> 00:43:17,976
And you can see that,

928
00:43:17,976 --> 00:43:20,126
the interface completely

929
00:43:21,596 --> 00:43:23,756
And all the words

930
00:43:24,356 --> 00:43:26,366
The labels are in

931
00:43:26,506 --> 00:43:28,996
And when I drag a word

932
00:43:28,996 --> 00:43:32,486
all of the interface elements

933
00:43:32,846 --> 00:43:36,056
The questions are in Spanish,

934
00:43:36,586 --> 00:43:37,606
But here's the interesting part.

935
00:43:37,946 --> 00:43:39,796
When I start putting words in,

936
00:43:40,456 --> 00:43:41,116
&gt;&gt; I want.

937
00:43:41,686 --> 00:43:44,586
&gt;&gt; It actually gives me an

938
00:43:45,096 --> 00:43:49,866
So I can say -- so if I want to

939
00:43:50,146 --> 00:43:52,016
