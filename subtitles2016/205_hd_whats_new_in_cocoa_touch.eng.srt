00:00:24,596 --> 00:00:25,016
&gt;&gt; Welcome.

5
00:00:28,136 --> 00:00:31,226
My name is Olivier Gutknecht

6
00:00:31,846 --> 00:00:35,416
and today we're going to talk

7
00:00:36,206 --> 00:00:39,166
and other system

8
00:00:40,696 --> 00:00:44,136
But first, I'd like

9
00:00:44,976 --> 00:00:48,456
what is not new, in Cocoa Touch.

10
00:00:49,786 --> 00:00:55,276
Why, since last WWDC,

11
00:00:55,276 --> 00:00:56,666
of very important products.

12
00:00:58,026 --> 00:01:01,506
The iPhone 6S with 3D Touch.

13
00:00:58,026 --> 00:01:01,506
The iPhone 6S with 3D Touch.

14
00:01:01,846 --> 00:01:07,706
The iPad Pro 12.9

15
00:01:08,056 --> 00:01:11,616
The Apple Pencil, and

16
00:01:12,726 --> 00:01:16,476
And, with these products

17
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:19,096
of key technologies

18
00:01:19,686 --> 00:01:21,616
to make your applications

19
00:01:22,856 --> 00:01:25,856
The first thing that I want

20
00:01:26,636 --> 00:01:31,836
When we introduced adaptivity

21
00:01:31,836 --> 00:01:35,306
that we introduced was the

22
00:01:36,306 --> 00:01:39,956
The iPhone was a

23
00:01:41,086 --> 00:01:43,426
The iPad is regular.

24
00:01:43,956 --> 00:01:47,506
And now we have the

25
00:01:48,676 --> 00:01:50,726
do we need gigantic size class?

26
00:01:52,296 --> 00:01:57,136
We don't. Because now

27
00:01:57,776 --> 00:02:00,146
in the framework

28
00:01:57,776 --> 00:02:00,146
in the framework

29
00:02:01,356 --> 00:02:02,816
We have the trait system

30
00:02:03,066 --> 00:02:06,526
which is how your application

31
00:02:06,686 --> 00:02:09,106
and environment of

32
00:02:09,476 --> 00:02:13,166
Size classes, that's one very

33
00:02:13,786 --> 00:02:15,286
you have everything

34
00:02:15,286 --> 00:02:18,566
to build a size based

35
00:02:20,186 --> 00:02:22,926
We added new support

36
00:02:23,826 --> 00:02:27,896
in Interface Builder and,

37
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:32,546
from auto layout to asset

38
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:35,536
with layout guide, and

39
00:02:36,076 --> 00:02:38,346
everything is ready

40
00:02:39,746 --> 00:02:42,146
We're going to have also,

41
00:02:42,506 --> 00:02:45,816
two sessions this week

42
00:02:46,086 --> 00:02:50,196
The first one's going to focus

43
00:02:50,806 --> 00:02:54,096
And the second one,

44
00:02:54,096 --> 00:02:55,526
and the techniques you can use

45
00:02:55,826 --> 00:02:57,476
to make your application

46
00:02:58,276 --> 00:03:01,086
And this morning there was

47
00:02:58,276 --> 00:03:01,086
And this morning there was

48
00:03:01,086 --> 00:03:03,256
on design, you should watch.

49
00:03:04,156 --> 00:03:08,766
The second thing that I'd like

50
00:03:10,076 --> 00:03:15,056
Last year, with the iPad

51
00:03:15,706 --> 00:03:18,416
we have 120 Hz touch scanning.

52
00:03:18,796 --> 00:03:22,656
We are scanning faster than

53
00:03:23,516 --> 00:03:27,216
And now, with Apple Pencil

54
00:03:27,566 --> 00:03:31,206
on touches so you can get

55
00:03:31,636 --> 00:03:32,306
force.

56
00:03:33,576 --> 00:03:37,466
With iPhone 6S, you have

57
00:03:37,466 --> 00:03:43,486
with 3D Touch and we shift

58
00:03:43,486 --> 00:03:49,316
The APIs you need to build

59
00:03:49,706 --> 00:03:51,316
And Dominique Wagner is going

60
00:03:51,316 --> 00:03:54,726
to present how you can

61
00:03:58,116 --> 00:04:02,806
The last thing that I'd like to

62
00:03:58,116 --> 00:04:02,806
The last thing that I'd like to

63
00:04:03,786 --> 00:04:08,176
We have an API for you, so you

64
00:04:08,176 --> 00:04:12,316
in your apps, I think you have

65
00:04:12,316 --> 00:04:14,256
with your application

66
00:04:14,986 --> 00:04:19,096
So you can have dynamic

67
00:04:19,946 --> 00:04:22,036
The API for that is reasonable.

68
00:04:23,186 --> 00:04:26,096
It's actually, an API

69
00:04:27,186 --> 00:04:29,846
And it's important now

70
00:04:30,396 --> 00:04:34,046
we can display these

71
00:04:34,326 --> 00:04:38,736
when you hold the command key.

72
00:04:38,986 --> 00:04:43,446
Now, let's talk about what

73
00:04:44,066 --> 00:04:46,686
I'd like to cover

74
00:04:47,656 --> 00:04:52,496
One, the core technologies

75
00:04:52,496 --> 00:04:53,536
in your applications.

76
00:04:54,386 --> 00:04:59,886
And, we're going to discuss

77
00:05:00,286 --> 00:05:03,506
you can build better UIs

78
00:05:03,956 --> 00:05:07,396
We're going to show how

79
00:05:07,436 --> 00:05:10,216
in iOS 10 can make your

80
00:05:11,566 --> 00:05:13,876
And, we're going

81
00:05:14,076 --> 00:05:17,826
how your application

82
00:05:18,016 --> 00:05:19,446
with all new extension points.

83
00:05:21,586 --> 00:05:23,766
So let's talk about

84
00:05:25,256 --> 00:05:29,356
Swift 3 is probably

85
00:05:30,006 --> 00:05:36,296
Because with Swift 3, every

86
00:05:36,926 --> 00:05:40,216
Because we change the rules,

87
00:05:40,846 --> 00:05:43,926
from Objective-C to Swift.

88
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:47,846
And we are doing that,

89
00:05:48,386 --> 00:05:52,466
so it can feel native really,

90
00:05:52,806 --> 00:05:55,526
So for instance, something

91
00:05:56,136 --> 00:05:58,416
we are now using

92
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:00,736
to make the intent clear.

93
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:00,736
to make the intent clear.

94
00:06:02,436 --> 00:06:05,456
We also try to not repeat

95
00:06:05,456 --> 00:06:08,436
black color now is

96
00:06:10,476 --> 00:06:15,946
One thing that I really like

97
00:06:15,946 --> 00:06:20,416
and core graphics

98
00:06:20,816 --> 00:06:22,856
when writing UIKit application.

99
00:06:23,906 --> 00:06:27,476
And, even something like,

100
00:06:28,796 --> 00:06:32,296
is now a full object API.

101
00:06:34,096 --> 00:06:36,556
Let's talk about grand

102
00:06:37,206 --> 00:06:42,956
There is a feature that I really

103
00:06:42,956 --> 00:06:45,906
with the dispatch is the

104
00:06:46,966 --> 00:06:53,046
And when queue work item to be

105
00:06:53,786 --> 00:06:58,346
a new thing in iOS 10, is you

106
00:06:58,836 --> 00:07:04,046
to automatically wrap every work

107
00:06:58,836 --> 00:07:04,046
to automatically wrap every work

108
00:07:04,876 --> 00:07:07,926
It's real easy to do, you

109
00:07:08,556 --> 00:07:11,946
and you pass the

110
00:07:12,606 --> 00:07:18,336
We have a full session on GCD,

111
00:07:21,046 --> 00:07:24,236
Foundation, foundation

112
00:07:24,236 --> 00:07:28,976
of Swift enhancement, we dropped

113
00:07:29,356 --> 00:07:33,166
and we have a major new feature,

114
00:07:33,606 --> 00:07:34,296
to the foundation API.

115
00:07:34,296 --> 00:07:36,626
It's not just that.

116
00:07:36,996 --> 00:07:40,096
We also have full

117
00:07:40,526 --> 00:07:42,356
and measurements in foundation.

118
00:07:43,766 --> 00:07:48,996
Another thing is a new date

119
00:07:49,216 --> 00:07:51,176
If you know what AP 601 is,

120
00:07:51,176 --> 00:07:54,196
you're probably very

121
00:07:56,516 --> 00:07:59,546
[ Applause ]

122
00:08:00,046 --> 00:08:05,156
And another nice feature is how

123
00:08:05,156 --> 00:08:07,536
better with new NS

124
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:09,666
We have two sessions

125
00:08:10,436 --> 00:08:11,926
What's New in Foundation

126
00:08:12,396 --> 00:08:14,066
and Measurements and Units.

127
00:08:16,056 --> 00:08:20,946
Yesterday, we announced

128
00:08:21,636 --> 00:08:25,586
copy on your Mac and

129
00:08:26,356 --> 00:08:28,466
So how do you use that

130
00:08:29,276 --> 00:08:34,716
You just use the existing UI

131
00:08:34,716 --> 00:08:36,056
There is one thing

132
00:08:38,275 --> 00:08:43,405
You might have to fetch a very

133
00:08:43,405 --> 00:08:46,016
if I do a copy of

134
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:48,376
it might take a second or two.

135
00:08:48,376 --> 00:08:49,636
So you might see this UI.

136
00:08:50,426 --> 00:08:55,106
So to avoid, problem when

137
00:08:55,296 --> 00:08:58,436
you should check first, if

138
00:08:58,436 --> 00:08:59,866
So you can avoid this UI.

139
00:08:59,866 --> 00:09:04,056
We added four new methods

140
00:08:59,866 --> 00:09:04,056
We added four new methods

141
00:09:04,376 --> 00:09:09,176
so you can easily check for

142
00:09:11,616 --> 00:09:15,436
Another thing in

143
00:09:15,436 --> 00:09:19,326
that you can now control what

144
00:09:19,856 --> 00:09:25,366
So now you can restrict your

145
00:09:25,986 --> 00:09:27,986
or set an expiration date.

146
00:09:29,516 --> 00:09:35,656
[ Applause ]

147
00:09:36,156 --> 00:09:38,726
Now I'd like to talk

148
00:09:40,736 --> 00:09:44,686
It's not a software feature,

149
00:09:44,686 --> 00:09:52,516
that we have now in the new iMac

150
00:09:53,906 --> 00:09:57,436
It's a technology shift, you can

151
00:09:58,316 --> 00:10:00,856
that was not physically

152
00:09:58,316 --> 00:10:00,856
that was not physically

153
00:10:01,596 --> 00:10:06,786
And, we are changing how we

154
00:10:07,886 --> 00:10:11,346
The iOS devices were using

155
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:13,706
Now with this device,

156
00:10:13,706 --> 00:10:16,326
in that extended

157
00:10:16,806 --> 00:10:17,936
So what does that mean for you?

158
00:10:18,946 --> 00:10:25,046
So first, iOS is actually

159
00:10:25,046 --> 00:10:30,466
iOS and [inaudible] and in iOS

160
00:10:30,466 --> 00:10:32,676
to work with a wide color range.

161
00:10:34,716 --> 00:10:37,486
The first way is to

162
00:10:38,426 --> 00:10:41,086
UI Image View is actually

163
00:10:41,256 --> 00:10:43,796
since iOS 9.3, so

164
00:10:44,866 --> 00:10:46,416
What about UI Color?

165
00:10:47,876 --> 00:10:49,796
We made that very simple.

166
00:10:50,766 --> 00:10:55,376
We have one existing

167
00:10:56,786 --> 00:11:02,096
Second one, and new one,

168
00:10:56,786 --> 00:11:02,096
Second one, and new one,

169
00:11:03,136 --> 00:11:08,016
The first one is how you can

170
00:11:08,266 --> 00:11:10,606
in the extended sRGB space.

171
00:11:11,386 --> 00:11:15,016
So now you can express a

172
00:11:15,016 --> 00:11:18,796
to 1 range, if you want

173
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:22,046
The second one displayP3,

174
00:11:22,536 --> 00:11:24,536
displayP3 is actually

175
00:11:24,536 --> 00:11:26,876
that is quite common

176
00:11:26,876 --> 00:11:30,366
So if you receive a spec with

177
00:11:30,366 --> 00:11:32,486
that you're going

178
00:11:32,486 --> 00:11:36,306
which is why we made that,

179
00:11:36,566 --> 00:11:37,106
And that's it.

180
00:11:38,006 --> 00:11:39,886
We don't have a color

181
00:11:40,546 --> 00:11:47,146
You can just use these two

182
00:11:48,096 --> 00:11:51,586
Now, I'd like to talk

183
00:11:53,816 --> 00:11:57,676
Image rendering is something

184
00:11:57,676 --> 00:12:00,606
that you're probably

185
00:11:57,676 --> 00:12:00,606
that you're probably

186
00:12:01,076 --> 00:12:03,646
with the UI graphics

187
00:12:04,086 --> 00:12:05,456
add image from text APIs.

188
00:12:05,456 --> 00:12:10,786
Kind of thing that you do in

189
00:12:10,786 --> 00:12:12,466
render an image off screen.

190
00:12:13,056 --> 00:12:14,996
So there is one problem

191
00:12:16,256 --> 00:12:21,496
It's actually 32 bits sRGB only,

192
00:12:22,226 --> 00:12:27,816
Also, that's not our best API,

193
00:12:28,336 --> 00:12:30,616
and it's not really extensible.

194
00:12:30,616 --> 00:12:34,366
So, something that you're

195
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:37,246
begin image context, API,

196
00:12:38,106 --> 00:12:40,786
And I don't know how many of

197
00:12:40,786 --> 00:12:44,056
of trying to get the image

198
00:12:44,626 --> 00:12:46,336
I'm definitely one.

199
00:12:46,696 --> 00:12:49,426
But now, we have a new class,

200
00:12:50,876 --> 00:12:52,756
the new UI graphics

201
00:12:52,756 --> 00:12:58,646
And what this is giving you is,

202
00:12:59,686 --> 00:13:01,536
It's going to do the

203
00:12:59,686 --> 00:13:01,536
It's going to do the

204
00:13:02,516 --> 00:13:06,986
If you're on a 9.7

205
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:08,966
to get a wide color context.

206
00:13:09,446 --> 00:13:12,056
If you're not, you will

207
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:16,476
The other thing, it's

208
00:13:17,066 --> 00:13:19,666
And, it's an object

209
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:24,796
to increase our classes

210
00:13:25,366 --> 00:13:27,876
Also, and that's

211
00:13:28,756 --> 00:13:33,076
that class will manage the

212
00:13:33,676 --> 00:13:36,276
Which means that we can do

213
00:13:36,576 --> 00:13:37,146
under the hood.

214
00:13:37,476 --> 00:13:39,436
Let me give you an example.

215
00:13:40,316 --> 00:13:44,586
For that the equivalent

216
00:13:45,146 --> 00:13:46,486
you just create your renderer.

217
00:13:48,056 --> 00:13:51,256
You try to generate an

218
00:13:51,256 --> 00:13:54,216
of passing the block, and

219
00:13:54,606 --> 00:13:57,016
And the thing that's

220
00:13:57,626 --> 00:14:01,876
if you call again, the

221
00:13:57,626 --> 00:14:01,876
if you call again, the

222
00:14:01,876 --> 00:14:04,686
to just be used the

223
00:14:09,236 --> 00:14:17,546
A new feature related to

224
00:14:18,626 --> 00:14:23,466
With asset catalogs, we have

225
00:14:24,366 --> 00:14:28,536
right to left and left to

226
00:14:29,026 --> 00:14:31,116
And of course they're

227
00:14:31,386 --> 00:14:33,686
with the trait system in UIKit.

228
00:14:34,786 --> 00:14:37,016
So, let's see the first one.

229
00:14:38,066 --> 00:14:38,936
What color asset?

230
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:40,546
So what do we want to do here?

231
00:14:41,406 --> 00:14:44,866
If you're embedding,

232
00:14:45,566 --> 00:14:48,696
in your application, you

233
00:14:48,796 --> 00:14:51,116
on a non-wide color device.

234
00:14:51,876 --> 00:14:56,286
So what we are going to do is,

235
00:14:56,326 --> 00:14:59,186
of sRGB variant automatically

236
00:14:59,976 --> 00:15:02,856
And that's going to be fully

237
00:14:59,976 --> 00:15:02,856
And that's going to be fully

238
00:15:03,076 --> 00:15:05,626
so we're going to deploy

239
00:15:06,306 --> 00:15:11,646
on the right device.

240
00:15:12,046 --> 00:15:15,366
The other new feature in

241
00:15:17,036 --> 00:15:20,096
We added support for a

242
00:15:20,796 --> 00:15:26,466
And, it's going to automatically

243
00:15:27,056 --> 00:15:30,996
it's going to automatically

244
00:15:30,996 --> 00:15:32,056
for a given device.

245
00:15:32,266 --> 00:15:37,416
So you will a great balance

246
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:41,526
And again, that's completely

247
00:15:41,526 --> 00:15:45,056
so we only deploy what is

248
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:50,746
The last feature I

249
00:15:50,746 --> 00:15:53,296
for asset catalog

250
00:15:53,296 --> 00:15:54,676
or image asset support.

251
00:15:56,286 --> 00:16:00,486
It means that now, directly

252
00:15:56,286 --> 00:16:00,486
It means that now, directly

253
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:05,056
you can specify that an

254
00:16:06,136 --> 00:16:08,786
or a left to right asset.

255
00:16:09,456 --> 00:16:11,416
Or something that should

256
00:16:12,396 --> 00:16:14,206
directly in the asset

257
00:16:14,926 --> 00:16:19,606
We also have a full session on

258
00:16:20,296 --> 00:16:26,626
where you can learn more about

259
00:16:26,776 --> 00:16:28,546
Now, I'd like to switch

260
00:16:28,546 --> 00:16:32,866
to how you can build

261
00:16:33,216 --> 00:16:35,636
and interactions in iOS 10.

262
00:16:37,176 --> 00:16:40,086
And the first thing is,

263
00:16:41,176 --> 00:16:44,836
that everybody can interact

264
00:16:45,656 --> 00:16:48,146
We have the new accessibility

265
00:16:48,146 --> 00:16:51,856
and one thing you can do with

266
00:16:51,856 --> 00:16:54,936
you can connect to an

267
00:16:55,206 --> 00:16:58,156
immediately know the

268
00:16:58,826 --> 00:17:00,056
of a given UI element.

269
00:16:58,826 --> 00:17:00,056
of a given UI element.

270
00:17:01,826 --> 00:17:03,426
There is another

271
00:17:07,695 --> 00:17:12,346
You can also run an audit

272
00:17:12,806 --> 00:17:14,276
in the simulator or your device.

273
00:17:14,576 --> 00:17:18,425
Just so you can have a

274
00:17:18,425 --> 00:17:22,226
of problems you might want to

275
00:17:22,226 --> 00:17:24,006
to fix, with your application.

276
00:17:26,326 --> 00:17:32,086
One thing though, it's just like

277
00:17:32,336 --> 00:17:34,076
that doesn't mean that

278
00:17:34,076 --> 00:17:35,016
absolutely perfect.

279
00:17:35,716 --> 00:17:37,666
But, that's a great first step.

280
00:17:38,956 --> 00:17:41,366
We also have a new

281
00:17:41,976 --> 00:17:45,116
with your applications

282
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:50,246
We added a new gesture,

283
00:17:52,016 --> 00:17:56,546
[ Foreign Language ]

284
00:17:57,046 --> 00:17:58,226
And not just for English.

285
00:17:59,136 --> 00:18:01,226
And it's a very simple API.

286
00:17:59,136 --> 00:18:01,226
And it's a very simple API.

287
00:18:02,626 --> 00:18:05,846
The SFSpeech recognizer,

288
00:18:05,846 --> 00:18:08,756
that can do continuous

289
00:18:09,676 --> 00:18:13,276
And, you can connect

290
00:18:14,206 --> 00:18:16,146
or a live audio stream.

291
00:18:16,556 --> 00:18:22,936
So you can do real time,

292
00:18:23,036 --> 00:18:27,666
You can configure it to have a

293
00:18:27,986 --> 00:18:31,256
for dictation, or for

294
00:18:32,336 --> 00:18:35,186
Just want to give you

295
00:18:35,996 --> 00:18:39,876
You create a recognizer, you

296
00:18:40,656 --> 00:18:42,896
you start a task,

297
00:18:42,896 --> 00:18:45,366
to call you back with results.

298
00:18:46,266 --> 00:18:47,356
Really easy to use.

299
00:18:47,896 --> 00:18:55,376
We have a video in line in

300
00:18:55,616 --> 00:19:01,136
Another great improvement

301
00:18:55,616 --> 00:19:01,136
Another great improvement

302
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:06,556
One thing you can do now is to

303
00:19:06,556 --> 00:19:10,136
of content you have

304
00:19:10,966 --> 00:19:15,636
So, with that we can provide

305
00:19:16,066 --> 00:19:16,776
in quick type.

306
00:19:17,066 --> 00:19:20,366
So for instance if my text

307
00:19:20,986 --> 00:19:23,636
I'm going to see an

308
00:19:25,266 --> 00:19:30,726
We have many predefined

309
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:36,606
you can specify first name, last

310
00:19:36,786 --> 00:19:38,976
and in that case

311
00:19:38,976 --> 00:19:41,816
as a full street address.

312
00:19:43,326 --> 00:19:47,236
Or even things like email,

313
00:19:50,276 --> 00:19:52,786
Another thing about text input

314
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:57,266
and text is how you

315
00:19:58,696 --> 00:20:03,636
In iOS 7 we added support for

316
00:19:58,696 --> 00:20:03,636
In iOS 7 we added support for

317
00:20:03,886 --> 00:20:06,996
we are making the

318
00:20:06,996 --> 00:20:08,726
for dynamic type, a trait.

319
00:20:09,866 --> 00:20:10,676
So what does that mean?

320
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:16,636
Before iOS 10 the content size

321
00:20:16,846 --> 00:20:17,806
on UI application.

322
00:20:19,406 --> 00:20:23,136
And, you actually sent

323
00:20:23,996 --> 00:20:27,066
If the user was changing,

324
00:20:27,066 --> 00:20:33,156
you had to react this

325
00:20:33,346 --> 00:20:38,096
Now, because it's integrated

326
00:20:38,546 --> 00:20:40,476
on view controllers which mean

327
00:20:40,476 --> 00:20:44,866
that you can use dynamic

328
00:20:47,216 --> 00:20:51,346
And we actually also added

329
00:20:51,796 --> 00:20:54,516
in existing elements

330
00:20:54,956 --> 00:21:00,716
So if you build your UI with

331
00:20:54,956 --> 00:21:00,716
So if you build your UI with

332
00:21:01,566 --> 00:21:06,206
and you want to react,

333
00:21:07,626 --> 00:21:10,906
now in iOS 10 you can

334
00:21:11,566 --> 00:21:16,326
for content size category

335
00:21:16,486 --> 00:21:19,126
text field going to

336
00:21:19,926 --> 00:21:23,246
And your application, if you're

337
00:21:23,636 --> 00:21:25,156
will update automatically.

338
00:21:25,646 --> 00:21:29,396
So I think that's a really

339
00:21:29,396 --> 00:21:33,196
full automatic support, for

340
00:21:34,516 --> 00:21:39,666
[ Applause ]

341
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:45,136
We also wanted to add new

342
00:21:45,456 --> 00:21:48,256
A good example is

343
00:21:48,776 --> 00:21:52,566
now you can customize the batch

344
00:21:52,566 --> 00:21:57,096
in tab bar items, and you can

345
00:21:57,556 --> 00:21:58,036
theme color.

346
00:21:58,706 --> 00:22:01,286
So let's say that I

347
00:21:58,706 --> 00:22:01,286
So let's say that I

348
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:02,816
that is going to look like that.

349
00:22:03,566 --> 00:22:11,856
If I add this code, to my

350
00:22:11,856 --> 00:22:13,396
to be my new tab bar UI.

351
00:22:14,306 --> 00:22:16,836
Which is probably also

352
00:22:17,516 --> 00:22:24,806
[ Applause ]

353
00:22:25,306 --> 00:22:27,766
Another great customization,

354
00:22:28,986 --> 00:22:33,636
When we ship Peek and

355
00:22:34,646 --> 00:22:37,906
we had a very simple API in

356
00:22:38,266 --> 00:22:41,466
And we had built in

357
00:22:42,316 --> 00:22:46,816
And now in iOS 10, you

358
00:22:46,816 --> 00:22:49,346
and Pop behaviors

359
00:22:49,346 --> 00:22:53,816
which means that you can

360
00:22:54,176 --> 00:22:55,076
when doing a Peek.

361
00:22:55,696 --> 00:23:00,386
And you can have preview

362
00:22:55,696 --> 00:23:00,386
And you can have preview

363
00:23:00,386 --> 00:23:04,226
of that is, when you Pop in

364
00:23:04,226 --> 00:23:06,556
to stay inside your application.

365
00:23:07,276 --> 00:23:13,036
It's available as new delegate

366
00:23:14,416 --> 00:23:17,966
But, the thing that I'm really

367
00:23:18,436 --> 00:23:22,146
is the new UI preview

368
00:23:22,586 --> 00:23:27,486
So, Peek and Pop in UIKit,

369
00:23:28,676 --> 00:23:33,646
There is a look, this blur

370
00:23:33,646 --> 00:23:35,626
when you want to

371
00:23:36,716 --> 00:23:40,706
And there is a feel, how

372
00:23:40,946 --> 00:23:44,476
how do we detect the intent

373
00:23:44,476 --> 00:23:46,466
a scroll, the beginning

374
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:50,866
With UI preview interaction,

375
00:23:51,246 --> 00:23:55,146
to use a UIKit provided

376
00:23:56,026 --> 00:23:58,436
but have your own

377
00:23:59,446 --> 00:24:04,566
And, that's just a new delegate

we have a full session

in scroll views that

So we already had support for

so it mean that now you

396
00:25:05,796 --> 00:25:06,756
in correction views.

397
00:25:08,886 --> 00:25:11,106
Let's talk about

398
00:25:12,256 --> 00:25:14,236
That's a great feature in UIKit.

399
00:25:15,316 --> 00:25:18,676
And last year we added support

400
00:25:18,676 --> 00:25:23,126
for automatic self-sizing

401
00:25:24,246 --> 00:25:25,696
What you had to do before is,

402
00:25:25,696 --> 00:25:28,926
you had to compute

403
00:25:29,936 --> 00:25:32,206
And sometimes it's not easy but,

404
00:25:32,316 --> 00:25:35,986
at the UIKit level we know

405
00:25:36,406 --> 00:25:38,806
So we have a new

406
00:25:38,806 --> 00:25:42,086
so you can pass automatic

407
00:25:42,086 --> 00:25:44,726
that estimation for you,

408
00:25:44,726 --> 00:25:46,476
that estimation anymore.

Do you know that we

411
00:25:55,806 --> 00:25:56,676
in UI correction view?

412
00:25:57,306 --> 00:25:59,636
We do. And we are improving

413
00:25:59,636 --> 00:26:03,706
that by adding paging

414
00:25:59,636 --> 00:26:03,706
that by adding paging

415
00:26:04,366 --> 00:26:07,276
That's something that is exposed

416
00:26:07,276 --> 00:26:10,256
and correction view will now

417
00:26:11,656 --> 00:26:16,776
But, one feature this year,

418
00:26:16,776 --> 00:26:19,576
about for collection view

419
00:26:20,906 --> 00:26:23,316
It's a real simple,

420
00:26:24,156 --> 00:26:28,826
So, if I have a grid,

421
00:26:29,126 --> 00:26:31,336
and I'm going to

422
00:26:32,786 --> 00:26:37,506
At some point, I'm going to

423
00:26:38,076 --> 00:26:40,106
on screen at the same time.

424
00:26:40,756 --> 00:26:45,566
And if your cells are a

425
00:26:45,976 --> 00:26:48,936
it might take some time

426
00:26:49,996 --> 00:26:50,586
That's not great.

427
00:26:51,506 --> 00:26:55,496
So what we are doing

428
00:26:55,496 --> 00:26:57,146
that we call cell prefetching.

429
00:26:58,756 --> 00:27:04,586
The idea here is before we

430
00:26:58,756 --> 00:27:04,586
The idea here is before we

431
00:27:05,306 --> 00:27:08,826
we're going to ask you for

432
00:27:08,826 --> 00:27:14,246
to ask for a cell as a block

433
00:27:14,246 --> 00:27:17,656
We're going to ask for one

434
00:27:17,876 --> 00:27:22,566
So we're going to, amortize

435
00:27:22,566 --> 00:27:24,146
up in your application.

436
00:27:25,916 --> 00:27:28,686
A great thing about

437
00:27:28,686 --> 00:27:32,416
If you rebuild your

438
00:27:32,886 --> 00:27:35,236
you get that behavior

440

But there is more.

441
00:27:47,276 --> 00:27:54,016
We have a new protocol, we

442
00:27:54,916 --> 00:27:57,026
Because sometimes, it's not just

443
00:27:57,026 --> 00:27:59,556
about doing the layout

444
00:28:00,266 --> 00:28:01,806
Sometimes you need

445
00:28:03,116 --> 00:28:04,296
You need to read from the disc.

446
00:28:04,596 --> 00:28:08,516
You need to fetch data from the

447
00:28:08,516 --> 00:28:12,396
if we could tell you hey, we are

448
00:28:13,306 --> 00:28:15,316
So you can prepare, in advance.

449
00:28:17,006 --> 00:28:18,836
That's exactly what

450
00:28:19,336 --> 00:28:22,966
You implement a few delegate

451
00:28:22,966 --> 00:28:27,066
when we, are about

452
00:28:27,066 --> 00:28:28,626
so you can have the data ready.

453
00:28:29,086 --> 00:28:31,836

454
00:28:31,836 --> 00:28:33,926

reordering, don't miss this one.

461
00:29:04,716 --> 00:29:10,476
But I think the major new

462
00:29:11,276 --> 00:29:13,946
is something that we call the

463
00:29:15,366 --> 00:29:16,776
It's a new animation API.

464
00:29:18,286 --> 00:29:20,896
It's a new animation

465
00:29:20,896 --> 00:29:25,006
to let you build

466
00:29:25,526 --> 00:29:29,476
Animation you can scrub,

467
00:29:30,806 --> 00:29:34,626
We are exposing a new

468
00:29:35,156 --> 00:29:37,076
And it's fully dynamic.

469
00:29:37,886 --> 00:29:39,676
You can add animation

470
00:29:40,236 --> 00:29:44,416
And the way, I describe

471
00:29:45,046 --> 00:29:47,996
just like a timeline in a movie.

472
00:29:48,316 --> 00:29:52,666

00:29:53,216 --> 00:29:57,536
The model is really simple,

474
00:29:58,446 --> 00:30:02,206
You just have to

475
00:29:58,446 --> 00:30:02,206
You just have to

476
00:30:03,536 --> 00:30:05,996
You set the timing

477
00:30:06,356 --> 00:30:07,576
you add your animation.

478
00:30:08,036 --> 00:30:10,346
And you start the animation,

479
00:30:10,896 --> 00:30:14,566
that represent that animation,

480
00:30:15,066 --> 00:30:17,386
or change its progress.

481
00:30:19,046 --> 00:30:20,976

482
00:30:21,196 --> 00:30:24,816
in the view controller

in Advances in UI Animation

But I'd like to show you,

486
00:30:37,796 --> 00:30:43,896
So, this is a very simple

487
00:30:43,896 --> 00:30:47,216
that you could do before,

488
00:30:47,986 --> 00:30:49,156
in a navigation controller.

489
00:30:50,116 --> 00:30:54,996
But with this animation API,

490
00:30:55,526 --> 00:31:00,596
catch that mid flight

491
00:30:55,526 --> 00:31:00,596
catch that mid flight

492
00:31:01,736 --> 00:31:08,786
release it, and catch

493
00:31:08,996 --> 00:31:10,776
I'm going to reverse

494
00:31:11,756 --> 00:31:13,106
and let the animation finish.

495
00:31:14,196 --> 00:31:16,266
And what's amazing about that,

496
00:31:17,266 --> 00:31:19,306
is that it's just

497
00:31:19,706 --> 00:31:24,416

to interactive gesture driven

506
00:31:59,696 --> 00:32:04,106
And the key thing here

507
00:31:59,696 --> 00:32:04,106
And the key thing here

508
00:32:04,106 --> 00:32:06,186
that you absolutely

509
00:32:06,636 --> 00:32:09,176
No, it's quite the opposite,

to make your application better.

Features are going to

513
00:32:20,296 --> 00:32:23,376
Things that are going to measure

514
00:32:24,356 --> 00:32:26,996
A good example of that

515
00:32:27,566 --> 00:32:30,106
Is how we changed, openURL.

516
00:32:30,946 --> 00:32:33,756
So first, we made

517
00:32:34,456 --> 00:32:40,356
with a completion handler but we

518
00:32:40,666 --> 00:32:43,796
So you know universal link

519
00:32:44,986 --> 00:32:46,836
to a social network

520
00:32:46,836 --> 00:32:50,606
if you have a native app it's

521
00:32:51,496 --> 00:32:55,146
But now, with this new

522
00:32:56,386 --> 00:33:00,206
if there was an application

523
00:32:56,386 --> 00:33:00,206
if there was an application

524
00:33:00,936 --> 00:33:04,396
So if there was not, you can

525
00:33:04,396 --> 00:33:07,876
you can still keep

526
00:33:07,876 --> 00:33:10,356
of opening [inaudible]

527
00:33:10,856 --> 00:33:13,736
So that's going to really

528
00:33:14,036 --> 00:33:17,216
content and deal with those

529
00:33:18,636 --> 00:33:23,306
Another great feature, is the

530
00:33:24,536 --> 00:33:29,136
The first one is something

531
00:33:30,026 --> 00:33:35,276
The idea here is, it's quite

532
00:33:35,276 --> 00:33:39,956
for your menu I and

533
00:33:40,126 --> 00:33:43,796
on background queues,

534
00:33:44,776 --> 00:33:47,296
And what you can do is

535
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:54,006
you can actually pin,

536
00:33:54,776 --> 00:33:58,666
you can control exactly when you

537
00:33:59,346 --> 00:34:01,266
to another version

538
00:33:59,346 --> 00:34:01,266
to another version

539
00:34:01,946 --> 00:34:06,226
So it mean that you don't have

540
00:34:06,316 --> 00:34:07,976
because something changed

541
00:34:07,976 --> 00:34:12,686
because you can decide exactly

542
00:34:13,136 --> 00:34:14,326
to a new version of your data.

543
00:34:15,036 --> 00:34:16,706
That's a really great way

544
00:34:16,706 --> 00:34:20,266
to simplify your core data

545
00:34:20,746 --> 00:34:24,656
The other feature is,

546
00:34:25,186 --> 00:34:27,426
Now in a store we

547
00:34:27,426 --> 00:34:31,036
for a multiple reader,

548
00:34:31,036 --> 00:34:33,775
That's going to give you

549
00:34:34,306 --> 00:34:39,636
We also have, new features on

550
00:34:40,106 --> 00:34:42,235
I suggest you go

551
00:34:42,235 --> 00:34:45,606
in Core Data session on Friday.

552
00:34:47,446 --> 00:34:48,806
Another way to model data

553
00:34:48,806 --> 00:34:50,886
in your application

554
00:34:50,886 --> 00:34:56,235
So CloudKit, we already had

555
00:34:56,996 --> 00:35:00,616
and private per user databases.

556
00:34:56,996 --> 00:35:00,616
and private per user databases.

557
00:35:01,216 --> 00:35:04,646
And what we are adding in

558
00:35:05,196 --> 00:35:09,656
So you can have multiple users,

559
00:35:09,986 --> 00:35:12,686
So that's going to open

560
00:35:13,136 --> 00:35:14,766
of application with CloudKit.

561
00:35:16,336 --> 00:35:17,086
So that's great.

562
00:35:17,776 --> 00:35:21,426
But something that is

563
00:35:21,426 --> 00:35:26,146
with collaboration based app,

564
00:35:26,146 --> 00:35:30,546
How do you invite person to

565
00:35:31,466 --> 00:35:34,856
How do you do that in a way

566
00:35:35,496 --> 00:35:39,856
So we added the new UI

567
00:35:40,366 --> 00:35:42,466
Which is a view controller

568
00:35:42,466 --> 00:35:47,866
and it's really easy to use

569
00:35:48,046 --> 00:35:50,876
that is going to control

570
00:35:51,386 --> 00:35:55,716
And we're going to generate

571
00:35:56,056 --> 00:36:00,446
to manage the invitation

572
00:35:56,056 --> 00:36:00,446
to manage the invitation

573
00:36:01,206 --> 00:36:04,096
That's really easy to build

574
00:36:04,496 --> 00:36:05,296
in CloudKit.

575
00:36:05,916 --> 00:36:07,816
We have an entire

576
00:36:07,816 --> 00:36:10,316
What's New with CloudKit,

577
00:36:10,316 --> 00:36:11,906
in Presidio on Thursday.

578
00:36:14,096 --> 00:36:18,656
Now, I'd like to talk

579
00:36:19,526 --> 00:36:23,586
NS user activity is

580
00:36:23,586 --> 00:36:26,816
to capture the state,

581
00:36:27,436 --> 00:36:30,496
And, we are using that already,

582
00:36:30,826 --> 00:36:34,136
for things like Handoff

583
00:36:34,856 --> 00:36:38,506
What we are doing now, in iOS

584
00:36:38,506 --> 00:36:41,156
for locations in user activity.

585
00:36:41,156 --> 00:36:45,136
So if I'm in an application

586
00:36:45,756 --> 00:36:49,316
I can express that, the

587
00:36:50,806 --> 00:36:52,066
is about this address.

588
00:36:52,316 --> 00:36:56,936
So you just pass a map kit item

589
00:36:57,006 --> 00:37:02,006
and now you understand how

590
00:36:57,006 --> 00:37:02,006
and now you understand how

591
00:37:02,096 --> 00:37:04,136
in the text field

592
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:07,916
The system will notice

593
00:37:08,706 --> 00:37:10,156
is dealing with these addresses.

594
00:37:10,326 --> 00:37:12,006
So that's probably a

595
00:37:12,006 --> 00:37:14,756
for a text filed

596
00:37:15,036 --> 00:37:18,476
That's going to open completely

597
00:37:19,146 --> 00:37:20,606
if you had options

598
00:37:21,396 --> 00:37:25,576
We have many new ways you

599
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:29,186
of your application with what

600
00:37:29,186 --> 00:37:33,746
which is this intelligence

601
00:37:33,746 --> 00:37:36,436
features in iOS 10,

602
00:37:37,946 --> 00:37:45,996
Another place, where we use

603
00:37:46,746 --> 00:37:51,096
So in iOS 9, we added support

604
00:37:51,876 --> 00:37:57,776
It was real easy to use,

605
00:37:57,776 --> 00:37:59,806
and pass text field information

606
00:37:59,806 --> 00:38:02,146
and that would just

607
00:37:59,806 --> 00:38:02,146
and that would just

608
00:38:02,996 --> 00:38:04,816
But now what you can do is,

609
00:38:05,476 --> 00:38:07,936
we have a new button

610
00:38:09,006 --> 00:38:13,796
And, your user can now go

611
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:18,256
and you can continue

612
00:38:18,566 --> 00:38:19,696
in your own application.

613
00:38:20,376 --> 00:38:22,236
It's real easy to adopt.

614
00:38:22,236 --> 00:38:26,426
Step one, you need to add,

615
00:38:27,636 --> 00:38:31,066
to tell us that you support

616
00:38:31,616 --> 00:38:36,946
The second step is to

617
00:38:36,946 --> 00:38:37,716
delegate method.

618
00:38:38,676 --> 00:38:40,906
It's real easy to implement.

619
00:38:41,606 --> 00:38:45,206
We are giving you the user

620
00:38:45,246 --> 00:38:48,496
and display the search,

621
00:38:49,836 --> 00:38:54,576
The recent thing new also

622
00:38:55,606 --> 00:38:57,916
we added support for

623
00:38:58,206 --> 00:38:59,196
with Core Spotlight.

624
00:39:00,066 --> 00:39:05,256
But now you can actually search

625
00:39:05,296 --> 00:39:07,346
We are opening the

626
00:39:07,966 --> 00:39:09,416
And that's great

627
00:39:10,136 --> 00:39:14,636
a fully optimized implementation

628
00:39:14,836 --> 00:39:18,866
and performance and we have

629
00:39:19,406 --> 00:39:21,246
So it's real easy to use.

630
00:39:22,416 --> 00:39:28,536
You just build a search

631
00:39:29,296 --> 00:39:32,396
and you can search the

632
00:39:32,806 --> 00:39:37,416
So you can integrate

633
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:40,206
from [inaudible] coming from a

634
00:39:41,166 --> 00:39:46,256
We have a new session, this year

635
00:39:46,256 --> 00:39:48,406
to cover continuation,

636
00:39:49,246 --> 00:39:51,626
Core Spotlight search,

637
00:39:56,576 --> 00:39:59,836
We shipped Replay

638
00:39:59,836 --> 00:40:01,866
to record your screen

639
00:39:59,836 --> 00:40:01,866
to record your screen

640
00:40:02,306 --> 00:40:06,756
In iOS 10, you can use

641
00:40:07,756 --> 00:40:10,366
So you can have live

642
00:40:10,906 --> 00:40:14,766
of your application and because

643
00:40:14,766 --> 00:40:18,666
point, it mean that third-party

644
00:40:19,116 --> 00:40:21,486
that live broadcast ability.

645
00:40:21,486 --> 00:40:25,086
And we are using that for

646
00:40:29,336 --> 00:40:32,966
Another great framework

647
00:40:34,846 --> 00:40:38,676
SceneKit is really powerful

648
00:40:38,676 --> 00:40:43,066
to integrate 3D interactive

649
00:40:44,166 --> 00:40:47,466
The major new feature of

650
00:40:47,766 --> 00:40:50,606
rendering engine,

651
00:40:52,006 --> 00:40:55,896
I could say that it now

652
00:40:56,526 --> 00:40:59,456
or is internally using

653
00:40:59,456 --> 00:41:01,046
But I think that's

654
00:40:59,456 --> 00:41:01,046
But I think that's

655
00:41:02,246 --> 00:41:05,996
This is your fire

656
00:41:07,026 --> 00:41:10,026
This is your fire

657
00:41:10,836 --> 00:41:11,766
That's really amazing.

658
00:41:12,516 --> 00:41:16,916
[ Applause ]

659
00:41:17,416 --> 00:41:19,736
And it's now available

660
00:41:20,556 --> 00:41:23,406
We have a full session of

661
00:41:26,656 --> 00:41:29,476
Then I'd like to

662
00:41:30,766 --> 00:41:31,896
Two things about Apple Pay.

663
00:41:33,536 --> 00:41:38,186
First, we are extending

664
00:41:38,186 --> 00:41:40,316
to be available to your users.

665
00:41:41,096 --> 00:41:46,306
Today, Apple Pay is on

666
00:41:46,686 --> 00:41:49,416
and as you learned

667
00:41:49,416 --> 00:41:51,486
that Apple Pay on the web.

668
00:41:52,186 --> 00:41:54,626
We have support for

669
00:41:54,806 --> 00:41:57,456
So for users, Apple

670
00:41:58,676 --> 00:42:01,486
But what's great

671
00:41:58,676 --> 00:42:01,486
But what's great

672
00:42:02,136 --> 00:42:04,406
we already have support

673
00:42:04,506 --> 00:42:06,796
in your UIKit based application.

674
00:42:07,446 --> 00:42:10,706
But now, you can use

675
00:42:10,706 --> 00:42:12,906
with the new Javascript

676
00:42:13,366 --> 00:42:16,966
But it could also mean

677
00:42:17,356 --> 00:42:20,536
in your [inaudible]

678
00:42:21,356 --> 00:42:24,236
The other place where you

679
00:42:24,726 --> 00:42:26,976
is in non-UI code.

680
00:42:28,006 --> 00:42:31,086
We have a new API,

681
00:42:31,456 --> 00:42:36,346
And using Apple Pay in

682
00:42:36,346 --> 00:42:39,196
that's a great feature for

683
00:42:39,526 --> 00:42:43,626
This is the kind of flow

684
00:42:43,626 --> 00:42:45,516
in messages with an extension.

685
00:42:45,886 --> 00:42:50,316
I would like to point you to

686
00:42:50,696 --> 00:42:52,286
The first one that

687
00:42:52,286 --> 00:42:54,756
at the same time

688
00:42:54,856 --> 00:42:57,646
And just after that,

689
00:42:57,646 --> 00:42:58,866
in Wallet in Apple Pay.

690
00:43:01,636 --> 00:43:08,406
I would like to, finish with

691
00:43:08,756 --> 00:43:11,616
How you can integrate with iOS.

692
00:43:12,136 --> 00:43:17,556
We have major new

693
00:43:18,046 --> 00:43:21,266
messages, Siri, CallKit.

694
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:25,006
We also improved

695
00:43:25,006 --> 00:43:26,946
for instance something

696
00:43:27,346 --> 00:43:33,206
now you can use the same

697
00:43:33,526 --> 00:43:35,346
from your keyboard extension.

698
00:43:35,346 --> 00:43:38,706
We can also give you

699
00:43:39,066 --> 00:43:40,876
the user is interacting with.

700
00:43:41,256 --> 00:43:43,576
So you can build

701
00:43:43,576 --> 00:43:45,116
in your third-party extension.

702
00:43:46,276 --> 00:43:49,106
Another thing that we

703
00:43:49,486 --> 00:43:51,686
is the new display

704
00:43:52,246 --> 00:43:57,386
So, before, you were just,

705
00:43:57,386 --> 00:43:58,506
with you preferred size.

706
00:43:59,006 --> 00:44:02,006
Now we have a user

707
00:43:59,006 --> 00:44:02,006
Now we have a user

708
00:44:02,406 --> 00:44:08,226
The compact mode, which is fixed

709
00:44:08,426 --> 00:44:09,596
which is variable height.

710
00:44:10,196 --> 00:44:12,516
It's really easy to adopt.

711
00:44:12,516 --> 00:44:14,566
You don't have to do

712
00:44:14,726 --> 00:44:17,836
so you can know when the

713
00:44:17,836 --> 00:44:19,796
from compact to extended.

714
00:44:20,206 --> 00:44:23,536
You can give us a maximum size,

715
00:44:23,536 --> 00:44:26,356
You can customize the

716
00:44:27,106 --> 00:44:30,226
There is one thing that,

717
00:44:30,226 --> 00:44:35,006
widget though is, this is going

718
00:44:36,066 --> 00:44:41,146
So, be careful about the kind

719
00:44:41,776 --> 00:44:47,476
One thing to keep in mind is,

720
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:49,836
of data you're presenting

721
00:44:50,126 --> 00:44:52,596
If I configure, if

722
00:44:52,596 --> 00:44:54,446
to my home screen,

723
00:44:55,516 --> 00:44:58,556
I expect that I'm always going

724
00:44:58,556 --> 00:45:01,606
at the same level of privacy

725
00:44:58,556 --> 00:45:01,606
at the same level of privacy

726
00:45:01,606 --> 00:45:05,326
to be surprised by thing

727
00:45:05,636 --> 00:45:07,786
on my lock screen when

728
00:45:10,476 --> 00:45:14,966
A completely new framework in

729
00:45:15,656 --> 00:45:21,286
So user notification, that's

730
00:45:21,876 --> 00:45:23,606
at the UI application level.

731
00:45:24,216 --> 00:45:27,806
We have a new framework but, we

732
00:45:28,306 --> 00:45:30,426
We are adding a few

733
00:45:30,576 --> 00:45:35,506
First, we are unifying local

734
00:45:35,806 --> 00:45:37,806
So much easier to deal with.

735
00:45:38,516 --> 00:45:43,976
[ Applause ]

736
00:45:44,476 --> 00:45:48,076
You have better control on

737
00:45:48,526 --> 00:45:51,426
how we are going to deliver

738
00:45:52,706 --> 00:45:55,486
Another great thing is,

739
00:45:57,056 --> 00:45:58,916
before displaying

740
00:45:59,446 --> 00:46:02,606
So in-app, you have

741
00:45:59,446 --> 00:46:02,606
So in-app, you have

742
00:46:02,726 --> 00:46:04,316
on the notification itself.

743
00:46:05,896 --> 00:46:10,786
And, that's also a unified model

744
00:46:12,596 --> 00:46:15,876
In addition to these

745
00:46:17,016 --> 00:46:18,726
we also have two extensions.

746
00:46:19,706 --> 00:46:22,736
The first one is the

747
00:46:24,076 --> 00:46:27,516
The service extension is

748
00:46:28,256 --> 00:46:33,546
on the device when we are

749
00:46:33,546 --> 00:46:35,686
and before, it's

750
00:46:36,026 --> 00:46:41,586
So you can process the payload

751
00:46:42,316 --> 00:46:46,666
And, two great use cases, the

752
00:46:47,636 --> 00:46:53,296
You can have media attachment,

753
00:46:53,976 --> 00:46:57,346
But if you know what you want

00:46:57,346 --> 00:47:00,726
you can, when receiving

755
00:46:57,346 --> 00:47:00,726
you can, when receiving

756
00:47:01,046 --> 00:47:02,606
fetch that and display.

757
00:47:02,606 --> 00:47:07,026
And the other great feature

758
00:47:07,596 --> 00:47:10,466
because now you're in

759
00:47:10,856 --> 00:47:13,406
On the server and

760
00:47:13,906 --> 00:47:15,246
So you can receive something,

761
00:47:15,806 --> 00:47:17,986
and decrypt that

762
00:47:17,986 --> 00:47:20,366
We think that's a

763
00:47:20,706 --> 00:47:22,586
and great new possibility

764
00:47:23,516 --> 00:47:29,746
[ Applause ]

765
00:47:30,246 --> 00:47:32,826
This is the other

766
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:35,756
for the user notification

767
00:47:36,526 --> 00:47:41,636
You can have embedded UI

768
00:47:42,716 --> 00:47:46,266
There is one restriction though,

769
00:47:47,346 --> 00:47:51,246
with the view, but you have

770
00:47:52,086 --> 00:47:56,956
We have two session on user

771
00:47:56,956 --> 00:47:59,046
to Notification and

772
00:47:59,556 --> 00:48:00,886
in Pacific Heights on Wednesday.

773
00:47:59,556 --> 00:48:00,886
in Pacific Heights on Wednesday.

774
00:48:02,746 --> 00:48:07,226
Another new framework in

775
00:48:07,226 --> 00:48:09,926
we are offering a new

776
00:48:11,306 --> 00:48:13,316
The directory extension,

777
00:48:13,676 --> 00:48:18,516
we let you configure how we

778
00:48:19,656 --> 00:48:20,996
You have full control on that.

779
00:48:22,126 --> 00:48:27,746
The second feature is, how

780
00:48:28,066 --> 00:48:29,136
and display our label.

781
00:48:29,686 --> 00:48:32,836
So when we receive a call,

782
00:48:32,836 --> 00:48:37,246
in the address book and then

783
00:48:37,756 --> 00:48:39,186
we can add your extension.

784
00:48:39,776 --> 00:48:42,056
It's real easy to use API.

785
00:48:43,196 --> 00:48:45,576
It's non-UI extension point.

786
00:48:45,926 --> 00:48:47,716
It's really two methods.

787
00:48:48,416 --> 00:48:51,596
But the real great new feature

788
00:48:51,826 --> 00:48:55,496
in CallKit is the

789
00:48:56,496 --> 00:48:58,126
With the call provider API,

790
00:48:58,926 --> 00:49:01,936
we have a real first

791
00:48:58,926 --> 00:49:01,936
we have a real first

792
00:49:02,416 --> 00:49:05,156
for your voice over

793
00:49:05,516 --> 00:49:07,766
Which mean that now,

794
00:49:07,766 --> 00:49:10,556
like full screen

795
00:49:11,306 --> 00:49:12,826
when you receive a

796
00:49:13,276 --> 00:49:14,306
But it's not just that,

797
00:49:15,106 --> 00:49:17,336
we are fully integrating

798
00:49:18,166 --> 00:49:20,766
with a core management on iOS.

799
00:49:21,096 --> 00:49:25,676
And things like,

800
00:49:25,676 --> 00:49:29,416
we are automatically get, the

801
00:49:30,876 --> 00:49:33,136
You can support Siri,

802
00:49:33,256 --> 00:49:36,496
you will be integrated with

803
00:49:36,736 --> 00:49:39,256
That's a major new

804
00:49:40,516 --> 00:49:43,936
[ Applause ]

805
00:49:44,436 --> 00:49:47,186
We can learn all about

806
00:49:47,186 --> 00:49:49,266
Over IP apps with CallKit.

807
00:49:49,846 --> 00:49:54,846
I'd like to talk about Siri.

808
00:49:56,156 --> 00:49:59,846
So, you might not

809
00:50:00,486 --> 00:50:05,066
But Siri is actually

810
00:50:05,736 --> 00:50:07,006
depending on the context.

811
00:50:07,006 --> 00:50:11,516
So if you're using Siri,

812
00:50:11,786 --> 00:50:15,866
with the home button, or if

813
00:50:16,946 --> 00:50:19,576
or if you're using

814
00:50:20,926 --> 00:50:23,036
or as an accessibility feature.

815
00:50:24,146 --> 00:50:27,956
Siri is going to tune

816
00:50:28,166 --> 00:50:31,706
so you can have the best

817
00:50:33,446 --> 00:50:34,996
It's a quite complex task.

818
00:50:35,306 --> 00:50:38,396
Because it's involved

819
00:50:39,776 --> 00:50:42,996
understanding the domain,

820
00:50:43,346 --> 00:50:46,306
and that's something that we

821
00:50:46,896 --> 00:50:50,026
when you build a

822
00:50:50,486 --> 00:50:51,866
What we're going to give you,

823
00:50:52,396 --> 00:50:55,406
is an intent representing

824
00:50:55,466 --> 00:50:59,426
and that's how your extension

825
00:51:00,396 --> 00:51:05,816
And, you can also help Siri

826
00:51:06,346 --> 00:51:10,036
which might be specific to your

827
00:51:10,396 --> 00:51:13,426
so we can again,

828
00:51:13,866 --> 00:51:16,006
of the interaction with Siri.

829
00:51:17,156 --> 00:51:18,146
So how did that work?

830
00:51:18,296 --> 00:51:21,376
The idea behind intents

831
00:51:22,256 --> 00:51:25,926
it's a non-UI extension that

832
00:51:25,926 --> 00:51:28,306
between Siri and

833
00:51:29,556 --> 00:51:32,206
So it's based on the

834
00:51:32,576 --> 00:51:34,486
coming from Siri and responses.

835
00:51:34,786 --> 00:51:36,576
And the main idea here is,

836
00:51:36,946 --> 00:51:39,926
intents are a domain

837
00:51:40,246 --> 00:51:41,926
So you have the messaging

838
00:51:42,426 --> 00:51:44,096
the payment domain, etcetera.

839
00:51:44,306 --> 00:51:47,506
And for messaging, you

840
00:51:47,806 --> 00:51:52,046
that Siri can recognize

841
00:51:52,046 --> 00:51:55,626
to your application for

842
00:51:56,346 --> 00:52:01,306
So the main goal here, for

843
00:51:56,346 --> 00:52:01,306
So the main goal here, for

844
00:52:01,306 --> 00:52:05,686
to make sure that, you and

845
00:52:05,966 --> 00:52:07,686
when Siri understood a request.

846
00:52:08,066 --> 00:52:11,456
That valid request, that we need

847
00:52:11,456 --> 00:52:15,226
let's execute the request,

848
00:52:15,726 --> 00:52:19,076
And when you use Siri

849
00:52:19,446 --> 00:52:23,146
"tell Miko on WWDC chat

850
00:52:23,146 --> 00:52:26,186
after this session," what

851
00:52:26,186 --> 00:52:30,366
in the intent is the fact that,

852
00:52:30,796 --> 00:52:34,166
It's the same messaging intent,

853
00:52:34,556 --> 00:52:37,296
that's about your app and

854
00:52:37,866 --> 00:52:41,986
We have a second

855
00:52:42,476 --> 00:52:44,366
that the intents UI extension.

856
00:52:44,996 --> 00:52:46,786
It's actually an

857
00:52:47,326 --> 00:52:51,826
But with that you can embed

858
00:52:51,996 --> 00:52:55,696
so you can have a confirmation

859
00:52:56,106 --> 00:52:57,036
That's really great.

860
00:52:58,246 --> 00:53:02,336
And, another great thing

861
00:52:58,246 --> 00:53:02,336
And, another great thing

862
00:53:03,026 --> 00:53:05,626
it's not just about Siri.

863
00:53:05,626 --> 00:53:09,326
It's a way to describe the

864
00:53:09,326 --> 00:53:12,456
that in Siri to communicate

865
00:53:13,106 --> 00:53:15,896
But, that's also how we

866
00:53:16,216 --> 00:53:20,206
that's how we do the right

867
00:53:20,206 --> 00:53:22,436
And the reason the

868
00:53:22,496 --> 00:53:26,926
really great is that's how

869
00:53:26,926 --> 00:53:30,406
to the system about what

870
00:53:30,526 --> 00:53:32,396
For instance, in

871
00:53:33,096 --> 00:53:36,476
And it's combined with and

872
00:53:36,706 --> 00:53:38,976
and with that, let's say

873
00:53:38,976 --> 00:53:45,956
that I am sending a message

874
00:53:46,306 --> 00:53:51,506
then in the contacts UI, we're

875
00:53:51,506 --> 00:53:53,356
about this contacts

876
00:53:53,806 --> 00:53:56,416
And when we have,

877
00:53:57,526 --> 00:54:02,576
we can show you directly your

878
00:53:57,526 --> 00:54:02,576
we can show you directly your

879
00:54:02,576 --> 00:54:05,566
that information

880
00:54:06,466 --> 00:54:08,516
And at some point,

881
00:54:10,046 --> 00:54:12,646
your application will be

882
00:54:12,986 --> 00:54:14,866
in the standard contact card.

883
00:54:15,386 --> 00:54:17,106
That's really amazing in term

884
00:54:17,106 --> 00:54:20,186
of adding visibility

885
00:54:20,376 --> 00:54:25,556
I'd like to conclude

886
00:54:26,726 --> 00:54:30,306
So, messages is really

887
00:54:30,306 --> 00:54:34,866
and we have two features

888
00:54:35,606 --> 00:54:38,146
and the other one is

889
00:54:38,476 --> 00:54:43,316
So sticker packs, no code

890
00:54:43,376 --> 00:54:47,406
to package your images,

891
00:54:48,006 --> 00:54:53,246
You use Xcode for that and

892
00:54:53,246 --> 00:54:54,956
that on the messages store.

893
00:54:56,196 --> 00:54:58,796
The other thing you can do,

894
00:54:59,286 --> 00:55:03,116
with iMessage apps is use

895
00:54:59,286 --> 00:55:03,116
with iMessage apps is use

896
00:55:03,686 --> 00:55:08,116
With that you can write, a

897
00:55:08,816 --> 00:55:10,816
and you can do things like,

898
00:55:11,546 --> 00:55:14,866
dynamically generating

899
00:55:15,236 --> 00:55:17,526
You can even use a

900
00:55:17,526 --> 00:55:18,686
which is completely new.

901
00:55:19,256 --> 00:55:22,826
And, you can tune your

902
00:55:22,826 --> 00:55:26,906
or expanded mode and that's

903
00:55:27,206 --> 00:55:29,836
that's a great feature

904
00:55:29,836 --> 00:55:32,746
You can custom the

905
00:55:33,296 --> 00:55:35,206
it mean that your extension,

906
00:55:35,436 --> 00:55:39,026
using the messages

907
00:55:39,446 --> 00:55:44,266
a concept of a conversation in

908
00:55:44,526 --> 00:55:48,506
connect with what the

909
00:55:48,646 --> 00:55:51,106
We have full support

910
00:55:51,576 --> 00:55:53,286
in [inaudible] and iOS 10.

911
00:55:53,286 --> 00:55:57,826
That's real easy to use and

912
00:55:58,276 --> 00:55:59,816
to integrate in messages.

913
00:56:01,686 --> 00:56:05,186
The other thing that you can

914
00:56:05,186 --> 00:56:10,556
completely custom content

915
00:56:10,716 --> 00:56:16,476
We have two session for iMessage

916
00:56:16,476 --> 00:56:20,066
and sticker, that was this

917
00:56:20,066 --> 00:56:23,876
focusing on the extension part

918
00:56:23,876 --> 00:56:27,976
at 1:40 p.m. Thank you
