Good afternoon, and welcome to

I'm excited to spend some times

00:00:42,896 --> 00:00:44,676
about what we've been up

10
00:00:46,896 --> 00:00:50,046
Now iTunes Connect covers the

00:00:50,046 --> 00:00:52,996
from uploading the metadata,

to see how well you're

14
00:00:57,396 --> 00:00:59,546
And so, today we're

15
00:00:59,546 --> 00:01:02,176
of these different

of these different

17
00:01:03,616 --> 00:01:06,896
We're going to start with

to in-app purchases and

19
00:01:10,896 --> 00:01:13,236
about iTunes Connect for iOS,

our mobile companion

21
00:01:19,276 --> 00:01:21,596
We're also going to

22
00:01:22,226 --> 00:01:24,626
and what's new with

23
00:01:25,206 --> 00:01:29,356
And then something

24
00:01:29,446 --> 00:01:30,966
which is screenshot

25
00:01:31,046 --> 00:01:34,076
and this is about the

26
00:01:34,076 --> 00:01:37,966
about uploading images and

27
00:01:39,716 --> 00:01:41,886
We want to talk a little

00:01:41,886 --> 00:01:44,736
what you have to do in iTunes

29
00:01:44,736 --> 00:01:46,486
and submit your iMessage apps.

And then we're going to finish

31
00:01:50,996 --> 00:01:53,706
So let's get started.

32
00:01:53,706 --> 00:01:56,646
We're going to talk

00:02:16,086 --> 00:02:17,006
that can use autorenewables.

Everybody's eligible

43
00:02:19,326 --> 00:02:22,156
Now we're also introducing

44
00:02:22,206 --> 00:02:25,966
so that you can price your

00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:26,966
in each territory.

46
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:31,286
Instead of selecting one price

47
00:02:31,696 --> 00:02:33,856
you can select individual

48
00:02:34,686 --> 00:02:37,246
And to go along with that, we're

to the subscriptions is

56
00:02:57,506 --> 00:02:59,296
Now this is for your

or you can let them keep

61

so when they renew,

00:08:57,386 --> 00:09:01,036
So that's multiprovider support,

193
00:09:01,036 --> 00:09:03,106
of you that work with

194
00:09:05,036 --> 00:09:08,216
Resolution Center, this was the

195
00:09:08,216 --> 00:09:11,146
in the past year, full

196
00:09:11,206 --> 00:09:12,666
within the mobile app.

197
00:09:13,026 --> 00:09:14,226
Let me show you what

198
00:09:16,366 --> 00:09:19,316
Anywhere within the mobile

199
00:09:19,316 --> 00:09:23,376
of your apps, either in recents,

200
00:09:24,396 --> 00:09:27,306
any of your apps that have

201
00:09:27,306 --> 00:09:28,886
will be displayed

202
00:09:29,956 --> 00:09:31,026
Let's tap into one of those.

203
00:09:31,026 --> 00:09:34,286
So you can see at the top

204
00:09:34,286 --> 00:09:37,586
of the view it gives you a

205
00:09:37,586 --> 00:09:40,576
of active issues you have and

206
00:09:40,896 --> 00:09:41,956
Let's tap on that header.

207
00:09:44,696 --> 00:09:46,856
Here you can see the

208
00:09:47,226 --> 00:09:49,056
and you can get a

209
00:09:49,056 --> 00:09:50,956
of all the replies

210
00:09:51,756 --> 00:09:54,676
If you tap on the reply

211
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:57,996
you have the option here

212
00:09:57,996 --> 00:10:02,666
on through email to another

00:09:57,996 --> 00:10:02,666
on through email to another

214
00:10:03,596 --> 00:10:08,006
or you can reply directly

215
00:10:08,006 --> 00:10:10,526
to the App Review team.

216
00:10:11,426 --> 00:10:16,576
When App Review responds, you

217
00:10:16,846 --> 00:10:18,706
so you can deal with

218
00:10:18,706 --> 00:10:23,426
So that's the Resolution

219
00:10:23,896 --> 00:10:24,976
It's just one of the three --

220
00:10:29,316 --> 00:10:30,996
So that's the Resolution

221
00:10:32,316 --> 00:10:34,686
Now let's talk about

222
00:10:35,286 --> 00:10:41,176
Now there's one feature

223
00:10:41,176 --> 00:10:46,236
of this list for most

224
00:10:46,536 --> 00:10:50,396
the ability to see exactly

225
00:10:50,726 --> 00:10:54,636
in gross sales and proceeds

226
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:57,646
I am happy to say that

227
00:10:57,646 --> 00:10:59,976
in our next release, and I would

228
00:11:04,076 --> 00:11:06,226
So this is the Sales and

229
00:11:06,226 --> 00:11:07,176
when you sign in today.

230
00:11:08,486 --> 00:11:10,616
On the left side, you'll

231
00:11:10,616 --> 00:11:13,646
for each line item, and on

232
00:11:13,646 --> 00:11:16,606

00:11:16,636 --> 00:11:18,676
between the current

234
00:11:18,676 --> 00:11:19,836
and the previous period.

235
00:11:21,546 --> 00:11:23,966
Much like the stocks app,

236
00:11:23,966 --> 00:11:26,406
and green rectangles, you

237
00:11:27,266 --> 00:11:31,116
So let's tap on it, and now

238
00:11:31,116 --> 00:11:32,276
for each of these line items.

239
00:11:32,896 --> 00:11:37,216
If we tap on it again, now we're

240
00:11:38,536 --> 00:11:40,146
As we tap through

241
00:11:40,146 --> 00:11:42,726
the graph at the bottom

242
00:11:42,726 --> 00:11:44,606

Let's look at sales.

258
00:12:30,576 --> 00:12:31,166
Then we hit back.

259
00:12:31,746 --> 00:12:33,596
So now we're displaying

00:12:34,136 --> 00:12:35,286
on a per day basis.

261

So we're going to do that now.

276
00:13:24,186 --> 00:13:26,836
First off, you want

277
00:13:27,026 --> 00:13:30,596
Mine's very easy to find because

278
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:33,646
And you can see we

279
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,056
One is currently

280
00:13:35,196 --> 00:13:37,266
We don't want to be

281
00:13:37,366 --> 00:13:39,936
And our second one is

282
00:13:41,356 --> 00:13:42,626
So let's look at

283
00:13:42,626 --> 00:13:46,006
And you can see we

284
00:13:46,356 --> 00:13:49,556
We can either release this

285
00:13:49,686 --> 00:13:51,356
We don't want to reject

286
00:13:51,986 --> 00:13:53,726
So we're going to tap

287
00:13:53,726 --> 00:13:56,886
and it will give us

288
00:13:56,926 --> 00:13:59,336
because we don't want you

289
00:13:59,336 --> 00:14:00,116
or release your binary.

290
00:13:59,336 --> 00:14:00,116
or release your binary.

291
00:14:00,116 --> 00:14:02,466

So let's talk about

323
00:15:15,396 --> 00:15:16,776
Why are analytics important?

324
00:15:17,986 --> 00:15:20,576
First, analytics

325
00:15:20,896 --> 00:15:22,386
Are customers finding my app?

326
00:15:22,386 --> 00:15:24,466
Are customers downloading

327
00:15:24,466 --> 00:15:25,646
Are they using my app?

328
00:15:25,646 --> 00:15:26,656
How stable is my app?

329
00:15:27,266 --> 00:15:28,476
These are some of the questions

330
00:15:28,476 --> 00:15:29,996
that App Analytics

331
00:15:30,486 --> 00:15:34,826
Next, App Analytics reveals

332
00:15:35,326 --> 00:15:37,666
Perhaps you have a large

333
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:38,646
and you didn't realize

334
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:40,526
that customers were

335
00:15:40,966 --> 00:15:42,936
Well, that's an opportunity

336
00:15:42,936 --> 00:15:44,506
and localize your

337
00:15:44,876 --> 00:15:49,266
And App Analytics can help you

338
00:15:49,466 --> 00:15:52,386
Next, App Analytics helps

339
00:15:52,526 --> 00:15:55,036
There's been a lot of great

340
00:15:55,036 --> 00:15:56,666
design and build great apps.

341
00:15:56,886 --> 00:15:59,396
But we believe that building

342
00:15:59,396 --> 00:16:00,826
when you release

343
00:15:59,396 --> 00:16:00,826
when you release

344
00:16:01,766 --> 00:16:05,056
It's important to continue

345
00:16:05,056 --> 00:16:07,776
and App Analytics can

346
00:16:07,826 --> 00:16:09,636
to make great decisions

347
00:16:09,866 --> 00:16:15,126
So let's talk about the types of

348
00:16:15,996 --> 00:16:18,156
First, we provide

349
00:16:18,806 --> 00:16:21,216
This is data about how many

350
00:16:21,216 --> 00:16:23,886
on the App Store, how many

351
00:16:23,886 --> 00:16:24,806
your app.

352
00:16:26,016 --> 00:16:28,436
Next, we provide sales data.

353
00:16:28,776 --> 00:16:31,146
This is data about how much

354
00:16:31,146 --> 00:16:35,806
in your app, how many users

355
00:16:35,806 --> 00:16:39,256
and how much -- and how many

356
00:16:39,256 --> 00:16:40,966
in your app.

357
00:16:41,026 --> 00:16:43,126
And finally, there's usage data.

358
00:16:43,616 --> 00:16:46,206
This is data about how

359
00:16:46,206 --> 00:16:48,476
your app, what your

360
00:16:48,476 --> 00:16:50,396
and how stable your app is.

361
00:16:51,036 --> 00:16:53,896
So with this data, we're able

362
00:16:53,896 --> 00:16:55,716
from the time that

363
00:16:55,716 --> 00:16:58,396
with App Store data

364
00:16:58,396 --> 00:17:00,106
with customers with usage data.

365
00:16:58,396 --> 00:17:00,106
with customers with usage data.

366
00:17:00,346 --> 00:17:02,946
But today, we're primarily

367
00:17:02,946 --> 00:17:04,695
on updates to App Store data.

368
00:17:04,826 --> 00:17:10,425
And App Store data starts

369
00:17:11,356 --> 00:17:15,156
Every time a customer views your

370
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:17,006
this registers a

371
00:17:17,566 --> 00:17:20,516
So, for example, we have

372
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:21,935
and this is our product page.

373
00:17:22,215 --> 00:17:23,185
Customer views this.

374
00:17:23,286 --> 00:17:25,036
This would count as

375
00:17:25,726 --> 00:17:28,916
If a customer goes on to

376
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:30,176
They purchase our app.

377
00:17:30,176 --> 00:17:32,136
This would count as an app unit.

378
00:17:32,496 --> 00:17:35,186
So app units help you track

379
00:17:35,186 --> 00:17:37,226
that you have in any

380
00:17:38,156 --> 00:17:41,146
So this helps you understand

381
00:17:41,146 --> 00:17:42,356
You're able to see

382
00:17:42,356 --> 00:17:43,626
that your product

383
00:17:43,626 --> 00:17:45,866
You're able to see the

384
00:17:46,476 --> 00:17:49,846
But it doesn't tell the whole

385
00:17:50,196 --> 00:17:52,696
because it doesn't tell

386
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:55,006
in the App Store that

387
00:17:55,346 --> 00:17:57,486
And so, to help you

388
00:17:57,796 --> 00:18:00,976
we're introducing a new

389
00:17:57,796 --> 00:18:00,976
we're introducing a new

390
00:18:01,516 --> 00:18:07,076
[ Applause ]

391
00:18:07,576 --> 00:18:10,606
So impressions are going to

392
00:18:10,606 --> 00:18:12,926
that customers have viewed

393
00:18:13,366 --> 00:18:15,716
So we talked about one way

394
00:18:15,716 --> 00:18:17,476
That's your product page.

395
00:18:17,476 --> 00:18:19,186
But let's talk about other ways

396
00:18:19,186 --> 00:18:20,846
that customers view your

397
00:18:22,176 --> 00:18:23,506
First, there's search.

398
00:18:24,086 --> 00:18:26,426
A customer searches for

399
00:18:26,696 --> 00:18:28,876
and our app Trip Guide shows

400
00:18:29,086 --> 00:18:30,796
This will count as an

401
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:35,526
If you're taking advantage

402
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:38,326
and your app shows up in

403
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:39,986
this will also count

404
00:18:40,546 --> 00:18:44,706
If your app shows up

405
00:18:45,756 --> 00:18:48,726
or in our top charts or

406
00:18:48,726 --> 00:18:51,866
that will register

407
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:55,176
So this is the new

408
00:18:55,176 --> 00:18:57,266
Let's take a look at what this

409
00:18:57,266 --> 00:19:00,096
This is the App List.

410
00:18:57,266 --> 00:19:00,096
This is the App List.

411
00:19:00,096 --> 00:19:03,626
This the entry point to

412
00:19:04,566 --> 00:19:07,506
From here, you can see a

413
00:19:07,506 --> 00:19:10,256
and Apple TV apps

414
00:19:10,536 --> 00:19:11,926
starting with your impressions

415
00:19:11,956 --> 00:19:13,596
to see how many customers

416
00:19:13,596 --> 00:19:15,516
on the App Store, app units

417
00:19:15,516 --> 00:19:17,256
to tell you how many

418
00:19:17,796 --> 00:19:21,056
sales to tell you how much

419
00:19:21,056 --> 00:19:24,716
or on your app, sessions to tell

420
00:19:24,716 --> 00:19:27,916
have opened your app, and

421
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,706
of how stable your app is.

422
00:19:30,646 --> 00:19:33,416
We show you the value for

423
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:35,486
as the percentage change

424
00:19:35,706 --> 00:19:38,876
to help you understand whether

425
00:19:40,186 --> 00:19:41,536
So we can see our

426
00:19:41,706 --> 00:19:42,896
It's in the first row here.

427
00:19:42,996 --> 00:19:46,056
And we can see that

428
00:19:46,056 --> 00:19:48,456
we had around 300,000

429
00:19:48,646 --> 00:19:51,716
This is a 17 percent increase

430
00:19:51,716 --> 00:19:55,186
If we want to find out more

431
00:19:55,496 --> 00:19:56,796
you can click into that number,

432
00:19:56,856 --> 00:19:58,546
and it'll take you

433
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:02,406
So the metrics view allows

434
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:02,406
So the metrics view allows

435
00:20:02,406 --> 00:20:04,486
of more information about

436
00:20:04,486 --> 00:20:06,986
You can see this data

437
00:20:07,226 --> 00:20:10,526
and you can also slice this

438
00:20:10,756 --> 00:20:11,706
if you want to see something --

439
00:20:11,706 --> 00:20:13,206
drill down to something

440
00:20:13,206 --> 00:20:17,016
perhaps how many impression you

441
00:20:18,026 --> 00:20:20,736
In addition to providing

442
00:20:21,206 --> 00:20:25,346
we're also providing unique

443
00:20:25,736 --> 00:20:27,876
So if you select

444
00:20:27,876 --> 00:20:30,456
down to just the unique

445
00:20:30,456 --> 00:20:33,086
So if I were to view

446
00:20:33,086 --> 00:20:35,976
on the App Store three times

447
00:20:36,186 --> 00:20:38,056
that would count as

448
00:20:38,246 --> 00:20:40,316
but one unique impression.

449
00:20:41,356 --> 00:20:45,196
So if I select that, now I'm

450
00:20:45,196 --> 00:20:45,976
for impressions.

451
00:20:46,726 --> 00:20:49,986
This helps us better understand

452
00:20:50,106 --> 00:20:52,206
who are viewing our

453
00:20:52,206 --> 00:20:53,396
at any given time period.

454
00:20:54,446 --> 00:20:57,186
With this, we can start

455
00:20:57,696 --> 00:21:00,556
to the number of new users we

456
00:20:57,696 --> 00:21:00,556
to the number of new users we

457
00:21:00,556 --> 00:21:03,006
to understand our App

458
00:21:03,186 --> 00:21:06,996
how well our App Store presence

459
00:21:07,346 --> 00:21:08,386
So I'll walk you through that.

460
00:21:09,366 --> 00:21:13,086
You can select compare to

461
00:21:14,336 --> 00:21:17,066
Now you're viewing app units

462
00:21:17,066 --> 00:21:19,226
on the same graph, but

463
00:21:19,226 --> 00:21:20,726
to view this data as a ratio.

464
00:21:21,186 --> 00:21:25,276
So if you change from single

465
00:21:25,816 --> 00:21:29,446
now you can view this as

466
00:21:29,846 --> 00:21:31,696
and we can see that

467
00:21:31,896 --> 00:21:35,746
it takes about ten

468
00:21:35,856 --> 00:21:39,226
And so, we can start to --

469
00:21:39,226 --> 00:21:41,726
and our description to our

470
00:21:41,726 --> 00:21:45,366
to see what effect that has on

471
00:21:46,036 --> 00:21:50,066
So that's the impression feature

472
00:21:50,066 --> 00:21:51,786
to look at your App

473
00:21:51,916 --> 00:21:53,336
And we're excited to announce

474
00:21:53,336 --> 00:21:55,796
that all this is available

475
00:21:56,516 --> 00:22:00,786
[ Applause ]

476
00:21:56,516 --> 00:22:00,786
[ Applause ]

477
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:03,756
So let's talk about what's

478
00:22:04,886 --> 00:22:07,196
We've given you impressions to

479
00:22:07,196 --> 00:22:09,386
of customers that are viewing

480
00:22:10,216 --> 00:22:11,296
but the next question we want

481
00:22:11,296 --> 00:22:15,916
to help you answer is how

482
00:22:16,096 --> 00:22:18,636
And we do this today

483
00:22:19,376 --> 00:22:22,136
And so, let's talk about what

484
00:22:22,136 --> 00:22:24,906
for customers to find

485
00:22:29,046 --> 00:22:31,586
The first source is

486
00:22:31,746 --> 00:22:33,426
So we talked about

487
00:22:33,426 --> 00:22:34,896
with searching on the App Store.

488
00:22:34,896 --> 00:22:35,986
We've searched for guides.

489
00:22:36,256 --> 00:22:40,646
That's one way that

490
00:22:40,906 --> 00:22:44,056
Similarly, if we were to find

491
00:22:44,056 --> 00:22:47,676
in the top charts, in featured,

492
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:50,486
these are all ways that

493
00:22:50,766 --> 00:22:52,106
by browsing the App Store.

494
00:22:52,106 --> 00:22:56,256
So that's one source for

495
00:22:56,436 --> 00:22:58,416
But we recognize that

496
00:22:58,686 --> 00:23:02,556
that customers are finding your

497
00:22:58,686 --> 00:23:02,556
that customers are finding your

498
00:23:02,916 --> 00:23:04,696
And so, the first source

499
00:23:04,696 --> 00:23:07,426
about outside of the

500
00:23:08,066 --> 00:23:12,556
So websites are tracked any

501
00:23:12,696 --> 00:23:15,336
from a website in Mobile

502
00:23:15,336 --> 00:23:16,286
to the App Store page.

503
00:23:16,906 --> 00:23:19,526
This counts as a

504
00:23:20,306 --> 00:23:23,836
So we have our app Trip Guide

505
00:23:23,836 --> 00:23:25,996
on our website,

506
00:23:26,336 --> 00:23:29,576
This would be a situation

507
00:23:29,576 --> 00:23:31,676
and the website is

508
00:23:32,206 --> 00:23:36,096
So that's one source

509
00:23:36,096 --> 00:23:40,426
where customers can find your

510
00:23:40,636 --> 00:23:41,876
The other source that

511
00:23:41,876 --> 00:23:44,046
about for customers to

512
00:23:44,046 --> 00:23:46,976
of the App Store are other apps.

513
00:23:47,546 --> 00:23:52,606
So for example, we tweeted

514
00:23:52,666 --> 00:23:54,706
and we included a link

515
00:23:54,706 --> 00:23:57,036
We're trying to promote our

516
00:23:57,216 --> 00:23:58,486
Someone follows that link.

517
00:23:58,486 --> 00:24:02,036
That would be an

518
00:23:58,486 --> 00:24:02,036
That would be an

519
00:24:02,036 --> 00:24:05,396
where the source was another

520
00:24:06,906 --> 00:24:10,456
Similarly, if customers are

521
00:24:10,556 --> 00:24:13,856
if you're taking advantage

522
00:24:13,856 --> 00:24:16,946
in iOS 10 and customers are

523
00:24:17,466 --> 00:24:18,786
these are other examples

524
00:24:19,136 --> 00:24:21,086
of where the source

525
00:24:21,336 --> 00:24:22,646
for customers to find your app.

526
00:24:23,146 --> 00:24:25,726
And the apps here would

527
00:24:26,476 --> 00:24:28,866
Okay. So those are the

528
00:24:28,866 --> 00:24:31,306
for how customers

529
00:24:31,306 --> 00:24:32,586
Let's take a look at how we plan

530
00:24:32,586 --> 00:24:37,326
to visualize this

531
00:24:37,406 --> 00:24:39,616
First, if you've been

532
00:24:39,796 --> 00:24:41,516
you're probably familiar

533
00:24:41,916 --> 00:24:43,816
This is the list of

534
00:24:44,506 --> 00:24:46,126
From here, you're able to see

535
00:24:46,126 --> 00:24:49,006
which websites are driving

536
00:24:49,226 --> 00:24:51,556
and not only are you able to

537
00:24:51,626 --> 00:24:54,326
that came from these websites,

538
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:55,536
that across your app units

539
00:24:55,536 --> 00:24:58,586
to understand how many new

540
00:24:58,976 --> 00:25:00,616
You're able to see the sales

541
00:24:58,976 --> 00:25:00,616
You're able to see the sales

542
00:25:00,616 --> 00:25:03,056
to understand how much money

543
00:25:03,056 --> 00:25:04,266
who came from each website.

544
00:25:04,426 --> 00:25:07,176
And you're able to see sessions

545
00:25:07,516 --> 00:25:09,226
from customers who

546
00:25:09,456 --> 00:25:12,616
So we talked about the Twitter

547
00:25:12,846 --> 00:25:16,516
Well, if a customer also is

548
00:25:16,516 --> 00:25:19,196
from Twitter.com in

549
00:25:19,196 --> 00:25:20,856
up under your top websites.

550
00:25:21,156 --> 00:25:21,546
All right.

551
00:25:22,296 --> 00:25:25,106
So that's the list

552
00:25:25,366 --> 00:25:26,416
Let's talk about how we plan

553
00:25:26,416 --> 00:25:29,446
to visualize the list

554
00:25:31,236 --> 00:25:32,656
This is the App List.

555
00:25:33,296 --> 00:25:37,606
From here, you're able to view

556
00:25:37,756 --> 00:25:40,086
to traffic for customers

557
00:25:40,766 --> 00:25:43,206
So we talked -- again,

558
00:25:43,206 --> 00:25:44,746
the Twitter mobile app.

559
00:25:44,746 --> 00:25:45,536
It'll show up here.

560
00:25:45,946 --> 00:25:48,916
Messages, if that's a source

561
00:25:49,156 --> 00:25:50,436
this will show up here as well.

562
00:25:50,916 --> 00:25:52,316
So as you start to

563
00:25:52,316 --> 00:25:55,716
across many different

564
00:25:56,416 --> 00:25:58,926
which channels are the

565
00:25:58,926 --> 00:26:02,016
to compare them not just across

566
00:25:58,926 --> 00:26:02,016
to compare them not just across

567
00:26:02,016 --> 00:26:03,956
of the measures that

00:26:03,956 --> 00:26:04,936
on App Analytics today.

[ Applause ]

570
00:26:12,496 --> 00:26:17,386
So that's the new app sources

571
00:26:17,386 --> 00:26:18,786
Next we're going to

572
00:26:18,786 --> 00:26:20,996
to visualize the three sources

573
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:22,186
that I talked to

574
00:26:22,276 --> 00:26:25,616
And the first way is

575
00:26:26,226 --> 00:26:29,716
With the Source Overview, we're

576
00:26:29,936 --> 00:26:32,406
into each of these three sources

577
00:26:32,666 --> 00:26:35,046
which of these three

578
00:26:35,046 --> 00:26:38,206
to the most customers

579
00:26:38,746 --> 00:26:41,626
So you can see customers

580
00:26:41,626 --> 00:26:44,386
from browsing the App

581
00:26:44,386 --> 00:26:46,526
from an app refer,

582
00:26:46,526 --> 00:26:48,576
from a web refer,

583
00:26:48,576 --> 00:26:50,816
And you can see a percentage

584
00:26:51,356 --> 00:26:52,936
Right now, we're

585
00:26:53,416 --> 00:26:56,136
but you can also look at

586
00:26:56,136 --> 00:26:57,856
So again, you can

587
00:26:57,856 --> 00:26:59,976
You can look at your sessions

588
00:26:59,976 --> 00:27:02,306
and understand how

589
00:26:59,976 --> 00:27:02,306
and understand how

590
00:27:02,306 --> 00:27:03,506
that came from each source.

591
00:27:04,266 --> 00:27:07,286
And so, we talked before about

592
00:27:07,286 --> 00:27:09,826
and how you're able to look at

593
00:27:10,196 --> 00:27:12,516
Well, you could also look at

594
00:27:12,986 --> 00:27:14,286
across each of these sources.

595
00:27:14,286 --> 00:27:15,886
So let's do that.

596
00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:20,666
When we left off in the

597
00:27:20,666 --> 00:27:21,866
in the App Store

598
00:27:21,866 --> 00:27:24,796
If we want to view this rate

599
00:27:25,066 --> 00:27:26,086
we can select view by.

600
00:27:26,116 --> 00:27:29,856
And you can see in there we have

601
00:27:29,856 --> 00:27:30,966
We could look at territory

602
00:27:30,966 --> 00:27:33,546
to understand how our App

603
00:27:33,576 --> 00:27:34,576
on each territory.

604
00:27:34,976 --> 00:27:36,736
But for right now, we're

605
00:27:37,096 --> 00:27:40,356
And so, if we select

606
00:27:40,356 --> 00:27:42,936
to see our App Store

607
00:27:42,936 --> 00:27:44,696
of the three sources

608
00:27:44,886 --> 00:27:46,196
and better understand

609
00:27:46,326 --> 00:27:51,036
which source is converting

610
00:27:51,206 --> 00:27:53,196
So that's the new sources

611
00:27:53,196 --> 00:27:54,456
to visualize it in the product.

612
00:27:54,766 --> 00:27:56,976

and a little bit

617
00:28:06,056 --> 00:28:07,256

Thanks, David.

622

That's what's new

623
00:28:23,176 --> 00:28:25,016
So let's talk about

624
00:28:25,546 --> 00:28:30,016
And to talk about this,

625
00:28:30,016 --> 00:28:33,776
to take a step back and think

626
00:28:33,776 --> 00:28:37,056
So you can have up to

627
00:28:37,056 --> 00:28:40,626
of your devices that give

628
00:28:40,976 --> 00:28:42,226
into what's going on in your app

629
00:28:42,416 --> 00:28:43,436
when they're browsing

630
00:28:43,986 --> 00:28:48,496
And since we give

631
00:28:48,846 --> 00:28:52,016
for each device size, when

632
00:28:53,176 --> 00:28:55,296
that's going to give

633
00:28:56,256 --> 00:29:01,266
As you start to include

634
00:28:56,256 --> 00:29:01,266
As you start to include

635
00:29:02,556 --> 00:29:04,326
that number increases to 30,

636
00:29:04,326 --> 00:29:08,206
and this is before you've even

637
00:29:08,706 --> 00:29:11,906
And we support up to

638
00:29:11,906 --> 00:29:14,556
on iTunes Connect and the

639
00:29:14,556 --> 00:29:17,136
up to 840 different

00:29:17,466 --> 00:29:19,226
And we haven't even

641
00:29:21,546 --> 00:29:24,006
With Apple Watch, that

642
00:29:24,006 --> 00:29:26,156
to 980 screenshots,

643
00:29:26,446 --> 00:29:27,716
There's a lot of power in this

644
00:29:28,276 --> 00:29:31,526
because you can actually

645
00:29:32,596 --> 00:29:34,626
for the right device and

646
00:29:34,996 --> 00:29:38,576
But you don't always

647
00:29:39,856 --> 00:29:42,646
and that's what screenshot

648
00:29:43,286 --> 00:29:46,556
and how we can simplify

649
00:29:46,556 --> 00:29:48,686
of screenshots per

00:29:55,396 --> 00:29:57,806
So let's see what this is going

654
00:29:57,806 --> 00:29:59,926
So we're going to start

655
00:29:59,956 --> 00:30:02,226
and the first thing

656
00:29:59,956 --> 00:30:02,226
and the first thing

657
00:30:02,226 --> 00:30:05,906
at the top we just have the

658
00:30:06,626 --> 00:30:10,986
And now the [inaudible] will

659
00:30:10,986 --> 00:30:13,206
screenshots, the 5-1/2 inch.

660
00:30:13,736 --> 00:30:17,026
So we drag those on in.

661
00:30:17,576 --> 00:30:18,466
They fill in.

662
00:30:18,776 --> 00:30:20,246
We have our app preview first,

663
00:30:20,556 --> 00:30:22,486
followed by our five

664
00:30:23,386 --> 00:30:26,616
And if we want to see our other

665
00:30:26,876 --> 00:30:29,156
We can open it up,

666
00:30:29,156 --> 00:30:30,916
that automatically we've begun

667
00:30:30,916 --> 00:30:33,806
to share those screenshots I

668
00:30:33,806 --> 00:30:35,466
down to these smaller sizes.

669
00:30:36,266 --> 00:30:38,686
In fact, if we zoom in,

670
00:30:38,686 --> 00:30:39,976
on the screenshot where

671
00:30:44,256 --> 00:30:47,886
And if we want to change

672
00:30:47,886 --> 00:30:50,526
for these other sizes,

673
00:30:50,526 --> 00:30:52,276
of iTunes Connect

674
00:30:53,586 --> 00:30:54,396
Now let's look into this.

675
00:30:54,836 --> 00:30:57,276
This Media Manager is going

676
00:30:57,306 --> 00:30:59,756
about all those screenshots

677
00:31:00,076 --> 00:31:02,326
across different languages

678
00:31:02,326 --> 00:31:06,546
So you can see at the top we

679
00:31:06,546 --> 00:31:09,426
and they've been shared down

680
00:31:09,936 --> 00:31:13,056
In fact, if we change

681
00:31:13,056 --> 00:31:16,136
for the 5-1/2 inch, it's

682
00:31:16,136 --> 00:31:16,756
that have been shared.

683
00:31:18,236 --> 00:31:21,226
But not every app looks

684
00:31:21,786 --> 00:31:25,526
on the 5-1/2 inch iPhone as

685
00:31:25,526 --> 00:31:27,856
So you may want to

686
00:31:27,856 --> 00:31:29,756
that are more specific

687
00:31:30,846 --> 00:31:35,376
In order to do that,

688
00:31:35,376 --> 00:31:36,576
for our 4.7 inch.

689
00:31:37,346 --> 00:31:40,286
We're going to stop sharing

690
00:31:40,326 --> 00:31:42,686
and that's going to clear

691
00:31:43,956 --> 00:31:47,086
We simply drag in the

692
00:31:47,576 --> 00:31:53,136
and now these screenshots

693
00:31:53,136 --> 00:31:54,446
with those that are smaller.

694
00:31:54,446 --> 00:31:57,376
We're going to find the

695
00:31:57,376 --> 00:31:59,096
from which we can

696
00:31:59,666 --> 00:32:05,436
Now if we want to localize our

697
00:31:59,666 --> 00:32:05,436
Now if we want to localize our

698
00:32:05,466 --> 00:32:07,576
we can do the same thing

699
00:32:09,036 --> 00:32:10,916
So let's pick German.

700
00:32:11,876 --> 00:32:15,036
When we look at our German

701
00:32:15,666 --> 00:32:19,906
we're going to see that the

702
00:32:19,906 --> 00:32:21,446
came from my default

703
00:32:21,446 --> 00:32:23,176
in this case my US English.

704
00:32:23,726 --> 00:32:28,516
And the 4.7 are copied from

705
00:32:28,676 --> 00:32:32,106
If I want to upload

706
00:32:32,236 --> 00:32:36,146
I can come here to my

707
00:32:36,146 --> 00:32:38,136
and this is actually

708
00:32:38,136 --> 00:32:39,206
of my screenshots for German.

709
00:32:39,356 --> 00:32:41,626
We're going to favor your

710
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:43,906
over all else.

711
00:32:44,516 --> 00:32:47,886
So now we can drag in my

712
00:32:47,886 --> 00:32:50,446
and they're going to fill in

713
00:32:50,446 --> 00:32:51,156
but everything down below.

714
00:32:51,686 --> 00:32:57,466
And since my German app

715
00:32:57,706 --> 00:33:00,756
on these different

716
00:32:57,706 --> 00:33:00,756
on these different

717
00:33:01,206 --> 00:33:03,676
uncheck the sharing

718
00:33:04,416 --> 00:33:08,136
They get cleared out, and I

719
00:33:08,566 --> 00:33:10,766
And that's it.

720
00:33:10,766 --> 00:33:12,676
And that's how we use

721
00:33:13,536 --> 00:33:17,836
There's two different

722
00:33:17,916 --> 00:33:20,306
We start with iPhone and iPad

723
00:33:20,306 --> 00:33:22,776
across all the different

724
00:33:22,776 --> 00:33:24,006
as the different

725
00:33:24,006 --> 00:33:26,996
But there are some device types

726
00:33:27,646 --> 00:33:30,236
Apple Watch, Apple

727
00:33:30,866 --> 00:33:32,956
You can still use

728
00:33:33,116 --> 00:33:34,756
but in this case, all

729
00:33:34,756 --> 00:33:36,286
across are the localizations.

730
00:33:36,786 --> 00:33:42,536
What if you do want to still

731
00:33:43,466 --> 00:33:46,646
Well, the best way to do that

732
00:33:47,086 --> 00:33:49,966
This is a command line

733
00:33:49,966 --> 00:33:52,366
that lets you upload

734
00:33:52,806 --> 00:33:56,286
all your app previews, as well

735
00:33:56,286 --> 00:33:57,716
You can set your

736
00:33:58,166 --> 00:34:00,486
You can include metadata

737
00:33:58,166 --> 00:34:00,486
You can include metadata

738
00:34:00,856 --> 00:34:02,636
your leaderboards, and

739
00:34:02,636 --> 00:34:05,156
And if you want more

740
00:34:05,156 --> 00:34:08,426
you can go to the Resources and

741
00:34:09,016 --> 00:34:11,786
or last year we had a great

742
00:34:11,786 --> 00:34:14,396
out of iTunes Connect, where

743
00:34:14,576 --> 00:34:17,406
to Transporter XML Feed.

744
00:34:18,755 --> 00:34:20,735
So what is screenshot

745
00:34:20,946 --> 00:34:23,525
Quite simply, create only

746
00:34:23,525 --> 00:34:27,076
that you need and share those

747
00:34:28,206 --> 00:34:30,085
And this will be

748
00:34:30,085 --> 00:34:33,456
Now I want to talk

749
00:34:33,456 --> 00:34:36,186
This is a great new

750
00:34:36,186 --> 00:34:37,386
so you can really interact

751
00:34:37,386 --> 00:34:39,576
with the people using

752
00:34:39,706 --> 00:34:41,846
And we wanted to touch

753
00:34:41,846 --> 00:34:44,596
on iTunes Connect to get these

754
00:34:45,536 --> 00:34:49,746
We tried to make it as simple

755
00:34:49,746 --> 00:34:50,936
to what you're already doing.

756
00:34:51,896 --> 00:34:52,786
So the first thing is,

757
00:34:53,286 --> 00:34:55,126
is if you're creating a

758
00:34:55,326 --> 00:34:57,616
then we have a new category

759
00:34:58,396 --> 00:35:00,686
with some more subcategories,

760
00:34:58,396 --> 00:35:00,686
with some more subcategories,

761
00:35:01,196 --> 00:35:07,586
And the second thing is we

762
00:35:07,586 --> 00:35:08,366
for your iMessage apps.

763
00:35:08,366 --> 00:35:11,856
So you can show what it'll be

764
00:35:11,856 --> 00:35:13,866
of messages, and

765
00:35:13,866 --> 00:35:15,626
on the App Store

766
00:35:16,166 --> 00:35:20,526
Now how does this work

767
00:35:21,336 --> 00:35:24,046
iMessage apps behave

768
00:35:24,206 --> 00:35:26,296
in that we have different

769
00:35:26,346 --> 00:35:29,066
so you can show how it works

770
00:35:29,136 --> 00:35:30,436
as across localizations.

771
00:35:31,056 --> 00:35:34,136
And this works the same way

772
00:35:34,376 --> 00:35:38,686
Now if you want to know more

773
00:35:39,026 --> 00:35:40,926
we have two great

774
00:35:41,006 --> 00:35:42,676
If you didn't get a

775
00:35:42,676 --> 00:35:44,186
I encourage you to

776
00:35:44,186 --> 00:35:48,496
And that's what it

777
00:35:48,496 --> 00:35:50,716
to use your iMessage

778
00:35:50,806 --> 00:35:54,406
Now the last thing

779
00:35:54,406 --> 00:35:55,836
about today are the

780
00:35:56,376 --> 00:36:01,016
And those of you who

781
00:35:56,376 --> 00:36:01,016
And those of you who

782
00:36:01,016 --> 00:36:02,146
of "What's New on

783
00:36:02,736 --> 00:36:05,416
know that often we take this

784
00:36:06,136 --> 00:36:08,136
about do they have any

785
00:36:08,136 --> 00:36:11,636
to maybe get your app through

786
00:36:12,046 --> 00:36:15,416
or perhaps some common stumbling

787
00:36:15,516 --> 00:36:17,786
And this year, we're going to

788
00:36:17,786 --> 00:36:18,566
for a couple of reasons.

789
00:36:18,976 --> 00:36:23,186
The first is that App Review

790
00:36:23,216 --> 00:36:24,826
and we've worked really

791
00:36:26,516 --> 00:36:31,136
[ Applause ]

792
00:36:31,636 --> 00:36:34,016
And the second is that

793
00:36:34,016 --> 00:36:37,006
to hopefully make it easier

794
00:36:37,006 --> 00:36:39,236
to the questions, and you

795
00:36:39,236 --> 00:36:39,836
much faster.

796
00:36:40,386 --> 00:36:44,696
So the biggest change in

797
00:36:44,696 --> 00:36:45,396
in which they're worded.

798
00:36:45,586 --> 00:36:46,856
You could call it

799
00:36:47,316 --> 00:36:50,806
Instead of a list of things,

800
00:36:50,806 --> 00:36:54,096
we've really tried to give you

801
00:36:54,096 --> 00:36:55,826
and what are the best ways

802
00:36:55,826 --> 00:36:56,966
to get your app ready

803
00:37:01,166 --> 00:37:05,126
In fact, we've also

804
00:37:05,446 --> 00:37:09,106
for when you're ready to submit

805
00:37:09,266 --> 00:37:14,146
on things you can be thinking

806
00:37:14,146 --> 00:37:17,336
to go when I submit to App

807
00:37:17,336 --> 00:37:18,056
to go on the App Store?

808
00:37:19,336 --> 00:37:21,396
Does your app require a

809
00:37:22,026 --> 00:37:23,736
If that's the case,

810
00:37:23,736 --> 00:37:25,896
that on iTunes Connect before

811
00:37:27,596 --> 00:37:30,376
These guidelines are

812
00:37:30,516 --> 00:37:33,216
so you can understand them,

813
00:37:33,216 --> 00:37:34,896
In fact, how many people

814
00:37:34,896 --> 00:37:35,686
App Guidelines?

815
00:37:36,226 --> 00:37:38,206
So that's not enough.

816
00:37:38,426 --> 00:37:39,546
Those at home can't see this.

817
00:37:40,656 --> 00:37:42,716
It takes about 20 to

818
00:37:42,716 --> 00:37:45,096
and read the guidelines and

819
00:37:46,676 --> 00:37:50,106
The great thing about

820
00:37:50,106 --> 00:37:52,596
in English is it's much

821
00:37:52,596 --> 00:37:54,916
to be human readable in Spanish

822
00:37:55,796 --> 00:37:58,066
And so, we've localized in

823
00:37:58,066 --> 00:37:59,136
to ten different languages.

824
00:38:02,356 --> 00:38:07,256
We've also combined our macOS

825
00:38:07,256 --> 00:38:09,606
You only have one place

826
00:38:09,606 --> 00:38:12,426
to what is appropriate

827
00:38:15,156 --> 00:38:16,186
And lastly, I want to talk

828
00:38:16,186 --> 00:38:17,926
about the organization

829
00:38:19,086 --> 00:38:21,116
We want to try to make

830
00:38:21,116 --> 00:38:26,306
to find answers to questions

831
00:38:26,466 --> 00:38:29,456
and getting it through App

832
00:38:29,456 --> 00:38:32,576
from more of a feature-based

833
00:38:34,016 --> 00:38:35,696
And so, we broke this

834
00:38:35,986 --> 00:38:39,316
And in fact, it kind

835
00:38:39,316 --> 00:38:40,656
of the changes with

836
00:38:40,656 --> 00:38:43,536
We've created a comic book and

837
00:38:43,536 --> 00:38:45,296
into five different

838
00:38:46,086 --> 00:38:47,476
So let's talk about

839
00:38:48,606 --> 00:38:51,796
The first is safety, and

840
00:38:52,386 --> 00:38:56,006
of the people using your app,

841
00:38:56,006 --> 00:38:57,926
for kids, if it's safe for kids.

842
00:38:58,986 --> 00:39:00,026
And also, are the

843
00:38:58,986 --> 00:39:00,026
And also, are the

844
00:39:00,026 --> 00:39:01,496
to be using your

845
00:39:01,496 --> 00:39:02,696
to themselves or to the device?

846
00:39:02,696 --> 00:39:05,916
It's that kind of safety.

847
00:39:07,516 --> 00:39:08,886
The next area is performance.

848
00:39:09,396 --> 00:39:11,996
What kind of hardware

849
00:39:11,996 --> 00:39:12,786
How is it running?

850
00:39:13,266 --> 00:39:17,256
Then we can talk about business.

851
00:39:17,956 --> 00:39:21,416
Is your app appropriate

852
00:39:21,626 --> 00:39:23,216
How does it work

853
00:39:23,216 --> 00:39:25,676
Do you have a alternate

854
00:39:26,536 --> 00:39:27,626
You want to understand what kind

855
00:39:27,626 --> 00:39:29,646
of business models are

856
00:39:30,516 --> 00:39:32,946
You can check with the

857
00:39:33,466 --> 00:39:39,166
Let me talk with design

858
00:39:39,356 --> 00:39:40,036
for the App Store?

859
00:39:40,496 --> 00:39:47,976
Simple, refined,

860
00:39:48,186 --> 00:39:50,226
And last, everybody's

861
00:39:50,226 --> 00:39:53,926
A couple of people

862
00:39:54,426 --> 00:39:58,656
This is where we can talk

863
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:01,096
intellectual property,

864
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:01,096
intellectual property,

865
00:40:01,926 --> 00:40:04,096
If you want to know when do I

866
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:06,066
and more information about

867
00:40:06,546 --> 00:40:10,336
And these are our different

868
00:40:11,056 --> 00:40:14,216
Again, instead of reading

869
00:40:14,216 --> 00:40:17,136
out that you need a privacy

870
00:40:17,236 --> 00:40:20,556
or you need a privacy

871
00:40:20,686 --> 00:40:22,546
why don't you instead

872
00:40:22,546 --> 00:40:24,316
out what are the rules

873
00:40:25,586 --> 00:40:27,426
In order to help

874
00:40:27,426 --> 00:40:29,056
to the questions

875
00:40:29,596 --> 00:40:32,866
And those are our

876
00:40:34,736 --> 00:40:36,246
So what's new in iTunes Connect?

877
00:40:36,556 --> 00:40:38,776
Well, we've got the

878
00:40:38,776 --> 00:40:40,656
with subscriptions

879
00:40:41,196 --> 00:40:44,356
We have updates to

880
00:40:45,006 --> 00:40:47,126
with a Resolution

881
00:40:47,126 --> 00:40:50,306
and just released changes

882
00:40:51,376 --> 00:40:54,046
We also talked about the

883
00:40:54,046 --> 00:40:57,866
to App Analytics

884
00:40:58,416 --> 00:41:00,106
Screenshot simplification

885
00:40:58,416 --> 00:41:00,106
Screenshot simplification

886
00:41:00,106 --> 00:41:04,516
to create just the screenshots

887
00:41:04,516 --> 00:41:05,596
and sizes that work for you.

888
00:41:06,176 --> 00:41:09,296
We talked about what

889
00:41:09,296 --> 00:41:11,286
to get your iMessage apps

890
00:41:11,286 --> 00:41:14,556
through iTunes Connects and the

891
00:41:15,096 --> 00:41:19,146
If you have any more questions,

892
00:41:19,146 --> 00:41:21,716
from our sessions URL here

893
00:41:22,716 --> 00:41:24,526
We talked about these

894
00:41:24,796 --> 00:41:26,216
I'm putting them here so

895
00:41:26,216 --> 00:41:28,436
And with that, I hope you've

896
00:41:28,436 --> 00:41:30,046
and a great week, and

897
00:41:30,306 --> 00:41:30,976
Thanks a lot.
