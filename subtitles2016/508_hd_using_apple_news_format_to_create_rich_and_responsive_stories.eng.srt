00:00:26,046 --> 00:00:29,596
&gt;&gt; Hello. Welcome to the

4
00:00:29,646 --> 00:00:32,665
My name's Casey and today my

5
00:00:32,665 --> 00:00:35,316
to show you how you can

6
00:00:35,316 --> 00:00:38,836
and engaging articles for news

7
00:00:39,406 --> 00:00:40,966
By the end of today's session,

8
00:00:40,966 --> 00:00:42,936
you will have a detailed

9
00:00:43,026 --> 00:00:46,146
of all the design capabilities

10
00:00:47,116 --> 00:00:49,746
as well as an understanding

11
00:00:49,746 --> 00:00:50,816
to construct those stories.

12
00:00:51,866 --> 00:00:53,456
Believe it or not,

13
00:00:53,456 --> 00:00:55,196
to identify some efficiencies

14
00:00:55,236 --> 00:00:56,786
between your design

15
00:00:57,726 --> 00:01:01,326
Dan's going to cover a variety

16
00:00:57,726 --> 00:01:01,326
Dan's going to cover a variety

17
00:01:01,326 --> 00:01:04,256
to create some beautiful

18
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:08,016
of magazine-type style,

19
00:01:08,016 --> 00:01:12,256
like drop caps, side bars,

20
00:01:12,786 --> 00:01:16,056
With the Apple News Format,

21
00:01:16,056 --> 00:01:19,916
to look amazing on the iPad

22
00:01:20,036 --> 00:01:23,906
and they will effortlessly

23
00:01:24,086 --> 00:01:28,636
That's because the Apple News

24
00:01:29,106 --> 00:01:32,406
It ensures that your stories are

25
00:01:33,406 --> 00:01:36,266
So, obviously there's a

26
00:01:36,266 --> 00:01:39,326
into here today, but first

27
00:01:39,326 --> 00:01:40,856
that I give you a bit of context

28
00:01:40,856 --> 00:01:42,516
around the News Application

29
00:01:42,706 --> 00:01:46,066
And that's because

30
00:01:46,066 --> 00:01:48,606
for how users are

31
00:01:48,606 --> 00:01:49,906
and experience your stories.

32
00:01:50,306 --> 00:01:55,026
News is a news aggregator

33
00:01:55,026 --> 00:01:59,566
it comes preinstalled on the iOS

34
00:01:59,566 --> 00:02:01,326
Okay. That's really

35
00:01:59,566 --> 00:02:01,326
Okay. That's really

36
00:02:01,326 --> 00:02:02,346
News aggregator.

37
00:02:03,036 --> 00:02:06,886
I prefer to think of news as

38
00:02:07,776 --> 00:02:11,836
News helps readers find stories

39
00:02:12,076 --> 00:02:15,286
And that's really great news for

40
00:02:15,286 --> 00:02:18,006
that they get to find new fans.

41
00:02:18,206 --> 00:02:22,756
News makes its recommendations

42
00:02:22,756 --> 00:02:24,376
that a reader chooses to follow.

43
00:02:24,576 --> 00:02:26,796
And then it places

44
00:02:27,116 --> 00:02:29,126
into the readers For You feed.

45
00:02:30,226 --> 00:02:34,426
And that For You feed is

46
00:02:34,426 --> 00:02:36,386
for users, and publishers alike.

47
00:02:36,946 --> 00:02:40,316
As a reader, I can find anything

48
00:02:40,316 --> 00:02:43,116
from CNN to craft beer.

49
00:02:43,726 --> 00:02:46,286
Oh, this is Eddy's For You Feed,

50
00:02:46,286 --> 00:02:51,276
so Formula 1 racing

51
00:02:52,056 --> 00:02:54,426
At any case, the point

52
00:02:54,516 --> 00:02:56,836
such a breadth of

53
00:02:56,836 --> 00:02:59,096
And that breadth, it

54
00:02:59,156 --> 00:03:01,196
that anybody can

55
00:02:59,156 --> 00:03:01,196
that anybody can

56
00:03:01,996 --> 00:03:06,266
You can publish today and

57
00:03:06,266 --> 00:03:07,336
and begin earning revenue.

58
00:03:07,336 --> 00:03:09,976
And you can do that using

59
00:03:09,976 --> 00:03:15,286
Including RSS, the News

60
00:03:15,826 --> 00:03:16,916
and the Apple News Format.

61
00:03:17,556 --> 00:03:19,886
If you haven't checked it

62
00:03:19,886 --> 00:03:23,056
out the Getting Started

63
00:03:23,056 --> 00:03:24,256
it was earlier this week.

64
00:03:24,256 --> 00:03:25,686
It's available on video now.

65
00:03:25,976 --> 00:03:29,086
That session reviews all

66
00:03:29,226 --> 00:03:32,466
This section focuses just

67
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,756
And that's because the Apple

68
00:03:36,046 --> 00:03:38,246
for any number of things

69
00:03:38,246 --> 00:03:40,746
including HAN authoring

70
00:03:41,316 --> 00:03:45,156
maybe creating a translation

71
00:03:45,156 --> 00:03:48,376
so that you can programmatically

72
00:03:48,376 --> 00:03:51,586
and stories from your CMS to

73
00:03:52,196 --> 00:03:55,406
Or, even for contributing to

74
00:03:55,406 --> 00:03:58,096
for platforms, like

75
00:03:59,366 --> 00:04:02,006
Knowing the Apple News Format is

76
00:03:59,366 --> 00:04:02,006
Knowing the Apple News Format is

77
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:04,636
And, it's just JSON.

78
00:04:05,876 --> 00:04:10,926
The Apple News Format uses

79
00:04:10,926 --> 00:04:13,366
that are both performant

80
00:04:14,016 --> 00:04:18,326
JSON is also really great for

81
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:23,426
and it allows us to have

82
00:04:23,426 --> 00:04:26,086
And that extensible nature

83
00:04:26,186 --> 00:04:29,426
of the Apple News

84
00:04:29,616 --> 00:04:33,216
because it allows us to

85
00:04:33,646 --> 00:04:35,456
without any additional

86
00:04:36,396 --> 00:04:39,216
So I feel like we've given you

87
00:04:39,216 --> 00:04:40,166
around News.

88
00:04:40,586 --> 00:04:43,786
So now we can really jump

89
00:04:43,856 --> 00:04:45,056
of the Apple News Format.

90
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:46,566
Here's Dan to take it away.

91
00:04:48,176 --> 00:04:48,816
&gt;&gt; Thank you Casey.

92
00:04:49,866 --> 00:04:51,996
So now that you have

93
00:04:51,996 --> 00:04:54,676
in which these articles

94
00:04:54,676 --> 00:04:56,356
and bolts of how you

95
00:04:56,676 --> 00:04:57,476
with Apple News Format.

96
00:04:57,476 --> 00:04:59,006
So what we're going to

97
00:04:59,006 --> 00:05:01,916
to take this sample

98
00:04:59,006 --> 00:05:01,916
to take this sample

99
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:02,866
to tear it down to the skeleton.

100
00:05:02,866 --> 00:05:04,986
And then we're going

101
00:05:04,986 --> 00:05:06,406
up so we understand

102
00:05:06,766 --> 00:05:08,986
We're going to make

103
00:05:09,056 --> 00:05:11,736
And then finally we're going

104
00:05:12,956 --> 00:05:15,156
So here's our article skeleton.

105
00:05:15,996 --> 00:05:17,386
Let's dig into some of

106
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:19,496
Our first property is title.

107
00:05:20,266 --> 00:05:22,116
And this is a title as

108
00:05:22,116 --> 00:05:23,096
who are browsing the feed.

109
00:05:23,646 --> 00:05:27,396
Next, we have excerpt, our

110
00:05:28,016 --> 00:05:29,586
And this is the snippet

111
00:05:29,646 --> 00:05:31,706
with the title also in the feed.

112
00:05:32,446 --> 00:05:34,836
And finally, you get to

113
00:05:35,066 --> 00:05:36,206
using a thumbnail URL.

114
00:05:37,066 --> 00:05:38,556
Now let's step back

115
00:05:38,556 --> 00:05:40,296
about a few thumbnail

116
00:05:40,806 --> 00:05:43,726
So first of all,

117
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:47,246
for thumbnails are JPEG and PNG.

118
00:05:47,516 --> 00:05:49,656
Second, definitely send

119
00:05:50,216 --> 00:05:52,866
We'll take care of

120
00:05:54,176 --> 00:05:57,086
The pizel size is

121
00:05:57,086 --> 00:05:59,836
If you go smaller than that your

122
00:05:59,836 --> 00:06:01,186
So definitely sent us your best.

123
00:05:59,836 --> 00:06:01,186
So definitely sent us your best.

124
00:06:01,316 --> 00:06:04,776
And we do have a few

125
00:06:04,776 --> 00:06:05,936
of width height ratios.

126
00:06:06,476 --> 00:06:08,986
So for thumbnail

127
00:06:08,986 --> 00:06:10,986
at least as wide as 1 to 2.

128
00:06:11,786 --> 00:06:15,676
But no wider than 3 to 1.

129
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:16,356
Moving on.

130
00:06:16,356 --> 00:06:18,366
Our last piece on metadata

131
00:06:18,366 --> 00:06:19,886
about today is cannonicalURL.

132
00:06:19,886 --> 00:06:22,956
And this is simply a web

133
00:06:23,616 --> 00:06:26,076
And if you have one, definitely

134
00:06:26,566 --> 00:06:29,096
It's going to be really

135
00:06:29,536 --> 00:06:30,906
shares your article to a friend

136
00:06:30,906 --> 00:06:32,246
who doesn't have

137
00:06:32,806 --> 00:06:34,286
Having that one version

138
00:06:34,286 --> 00:06:36,056
on will make a much

139
00:06:36,406 --> 00:06:39,546
So we talked about metadata.

140
00:06:40,196 --> 00:06:41,466
Let's dive into the content.

141
00:06:42,296 --> 00:06:44,596
So, content lives

142
00:06:44,596 --> 00:06:46,486
in your article,

143
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:50,576
And, each of your pieces

144
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:53,336
by a JSON object which

145
00:06:53,576 --> 00:06:57,246
Each one has a semantic

146
00:06:57,356 --> 00:06:59,436
intro, byline, and body.

147
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:02,646
Choosing the most

148
00:07:02,646 --> 00:07:04,736
for your content is

149
00:07:04,736 --> 00:07:08,896
So we touched on semantics,

150
00:07:08,896 --> 00:07:10,876
but what if you want

151
00:07:11,376 --> 00:07:13,306
So this is where

152
00:07:14,396 --> 00:07:16,756
And component textiles is

153
00:07:16,756 --> 00:07:19,186
And we're going to

154
00:07:19,186 --> 00:07:20,116
in three different layers.

155
00:07:20,116 --> 00:07:22,636
So the first one we're

156
00:07:22,636 --> 00:07:25,166
to make a default style, that's

157
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:26,386
for all of our text components.

158
00:07:26,766 --> 00:07:30,696
Then, we're going to define a

159
00:07:30,996 --> 00:07:33,006
that are going to

160
00:07:33,776 --> 00:07:36,396
And finally we're going to

161
00:07:36,486 --> 00:07:38,766
And this is for when you need

162
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:43,116
Okay, so here's our

163
00:07:43,726 --> 00:07:45,186
And let's take a look at

164
00:07:45,696 --> 00:07:46,566
First we have font name.

165
00:07:47,566 --> 00:07:50,006
And one thing to keep in mind

166
00:07:50,436 --> 00:07:52,816
declare your font is not

167
00:07:53,586 --> 00:07:54,776
So keep two things in mind.

168
00:07:55,586 --> 00:07:58,846
First of all, when referencing

169
00:07:58,846 --> 00:08:01,956
by their postscript name,

170
00:07:58,846 --> 00:08:01,956
by their postscript name,

171
00:08:02,716 --> 00:08:06,046
And two, the fonts that you use

172
00:08:06,776 --> 00:08:09,766
So, if you wanted to channel

173
00:08:09,766 --> 00:08:12,826
skills, you could make the real

174
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:14,156
using these postscript names.

175
00:08:14,676 --> 00:08:17,936
Next we have text color.

176
00:08:18,406 --> 00:08:19,906
Text color takes a hex value.

177
00:08:19,906 --> 00:08:22,206
You can use the shorter

178
00:08:22,926 --> 00:08:25,276
Or if you need alpha, you can

179
00:08:26,976 --> 00:08:28,146
Then we have font size.

180
00:08:28,356 --> 00:08:30,016
And font size is

181
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:32,056
But we shorthand

182
00:08:32,056 --> 00:08:34,426
Now, just because

183
00:08:34,426 --> 00:08:35,926
don't think of this

184
00:08:36,566 --> 00:08:40,356
The app's going to take your

185
00:08:40,356 --> 00:08:43,775
at it on different devices, it's

186
00:08:43,966 --> 00:08:44,976
to optimize legibility.

187
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:49,076
And that said, a good

188
00:08:49,076 --> 00:08:51,076
to go below 16 points

189
00:08:51,836 --> 00:08:56,056
On a similar note, line height's

190
00:08:56,776 --> 00:08:58,546
And you want to define

191
00:08:58,546 --> 00:09:00,676
to the font size you've

192
00:08:58,546 --> 00:09:00,676
to the font size you've

193
00:09:00,676 --> 00:09:02,056
that ratio across devices.

194
00:09:02,636 --> 00:09:05,446
And finally we have

195
00:09:05,686 --> 00:09:07,836
So this is where you get

196
00:09:08,436 --> 00:09:12,316
for any links that appear in

197
00:09:12,316 --> 00:09:13,646
Here [inaudible]

198
00:09:13,856 --> 00:09:15,426
but there's certainly

199
00:09:15,426 --> 00:09:16,236
from adding an underline.

200
00:09:16,236 --> 00:09:22,306
So now that we have

201
00:09:22,476 --> 00:09:24,966
let's add our first

202
00:09:25,366 --> 00:09:28,816
So this one has a special

203
00:09:28,816 --> 00:09:29,696
It's called default body.

204
00:09:29,696 --> 00:09:32,286
And this is going to lay

205
00:09:32,286 --> 00:09:35,946
for any body component, with

206
00:09:35,946 --> 00:09:39,396
We have ParagraphSpacingBefore

207
00:09:39,886 --> 00:09:42,596
And as you would hope, they

208
00:09:42,596 --> 00:09:44,536
But what does it mean

209
00:09:44,536 --> 00:09:45,756
in a component based system.

210
00:09:47,356 --> 00:09:49,236
So let's take a look at

211
00:09:49,866 --> 00:09:52,176
And this one component actually

212
00:09:53,406 --> 00:09:54,186
That's our first one.

213
00:09:54,526 --> 00:09:56,396
And that's our second one.

214
00:09:57,226 --> 00:10:00,206
And we divide them with two

215
00:09:57,226 --> 00:10:00,206
And we divide them with two

216
00:10:01,176 --> 00:10:04,476
And speaking of which,

217
00:10:04,546 --> 00:10:05,516
format declaration.

218
00:10:06,086 --> 00:10:08,526
In Apple News Format, you get

219
00:10:08,576 --> 00:10:10,416
and markdown for

220
00:10:11,456 --> 00:10:13,936
And in this case, we're taking

221
00:10:14,386 --> 00:10:19,336
with this markdown

222
00:10:19,496 --> 00:10:21,326
Whether you choose plain

223
00:10:21,446 --> 00:10:23,466
you can use these

224
00:10:23,866 --> 00:10:26,396
to effect the spacing

225
00:10:26,396 --> 00:10:26,896
your component.

226
00:10:27,446 --> 00:10:33,296
So now that we've seen how to

227
00:10:33,336 --> 00:10:36,906
let's just quickly hammer

228
00:10:37,046 --> 00:10:39,556
So for our heading up top,

229
00:10:39,896 --> 00:10:41,516
so to give some breathing

230
00:10:42,116 --> 00:10:45,356
Kicked up the size of the

231
00:10:46,776 --> 00:10:48,386
lightened up the intro.

232
00:10:49,496 --> 00:10:51,396
So, subtle changes

233
00:10:51,686 --> 00:10:54,006
as well as for our

234
00:10:54,006 --> 00:10:57,026
So now that we got

235
00:10:57,666 --> 00:10:59,036
let's move onto something

236
00:10:59,036 --> 00:11:00,576
Let's make our first

237
00:10:59,036 --> 00:11:00,576
Let's make our first

238
00:11:01,096 --> 00:11:02,976
And we're going to take this

239
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:14,166
So, one thing to keep in mind

240
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:16,966
in three tiers, we've already

241
00:11:16,966 --> 00:11:18,296
that we want for

242
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:20,126
in default and default body.

243
00:11:20,426 --> 00:11:23,196
So with this third layer,

244
00:11:23,836 --> 00:11:26,316
all we're going to do is define

245
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:29,636
And we're going to do that in

246
00:11:30,736 --> 00:11:33,066
And inside of that you get to

247
00:11:33,066 --> 00:11:34,056
for the first character

248
00:11:34,476 --> 00:11:35,916
in the first paragraph

249
00:11:37,116 --> 00:11:38,346
And the interesting thing here,

250
00:11:38,686 --> 00:11:40,086
is this number of

251
00:11:40,636 --> 00:11:42,986
This is where you get

252
00:11:42,986 --> 00:11:44,526
of text your drop

253
00:11:45,726 --> 00:11:46,906
And as you can see

254
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:50,626
with a very simple

255
00:11:50,866 --> 00:11:51,796
So we made our style,

256
00:11:51,796 --> 00:11:54,066
but because there's no

257
00:11:54,066 --> 00:11:57,026
between this component textile

258
00:11:57,456 --> 00:11:58,216
we need to call it out.

259
00:11:59,356 --> 00:12:01,906
We do that by adding a textile

260
00:11:59,356 --> 00:12:01,906
We do that by adding a textile

261
00:12:02,466 --> 00:12:04,776
And naming the name of

262
00:12:04,776 --> 00:12:08,046
In this case it's called

263
00:12:08,266 --> 00:12:09,166
And once you do that,

264
00:12:09,376 --> 00:12:12,466
on the right you can see we

265
00:12:14,086 --> 00:12:16,666
So, stepping back, compared

266
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:19,146
at the beginning, now that

267
00:12:19,146 --> 00:12:20,056
things are looking a lot better.

268
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:21,366
But it's a bit jumbled.

269
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:23,176
We definitely need

270
00:12:23,496 --> 00:12:25,586
And this is where

271
00:12:26,786 --> 00:12:29,396
So, component layout is our

272
00:12:29,396 --> 00:12:29,826
we're adding.

273
00:12:30,706 --> 00:12:32,156
And inside we can

274
00:12:32,156 --> 00:12:34,146
which gives us the

275
00:12:34,146 --> 00:12:36,096
and bottom margins

276
00:12:36,616 --> 00:12:38,416
We also do a few more things,

277
00:12:39,946 --> 00:12:42,206
And we have flag component

278
00:12:42,646 --> 00:12:43,966
by adding a layout property.

279
00:12:44,516 --> 00:12:49,336
Once we do that, we've got some

280
00:12:49,836 --> 00:12:51,836
and topography, things

281
00:12:52,036 --> 00:12:55,796
But, let's take advantage of

282
00:12:55,866 --> 00:12:58,316
to add more control over

283
00:12:58,756 --> 00:12:59,526
Let's add a divider.

284
00:13:00,336 --> 00:13:02,346
And let's put it between

285
00:13:02,346 --> 00:13:06,026
and the title of the article.

286
00:13:06,026 --> 00:13:06,746
So, there's our divider.

287
00:13:07,216 --> 00:13:09,816
And you can see we have some

288
00:13:09,816 --> 00:13:11,426
We can change the

289
00:13:12,256 --> 00:13:14,276
But, personally what I

290
00:13:14,886 --> 00:13:16,356
here is what's happening

291
00:13:17,236 --> 00:13:18,386
So take a look at the divider

292
00:13:18,386 --> 00:13:20,416
and see how it extends

293
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:21,466
to the right side of the screen.

294
00:13:21,466 --> 00:13:24,076
This is nothing that's

295
00:13:24,606 --> 00:13:27,086
It's something that we're doing

296
00:13:27,466 --> 00:13:30,416
We're using a special property

297
00:13:31,226 --> 00:13:33,346
And you can see I've

298
00:13:33,926 --> 00:13:37,416
which means just

299
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:42,836
and go all the way to the edge.

300
00:13:42,996 --> 00:13:45,596
So now we've got

301
00:13:45,596 --> 00:13:47,246
we've got component

302
00:13:47,756 --> 00:13:49,556
Things are looking

303
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:51,116
you know, a text perspective.

304
00:13:52,066 --> 00:13:53,366
Now it's time to

305
00:13:54,456 --> 00:13:58,856
And, the best way to start

306
00:13:59,026 --> 00:14:00,086
So, got my photo component.

307
00:13:59,026 --> 00:14:00,086
So, got my photo component.

308
00:14:00,866 --> 00:14:02,506
Below that I added

309
00:14:02,906 --> 00:14:06,196
But, inside the footer

310
00:14:06,196 --> 00:14:09,416
you might see this caption

311
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:11,246
to be sort of replicating

312
00:14:11,776 --> 00:14:14,726
And what's really happening

313
00:14:14,726 --> 00:14:16,996
as it will appear if

314
00:14:16,996 --> 00:14:19,786
goes into full screen view,

315
00:14:21,366 --> 00:14:23,526
This is also a critical

316
00:14:23,526 --> 00:14:27,106
of accessibility, as the caption

317
00:14:27,106 --> 00:14:28,086
to VoiceOver users.

318
00:14:31,116 --> 00:14:33,406
Next, returning to our layout,

319
00:14:34,396 --> 00:14:36,146
you can see that this

320
00:14:36,146 --> 00:14:37,986
it's going all the way from

321
00:14:37,986 --> 00:14:38,886
to the right side of the screen.

322
00:14:39,046 --> 00:14:41,016
And again, this is not

323
00:14:41,016 --> 00:14:43,426
to the photo component,

324
00:14:43,426 --> 00:14:45,466
of the ignoreDocumentMargin

325
00:14:46,326 --> 00:14:48,636
This time though, instead

326
00:14:48,636 --> 00:14:49,626
I've given a value of true,

327
00:14:49,816 --> 00:14:51,766
which just means

328
00:14:52,306 --> 00:14:56,246
And then finally,

329
00:14:56,416 --> 00:14:57,746
which points to the image asset.

330
00:14:58,436 --> 00:15:00,906
And I'll step back and talk

331
00:14:58,436 --> 00:15:00,906
And I'll step back and talk

332
00:15:00,906 --> 00:15:02,926
for images that appear

333
00:15:02,926 --> 00:15:07,456
So images can be referenced

334
00:15:07,696 --> 00:15:10,746
just use the correct scheme.

335
00:15:10,956 --> 00:15:12,506
Again, just like

336
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:14,256
definitely send us

337
00:15:14,766 --> 00:15:16,976
We'll take care of down

338
00:15:17,546 --> 00:15:22,396
For images inside the article

339
00:15:22,396 --> 00:15:25,976
as well as GIF, and we

340
00:15:26,686 --> 00:15:30,456
So, that's photo.

341
00:15:30,456 --> 00:15:31,776
But what if you have

342
00:15:31,776 --> 00:15:33,376
that all go together

343
00:15:34,056 --> 00:15:36,746
This is where the gallery

344
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:38,886
And implementation

345
00:15:39,276 --> 00:15:41,106
You simply specify

346
00:15:41,996 --> 00:15:43,276
You feed it an array of images.

347
00:15:44,046 --> 00:15:45,816
And what you get is a

348
00:15:46,026 --> 00:15:47,166
where the user can engage

349
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:49,556
with the slide show

350
00:15:49,906 --> 00:15:51,846
They can tap, go to

351
00:15:52,256 --> 00:15:53,616
see the image specific captions.

352
00:15:54,506 --> 00:15:56,566
And when they're done, the

353
00:15:57,176 --> 00:16:02,796
Now, building on that we have an

354
00:15:57,176 --> 00:16:02,796
Now, building on that we have an

355
00:16:03,146 --> 00:16:04,296
called the mosaic gallery.

356
00:16:05,156 --> 00:16:06,886
And this has the

357
00:16:07,326 --> 00:16:09,426
except you switch the roll

358
00:16:09,966 --> 00:16:12,436
and what you get is this

359
00:16:13,086 --> 00:16:14,846
of your images that you

360
00:16:15,346 --> 00:16:18,156
And best of all, users

361
00:16:18,326 --> 00:16:21,396
into the gallery and get this

362
00:16:22,116 --> 00:16:25,676
Next, we have social

363
00:16:26,246 --> 00:16:27,806
Apple New Format has

364
00:16:27,806 --> 00:16:29,886
of these including

365
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:31,466
and as you can see here Twitter.

366
00:16:32,256 --> 00:16:35,046
And implementation is really

367
00:16:35,046 --> 00:16:36,846
of the thing that

368
00:16:37,406 --> 00:16:43,236
Next, getting into

369
00:16:43,276 --> 00:16:44,606
we have support for Apple Maps.

370
00:16:45,286 --> 00:16:48,756
And here's a really good example

371
00:16:48,756 --> 00:16:49,806
of the Apple Maps feature.

372
00:16:50,796 --> 00:16:52,896
Including one of these

373
00:16:52,896 --> 00:16:56,006
to show your user a location

374
00:16:56,006 --> 00:16:57,926
to get some context

375
00:16:58,106 --> 00:17:00,446
So if you're adding all

376
00:16:58,106 --> 00:17:00,446
So if you're adding all

377
00:17:00,446 --> 00:17:02,906
and interesting content, you

378
00:17:02,906 --> 00:17:05,366
to monetize your efforts and

379
00:17:05,606 --> 00:17:08,276
So let's just touch real

380
00:17:08,276 --> 00:17:10,665
that you can add ads into your

381
00:17:11,786 --> 00:17:15,016
So first if you need control,

382
00:17:15,106 --> 00:17:19,116
So you literally place these in

383
00:17:19,116 --> 00:17:20,336
where you think it

384
00:17:20,336 --> 00:17:21,126
to have an ad appear.

385
00:17:21,736 --> 00:17:24,175
If you don't need that

386
00:17:24,976 --> 00:17:27,806
the easier option is to use

387
00:17:28,476 --> 00:17:29,956
And with this, all

388
00:17:29,956 --> 00:17:32,876
to do is specify the frequency

389
00:17:32,876 --> 00:17:35,476
to appear, and the app will

390
00:17:36,296 --> 00:17:39,306
And so far what we have is a

391
00:17:39,306 --> 00:17:42,446
for the phone, but what happens

392
00:17:43,826 --> 00:17:46,086
So our mobile first

393
00:17:46,086 --> 00:17:48,646
has left us with a few

394
00:17:49,256 --> 00:17:53,246
We could be definitely making

395
00:17:54,476 --> 00:17:56,776
And this is kind of like a

396
00:17:56,776 --> 00:17:58,546
It would be nice to

397
00:17:58,546 --> 00:17:59,716
to keep our readers engaged.

398
00:18:01,086 --> 00:18:03,446
And, we have a really

399
00:18:03,866 --> 00:18:06,786
especially when you put the

400
00:18:07,946 --> 00:18:10,086
So the solution to all

401
00:18:10,086 --> 00:18:11,736
in the Apple News

402
00:18:12,486 --> 00:18:15,936
And this is really our

403
00:18:15,936 --> 00:18:18,666
of the digital age, which is how

404
00:18:19,566 --> 00:18:22,586
And of course there are

405
00:18:23,066 --> 00:18:24,546
Notably, responsive design,

406
00:18:25,036 --> 00:18:26,626
which you react to

407
00:18:27,636 --> 00:18:30,246
There's mobile first design, in

408
00:18:30,246 --> 00:18:31,296
as you gain more real estate.

409
00:18:31,876 --> 00:18:34,026
And these are both tried

410
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:37,596
but making them actually

411
00:18:37,596 --> 00:18:39,066
It's not easy.

412
00:18:39,066 --> 00:18:40,036
And sometimes you end

413
00:18:40,146 --> 00:18:42,816
up basically redesigning

414
00:18:42,866 --> 00:18:44,636
for different situations.

415
00:18:44,986 --> 00:18:47,296
And with Apple News

416
00:18:47,296 --> 00:18:48,476
to design your article once.

417
00:18:48,986 --> 00:18:51,486
But more than that,

418
00:18:51,486 --> 00:18:52,666
for the richest experience.

419
00:18:53,366 --> 00:18:55,626
We want you to focus on the

420
00:18:56,216 --> 00:18:59,126
And we don't want you to get

421
00:18:59,126 --> 00:19:02,926
and breakpoints because the app

422
00:18:59,126 --> 00:19:02,926
and breakpoints because the app

423
00:19:02,926 --> 00:19:04,106
that kind of scaling for you.

424
00:19:04,816 --> 00:19:07,706
So how does it work?

425
00:19:08,626 --> 00:19:11,596
Well, it starts with an iPad

426
00:19:12,366 --> 00:19:12,886
Then what we're going

427
00:19:12,886 --> 00:19:16,626
to as content creators is

428
00:19:17,206 --> 00:19:21,086
Now, here I've divided it into

429
00:19:21,086 --> 00:19:22,746
you get to choose how many

430
00:19:23,116 --> 00:19:25,206
There's no hard and

431
00:19:25,356 --> 00:19:28,416
just keep in mind the

432
00:19:29,086 --> 00:19:33,226
the more complexity you're

433
00:19:33,396 --> 00:19:35,736
So, once we've decided how

434
00:19:35,736 --> 00:19:37,596
for our article, next we have

435
00:19:37,716 --> 00:19:39,956
to assign some columns

436
00:19:41,256 --> 00:19:44,286
So, in this example

437
00:19:44,286 --> 00:19:47,946
of body content is consuming

438
00:19:49,306 --> 00:19:51,836
And the caption on the

439
00:19:51,836 --> 00:19:56,966
So then when we take that

440
00:19:56,966 --> 00:19:58,926
at it on different

441
00:19:59,296 --> 00:20:02,266
what we see is that the app

442
00:19:59,296 --> 00:20:02,266
what we see is that the app

443
00:20:02,266 --> 00:20:04,736
number of available columns

444
00:20:05,326 --> 00:20:07,576
And then likewise,

445
00:20:08,156 --> 00:20:12,696
is how intelligently

446
00:20:12,696 --> 00:20:15,456
to adapt the components to

447
00:20:16,286 --> 00:20:18,596
So as you can see like when

448
00:20:19,136 --> 00:20:21,546
things get narrower,

449
00:20:21,546 --> 00:20:22,566
where that wouldn't

450
00:20:23,336 --> 00:20:24,786
everything falls back

451
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:30,666
So at this point,

452
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:31,756
to start doing some arithmetic.

453
00:20:31,756 --> 00:20:34,286
Figuring out for such and

454
00:20:34,286 --> 00:20:38,836
and such layout, what

455
00:20:39,036 --> 00:20:40,916
That can get very complicated

456
00:20:41,526 --> 00:20:43,946
That's really not in the

457
00:20:44,226 --> 00:20:45,106
Because we want you to focus

458
00:20:45,106 --> 00:20:47,426
on the visual effects

459
00:20:48,356 --> 00:20:51,046
To help you do that, we

460
00:20:51,046 --> 00:20:51,706
News Preview.

461
00:20:52,436 --> 00:20:57,296
So as a designer, or developer,

462
00:20:57,296 --> 00:20:59,356
to iterate quickly in your

463
00:20:59,356 --> 00:21:00,206
and know they're

464
00:20:59,356 --> 00:21:00,206
and know they're

465
00:21:00,206 --> 00:21:02,006
And that's where News

466
00:21:02,006 --> 00:21:05,086
Because it allows you to

467
00:21:05,086 --> 00:21:06,346
on how your articles

468
00:21:07,386 --> 00:21:09,336
while you're messing

469
00:21:09,876 --> 00:21:12,516
And best of all it

470
00:21:12,716 --> 00:21:14,166
so you can see multiple devices,

471
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:16,756
multiple orientations

472
00:21:16,956 --> 00:21:18,096
simultaneously while you work.

473
00:21:19,366 --> 00:21:21,146
And it's available for

474
00:21:21,146 --> 00:21:24,586
at developer.apple.com.

475
00:21:25,076 --> 00:21:27,886
So, returning to our JSON,

476
00:21:27,886 --> 00:21:30,766
of the column system, now let's

477
00:21:30,766 --> 00:21:32,376
happen, in the article JSON.

478
00:21:32,376 --> 00:21:36,146
So now we're going to go

479
00:21:36,486 --> 00:21:36,956
we're going to look

480
00:21:36,956 --> 00:21:38,296
at a top-level property

481
00:21:38,936 --> 00:21:40,376
And this is your

482
00:21:40,786 --> 00:21:41,926
It's got four properties.

483
00:21:42,796 --> 00:21:45,296
And with these properties,

484
00:21:45,396 --> 00:21:49,146
for a given width, say 1024,

485
00:21:50,376 --> 00:21:53,086
I want to divide the

486
00:21:53,726 --> 00:21:54,896
with a 20-point gutter

487
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:57,346
And then to the left

488
00:21:57,346 --> 00:21:59,066
I'm going to have

489
00:21:59,066 --> 00:22:01,426
And of course these

490
00:21:59,066 --> 00:22:01,426
And of course these

491
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:03,476
this is what was

492
00:22:05,516 --> 00:22:07,676
Next, once we have

493
00:22:08,066 --> 00:22:09,846
now we need to start

494
00:22:09,846 --> 00:22:11,036
to our individual components.

495
00:22:11,646 --> 00:22:15,656
And, because of the very obvious

496
00:22:15,656 --> 00:22:17,896
we had with our body components,

497
00:22:18,646 --> 00:22:21,966
So, we see here on our

498
00:22:21,966 --> 00:22:23,766
we're using a layout

499
00:22:24,056 --> 00:22:25,486
So let's take a look

500
00:22:25,486 --> 00:22:29,116
And let's add two

501
00:22:29,896 --> 00:22:32,336
Our first new property

502
00:22:32,986 --> 00:22:35,866
And this simply says, going from

503
00:22:36,316 --> 00:22:38,816
what's the first column that

504
00:22:39,656 --> 00:22:41,346
I've chosen zero

505
00:22:41,796 --> 00:22:46,236
Then we have columnSpan, which

506
00:22:46,236 --> 00:22:49,256
to say how many columns in

507
00:22:50,096 --> 00:22:52,786
And I've set it to 10, which

508
00:22:52,786 --> 00:22:54,426
of columns in our document.

509
00:22:55,196 --> 00:22:56,436
And you probably won't

510
00:22:56,436 --> 00:22:57,776
that nothing changed

511
00:22:58,576 --> 00:23:01,766
The default is for all

512
00:22:58,576 --> 00:23:01,766
The default is for all

513
00:23:01,766 --> 00:23:03,186
to the full-width

514
00:23:04,636 --> 00:23:05,766
So let's make it

515
00:23:06,376 --> 00:23:09,906
Let's implement a centered

516
00:23:11,076 --> 00:23:12,346
That looks a lot better already.

517
00:23:13,126 --> 00:23:14,586
So, what's going on here?

518
00:23:15,706 --> 00:23:18,186
I've set it so that

519
00:23:18,186 --> 00:23:20,766
that our body content

520
00:23:21,186 --> 00:23:22,146
in our 10-column layout.

521
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:24,236
And of course if you start

522
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:26,096
from zero the third

523
00:23:26,456 --> 00:23:29,906
And then I've reduced

524
00:23:29,906 --> 00:23:32,016
so it only occupies six

525
00:23:32,626 --> 00:23:34,536
And that looks pretty good.

526
00:23:34,726 --> 00:23:38,836
But personally, I like a more

527
00:23:38,836 --> 00:23:42,026
to go ahead and kick it

528
00:23:42,026 --> 00:23:43,876
to occupy the first

529
00:23:43,876 --> 00:23:48,436
Now, if we take this

530
00:23:48,436 --> 00:23:49,466
to our other components,

531
00:23:50,426 --> 00:23:52,646
starting to see our design

532
00:23:53,646 --> 00:23:55,836
We switch the orientation

533
00:23:56,836 --> 00:23:58,686
And we've retained that

534
00:23:58,686 --> 00:24:01,176
that we had from the start.

535
00:23:58,686 --> 00:24:01,176
that we had from the start.

536
00:24:02,316 --> 00:24:05,186
So our one designed scaled

537
00:24:05,186 --> 00:24:06,406
A piece of cake.

538
00:24:06,406 --> 00:24:10,746
And now let's take that

539
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:12,846
So before we were talking

540
00:24:12,846 --> 00:24:14,616
of a long block of

541
00:24:14,616 --> 00:24:16,716
We can use some visual variety.

542
00:24:16,916 --> 00:24:18,266
And of course the

543
00:24:18,266 --> 00:24:20,116
to that problem is

544
00:24:20,676 --> 00:24:24,656
So let's extract some text

545
00:24:24,656 --> 00:24:26,496
and let's drop a pullquote in.

546
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:32,436
Next, let's use our component

547
00:24:32,436 --> 00:24:35,996
and just like push it

548
00:24:36,116 --> 00:24:38,616
So I chose a column start

549
00:24:38,876 --> 00:24:43,526
to allow the pullquote to

550
00:24:43,526 --> 00:24:46,396
And what you can see is

551
00:24:46,396 --> 00:24:48,206
and then it sort of floated

552
00:24:48,866 --> 00:24:50,276
which isn't quite the

553
00:24:51,076 --> 00:24:53,956
So what we need is we need

554
00:24:54,476 --> 00:24:56,426
between our pullquote

555
00:24:56,996 --> 00:24:59,496
And fortunately, we have an

556
00:25:00,016 --> 00:25:02,356
between the pullquote

557
00:25:02,356 --> 00:25:03,316
from which it was extracted.

558
00:25:03,846 --> 00:25:06,576
So, what we're going

559
00:25:06,576 --> 00:25:10,036
to use something called

560
00:25:10,396 --> 00:25:13,846
and we're going to anchor our

561
00:25:13,916 --> 00:25:15,766
that contains the

562
00:25:15,766 --> 00:25:16,676
out for the pullquote.

563
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:20,336
Step one in doing this is we're

564
00:25:20,336 --> 00:25:23,146
to our body component

565
00:25:23,696 --> 00:25:25,416
Then we're going to

566
00:25:25,916 --> 00:25:26,996
to our pullquote component.

567
00:25:27,426 --> 00:25:30,186
And inside of there, that's

568
00:25:30,186 --> 00:25:31,406
out the identifier we just made.

569
00:25:32,356 --> 00:25:34,856
And then we get to

570
00:25:34,856 --> 00:25:36,006
to align these two things.

571
00:25:36,666 --> 00:25:38,636
So in this case what

572
00:25:38,636 --> 00:25:41,976
to align the top of our

573
00:25:42,926 --> 00:25:45,386
to the top of our target,

574
00:25:47,036 --> 00:25:49,896
And once we do that, we

575
00:25:50,056 --> 00:25:51,796
We've got the pullquote

576
00:25:52,086 --> 00:25:54,026
right next to it the most

577
00:25:54,026 --> 00:25:54,596
that it could be near.

578
00:25:55,086 --> 00:25:57,126
We have much more

579
00:25:57,626 --> 00:26:00,656
But because we have an

580
00:25:57,626 --> 00:26:00,656
But because we have an

581
00:26:00,936 --> 00:26:02,066
between the pullquote

582
00:26:02,276 --> 00:26:03,586
from which it was extracted,

583
00:26:03,726 --> 00:26:05,816
we can actually take

584
00:26:06,546 --> 00:26:09,186
and actually anchor

585
00:26:09,596 --> 00:26:12,846
So this is going to

586
00:26:13,076 --> 00:26:16,146
First what we're going to do is

587
00:26:16,146 --> 00:26:18,306
and we're going to update it

588
00:26:18,306 --> 00:26:20,866
so that it overlaps the body

589
00:26:21,456 --> 00:26:24,766
And then we're going to

590
00:26:24,886 --> 00:26:26,606
from which the pullquote

591
00:26:27,926 --> 00:26:31,676
And once we do that, we get this

592
00:26:31,676 --> 00:26:33,936
into the text pullquote look.

593
00:26:35,036 --> 00:26:38,896
And then of course when

594
00:26:38,896 --> 00:26:39,886
on other orientations

595
00:26:39,886 --> 00:26:41,986
and devices it always

596
00:26:42,066 --> 00:26:45,586
whether it's reducing the width,

597
00:26:46,056 --> 00:26:47,896
falling back into a

598
00:26:48,776 --> 00:26:54,966
So, at this point, things

599
00:26:55,376 --> 00:26:57,956
We could probably call it

600
00:26:58,236 --> 00:26:59,636
as a template for our content.

601
00:27:00,116 --> 00:27:03,506
But if we look at the experience

602
00:27:03,506 --> 00:27:07,276
so far, it's kind of

603
00:27:08,586 --> 00:27:12,136
For instance, check out this

604
00:27:12,876 --> 00:27:15,926
Now, watch how the body

605
00:27:15,926 --> 00:27:17,306
up over the lead image.

606
00:27:17,596 --> 00:27:20,706
And how as you get to each

607
00:27:20,706 --> 00:27:21,646
as it gets to the view port.

608
00:27:22,806 --> 00:27:23,636
It's a really cool effect,

609
00:27:23,636 --> 00:27:25,456
so I think we can take

610
00:27:26,196 --> 00:27:28,216
So let's add some

611
00:27:28,216 --> 00:27:32,426
What we're going to do today is

612
00:27:32,426 --> 00:27:34,636
of a really cool Apple News

613
00:27:34,636 --> 00:27:35,346
scene animation.

614
00:27:35,346 --> 00:27:40,926
So, step one in doing this,

615
00:27:41,096 --> 00:27:41,906
and we're going to move it

616
00:27:41,906 --> 00:27:43,716
so that it's the first

617
00:27:43,716 --> 00:27:46,256
Now, next what we're

618
00:27:46,256 --> 00:27:47,606
to do a little transformation.

619
00:27:47,986 --> 00:27:49,426
We're going to take this photo.

620
00:27:49,426 --> 00:27:51,636
We're going to change it

621
00:27:52,086 --> 00:27:54,376
to being a background

622
00:27:55,926 --> 00:27:57,696
So to do that first, we're

623
00:27:57,966 --> 00:28:00,256
And we're using a semantic

624
00:27:57,966 --> 00:28:00,256
And we're using a semantic

625
00:28:00,256 --> 00:28:00,676
called header.

626
00:28:01,766 --> 00:28:03,366
Now, nothing actually changed

627
00:28:03,366 --> 00:28:04,766
because we just have an

628
00:28:04,926 --> 00:28:07,676
So for debugging purposes,

629
00:28:07,676 --> 00:28:09,916
and add some height and

630
00:28:10,106 --> 00:28:11,126
so we can see our container.

631
00:28:12,446 --> 00:28:14,056
There. Now we've got

632
00:28:14,986 --> 00:28:16,546
A few things to note

633
00:28:16,936 --> 00:28:19,076
First of all, I added

634
00:28:19,376 --> 00:28:21,176
with a new property

635
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:23,826
This allows us to find

636
00:28:24,616 --> 00:28:25,996
And component styles

637
00:28:26,026 --> 00:28:27,496
to some higher level

638
00:28:27,496 --> 00:28:30,576
like background fills

639
00:28:31,156 --> 00:28:34,146
The next interesting

640
00:28:34,146 --> 00:28:37,306
that it actually

641
00:28:37,476 --> 00:28:39,636
which is something I

642
00:28:40,256 --> 00:28:43,316
On a technical level,

643
00:28:43,316 --> 00:28:47,176
between defining things

644
00:28:47,376 --> 00:28:50,056
out elsewhere as

645
00:28:50,506 --> 00:28:53,186
It's really just a matter of

646
00:28:53,576 --> 00:28:55,746
And then we have our height.

647
00:28:56,406 --> 00:28:59,066
So I've manipulated the

648
00:28:59,226 --> 00:29:03,026
with a property called

649
00:28:59,226 --> 00:29:03,026
with a property called

650
00:29:03,026 --> 00:29:03,716
component layout.

651
00:29:04,936 --> 00:29:08,866
And I gave it a value of 44vmax.

652
00:29:09,016 --> 00:29:11,446
And what that means is we

653
00:29:11,446 --> 00:29:15,206
at least 44 percent of

654
00:29:16,306 --> 00:29:20,086
And this vmax unit is one of

655
00:29:20,086 --> 00:29:24,156
that are available

656
00:29:24,206 --> 00:29:28,266
So, now that we have our lovely

657
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:31,446
and switch it from

658
00:29:31,616 --> 00:29:32,706
to being an image fill.

659
00:29:33,736 --> 00:29:34,786
And doing this is

660
00:29:35,196 --> 00:29:38,296
We just add a fill

661
00:29:38,436 --> 00:29:42,216
And now that we have that,

662
00:29:42,286 --> 00:29:43,956
And we've completed

663
00:29:43,956 --> 00:29:46,096
we're a little be closer

664
00:29:46,746 --> 00:29:49,566
Next step, we need to

665
00:29:49,966 --> 00:29:52,236
And the way we're

666
00:29:52,236 --> 00:29:56,136
by actually dividing our entire

667
00:29:56,706 --> 00:29:58,336
semantic containers

668
00:29:59,846 --> 00:30:02,966
So our first section is

669
00:29:59,846 --> 00:30:02,966
So our first section is

670
00:30:02,966 --> 00:30:04,076
where the animation

671
00:30:04,206 --> 00:30:06,206
So I'm going to put our

672
00:30:06,626 --> 00:30:09,486
And then everything else in

673
00:30:09,486 --> 00:30:10,566
into our second section.

674
00:30:12,916 --> 00:30:14,546
Now to make our scene

675
00:30:14,886 --> 00:30:17,036
So, again, this is pretty easy.

676
00:30:17,036 --> 00:30:20,376
You simply add a scene

677
00:30:20,896 --> 00:30:23,376
And then you define what

678
00:30:23,956 --> 00:30:26,086
And here, I'm using one

679
00:30:26,736 --> 00:30:28,046
And what that means

680
00:30:28,046 --> 00:30:31,076
to take our header container,

681
00:30:31,076 --> 00:30:32,806
it's going to stick to

682
00:30:32,806 --> 00:30:35,256
the rest of the article is

683
00:30:35,256 --> 00:30:38,876
And then the background fill

684
00:30:39,056 --> 00:30:39,746
Let's see it in action.

685
00:30:40,976 --> 00:30:41,716
So here's our article.

686
00:30:42,046 --> 00:30:45,406
User scrolls, and the text

687
00:30:45,406 --> 00:30:46,296
and starts to fade away.

688
00:30:47,246 --> 00:30:48,896
That's the gist of the effect,

689
00:30:49,386 --> 00:30:51,566
but it's not quite

690
00:30:52,176 --> 00:30:55,016
We have that naked text

691
00:30:55,016 --> 00:30:55,896
and becoming illegible.

692
00:30:56,876 --> 00:30:57,756
Not the effect I want.

693
00:30:58,576 --> 00:31:00,416
Fortunately, the solution

694
00:30:58,576 --> 00:31:00,416
Fortunately, the solution

695
00:31:01,016 --> 00:31:02,976
All we need to do is

696
00:31:03,166 --> 00:31:04,056
to our second section.

697
00:31:04,056 --> 00:31:08,266
We're just going to let the

698
00:31:08,266 --> 00:31:10,016
that white background

699
00:31:10,506 --> 00:31:11,856
So again, let's see

700
00:31:12,526 --> 00:31:16,096
So we still get our animation

701
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:17,546
but it's still legible.

702
00:31:17,896 --> 00:31:18,976
Much better experience.

703
00:31:20,066 --> 00:31:22,096
So now that we've

704
00:31:22,886 --> 00:31:24,366
we need to pay a

705
00:31:24,366 --> 00:31:25,516
to some design elements.

706
00:31:25,996 --> 00:31:29,016
In our top of article experience

707
00:31:29,586 --> 00:31:33,906
And the first issue I'd

708
00:31:33,906 --> 00:31:35,456
that when we moved our photo,

709
00:31:36,006 --> 00:31:38,726
suddenly the captions got

710
00:31:38,726 --> 00:31:41,126
of things between it and

711
00:31:41,796 --> 00:31:44,676
And there are a few different

712
00:31:45,246 --> 00:31:47,846
The one I'm going to use today

713
00:31:48,636 --> 00:31:51,056
and sort of kick it

714
00:31:51,546 --> 00:31:55,046
So this has the effect of

715
00:31:55,046 --> 00:31:56,326
with a clean vertical line.

716
00:31:56,816 --> 00:31:59,186
But also, it makes our white

717
00:31:59,186 --> 00:31:59,516
up top.

718
00:32:00,186 --> 00:32:04,246
And then the next thing

719
00:32:04,246 --> 00:32:06,686
to take advantage of the fact

720
00:32:06,686 --> 00:32:08,746
with an image fill up top

721
00:32:08,746 --> 00:32:11,556
And one of the coolest

722
00:32:11,556 --> 00:32:13,076
to put things inside

723
00:32:13,366 --> 00:32:14,016
Mainly text.

724
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:16,706
Meaning we can layer some

725
00:32:17,246 --> 00:32:20,406
and add a much more interesting

726
00:32:22,936 --> 00:32:27,566
So, I've taken our title and the

727
00:32:27,566 --> 00:32:30,746
and I've put them into

728
00:32:32,196 --> 00:32:34,096
which looks pretty cool,

729
00:32:34,096 --> 00:32:35,166
of awkwardly floating up top.

730
00:32:35,506 --> 00:32:38,066
It'd be nice if I could align

731
00:32:38,066 --> 00:32:41,546
And I can, using another

732
00:32:42,836 --> 00:32:46,296
So if you use an anchor

733
00:32:46,296 --> 00:32:48,546
of a container, you get

734
00:32:48,546 --> 00:32:50,056
of it relative to its container.

735
00:32:50,666 --> 00:32:52,786
So in this case I'm using

736
00:32:52,786 --> 00:32:53,166
at bottom.

737
00:32:53,656 --> 00:32:56,596
And as you can see, my

738
00:32:56,596 --> 00:32:57,406
of the header container.

739
00:32:57,966 --> 00:33:02,586
And it looks a heck

740
00:32:57,966 --> 00:33:02,586
And it looks a heck

741
00:33:02,766 --> 00:33:04,306
So, we're really, really close.

742
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:07,436
We've got some interesting

743
00:33:07,436 --> 00:33:08,926
we've got nice white

744
00:33:08,926 --> 00:33:10,076
we've got good topography.

745
00:33:10,696 --> 00:33:12,786
The last thing I want to

746
00:33:12,786 --> 00:33:15,136
of article experience

747
00:33:15,136 --> 00:33:16,426
to add some inline text styles.

748
00:33:17,046 --> 00:33:20,466
So we're going to go one more

749
00:33:20,466 --> 00:33:22,916
And we're going to add a

750
00:33:22,916 --> 00:33:23,846
called textStyles.

751
00:33:24,696 --> 00:33:27,196
And textStyles is similar

752
00:33:27,746 --> 00:33:30,746
except that instead of styling

753
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:33,116
textStyles allows you to

754
00:33:33,116 --> 00:33:35,956
of text and make two styles.

755
00:33:37,026 --> 00:33:39,466
One for gray text,

756
00:33:40,066 --> 00:33:42,906
And to apply these I'm

757
00:33:42,906 --> 00:33:45,146
of a really cool

758
00:33:45,146 --> 00:33:45,956
in Apple News Format.

759
00:33:47,246 --> 00:33:49,526
So here's the two components

760
00:33:49,786 --> 00:33:52,596
We've got our title component

761
00:33:53,236 --> 00:33:59,266
And to apply my stiles, all I

762
00:33:59,266 --> 00:34:02,686
to effect in square

763
00:33:59,266 --> 00:34:02,686
to effect in square

764
00:34:02,686 --> 00:34:05,796
that with the style I want

765
00:34:07,236 --> 00:34:10,366
And once you do that, as you can

766
00:34:10,556 --> 00:34:14,136
I've given some gray text

767
00:34:15,005 --> 00:34:18,136
And then I've got a

768
00:34:18,346 --> 00:34:19,496
for our first body component.

769
00:34:20,196 --> 00:34:23,496
So, now I'm satisfied.

770
00:34:23,706 --> 00:34:26,346
Ready to call our top of

771
00:34:27,235 --> 00:34:29,335
There's just one more tweak I'd

772
00:34:29,335 --> 00:34:31,146
like to make before I call

773
00:34:31,146 --> 00:34:33,166
I want to add some

774
00:34:33,166 --> 00:34:34,216
that are further

775
00:34:34,636 --> 00:34:36,696
So, for instance the

776
00:34:37,186 --> 00:34:39,016
It'd be cool if that

777
00:34:40,646 --> 00:34:43,275
And it would also be cool

778
00:34:44,146 --> 00:34:46,056
But as for the mosaic

779
00:34:46,156 --> 00:34:48,416
I think it would be cool as

780
00:34:48,466 --> 00:34:49,426
to them in the viewport.

781
00:34:50,956 --> 00:34:52,856
So implementing this

782
00:34:53,646 --> 00:34:54,406
Here's our pullquote.

783
00:34:55,335 --> 00:34:59,066
And all I have to do to

784
00:34:59,066 --> 00:34:59,936
animation property.

785
00:35:00,826 --> 00:35:02,226
Inside I declare

786
00:35:02,226 --> 00:35:03,896
I want a move in

787
00:35:05,066 --> 00:35:07,236
With move in, I get to say from

788
00:35:07,236 --> 00:35:09,076
I'm going to have it

789
00:35:09,076 --> 00:35:11,936
Now, I'm going to

790
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:13,266
and apply it to our gallery.

791
00:35:13,266 --> 00:35:15,876
Then I'm going to add

792
00:35:15,876 --> 00:35:18,896
to the mosaic, and

793
00:35:19,116 --> 00:35:20,666
And let's see it

794
00:35:21,076 --> 00:35:23,196
So we've got our

795
00:35:23,686 --> 00:35:24,446
here comes the pullquote.

796
00:35:26,216 --> 00:35:29,306
Slide in. You can put

797
00:35:29,416 --> 00:35:30,386
caption, fade, fade.

798
00:35:31,466 --> 00:35:32,246
Looks a whole lot better.

799
00:35:33,216 --> 00:35:35,996
With just a few animations

800
00:35:35,996 --> 00:35:38,216
through the article more

801
00:35:39,146 --> 00:35:41,056
And that seems like a

802
00:35:41,646 --> 00:35:42,636
to end our crash course

803
00:35:42,636 --> 00:35:44,166
on the finer points

804
00:35:44,626 --> 00:35:46,206
So, we covered a lot.

805
00:35:46,546 --> 00:35:48,296
We added some text

806
00:35:48,426 --> 00:35:52,596
We saw how to make layouts

807
00:35:53,856 --> 00:35:56,026
We used anchoring to make

808
00:35:57,206 --> 00:35:58,116
And with just a few lines

809
00:35:58,116 --> 00:35:59,956
of code we added some

810
00:35:59,956 --> 00:36:03,166
Of course this is just the tip

811
00:35:59,956 --> 00:36:03,166
Of course this is just the tip

812
00:36:03,166 --> 00:36:04,946
to download the tools,

813
00:36:04,946 --> 00:36:06,026
and play around with

814
00:36:06,026 --> 00:36:09,286
We love to see what our

815
00:36:10,516 --> 00:36:10,976
Back to Casey.

&gt;&gt; Hey, Dan gave you

818
00:36:19,016 --> 00:36:20,176
to the Apple News Format

819
00:36:20,376 --> 00:36:22,446
and showed you how you can

820
00:36:22,446 --> 00:36:26,406
to create stories that are going

821
00:36:26,406 --> 00:36:30,396
I hope we've inspired you today

822
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:32,926
Check out the documentation,

823
00:36:32,926 --> 00:36:36,046
earn revenue, help writers

824

to plugins for the platform.

825
00:36:37,726 --> 00:36:40,456
This link will take you to

826
00:36:40,456 --> 00:36:42,466
in order to have those

827
00:36:42,466 --> 00:36:46,046
including your documentation

828
00:36:46,046 --> 00:36:47,386
that Dan showed you today.

829
00:36:48,286 --> 00:36:52,386
