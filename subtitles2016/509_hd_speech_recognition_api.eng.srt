2
00:00:19,786 --> 00:00:22,776
&gt;&gt; Hi. I'm Henry Mason,

3
00:00:22,776 --> 00:00:24,366
on speech recognition for Siri.

4
00:00:25,486 --> 00:00:28,306
Today we're incredibly excited

5
00:00:29,006 --> 00:00:31,376
which will let our speech

6
00:00:31,376 --> 00:00:32,386
for your apps too.

7
00:00:35,246 --> 00:00:37,636
A quick overview of what

8
00:00:38,286 --> 00:00:40,616
Speech recognition is

9
00:00:40,616 --> 00:00:43,486
of converting audio of

10
00:00:44,226 --> 00:00:46,276
It depends on the

11
00:00:46,536 --> 00:00:47,976
English will be recognized

12
00:00:47,976 --> 00:00:49,136
than Chinese, for example.

13
00:00:50,196 --> 00:00:52,346
On iOS, most people

14
00:00:52,506 --> 00:00:55,376
but speech recognition is also

15
00:00:56,456 --> 00:00:58,776
Since Siri was released

16
00:00:59,166 --> 00:01:01,606
iOS has also featured

17
00:00:59,166 --> 00:01:01,606
iOS has also featured

18
00:01:02,776 --> 00:01:04,176
That little microphone

19
00:01:04,176 --> 00:01:07,826
to your iOS keyboard spacebar

20
00:01:07,826 --> 00:01:10,076
for any UI kit text input.

21
00:01:11,116 --> 00:01:13,726
Tens of thousands of apps

22
00:01:14,266 --> 00:01:16,176
In fact, about a third

23
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:17,286
from third party apps.

24
00:01:18,356 --> 00:01:19,896
It's extremely easy to use.

25
00:01:20,236 --> 00:01:23,356
It handles audio recording

26
00:01:23,476 --> 00:01:25,216
It displays a user interface.

27
00:01:25,686 --> 00:01:28,106
It doesn't require you to write

28
00:01:28,106 --> 00:01:29,686
to support any text input.

29
00:01:30,666 --> 00:01:32,446
And it's been available

30
00:01:36,026 --> 00:01:38,326
But with its simplicity

31
00:01:40,116 --> 00:01:42,376
It often doesn't make sense

32
00:01:42,376 --> 00:01:43,576
to require a keyboard.

33
00:01:44,526 --> 00:01:47,146
You can't control when the

34
00:01:47,736 --> 00:01:49,876
There's no control over

35
00:01:49,996 --> 00:01:52,386
It just happens to use the

36
00:01:53,166 --> 00:01:54,506
There isn't even a way to know

37
00:01:54,506 --> 00:01:56,136
if the dictation

38
00:01:58,176 --> 00:02:00,596
The default audio recording

39
00:01:58,176 --> 00:02:00,596
The default audio recording

40
00:02:00,596 --> 00:02:03,596
for your use case and you

41
00:02:03,596 --> 00:02:06,726
than just text.

42
00:02:07,166 --> 00:02:09,186
So now in iOS 10,

43
00:02:09,186 --> 00:02:11,346
we're introducing a

44
00:02:14,286 --> 00:02:17,246
It uses the same underlying

45
00:02:17,296 --> 00:02:18,536
in Siri and Dictation.

46
00:02:19,576 --> 00:02:21,606
It provides fast

47
00:02:21,936 --> 00:02:24,166
which are transparently

48
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:26,596
without you having to

49
00:02:29,106 --> 00:02:31,576
The framework also

50
00:02:33,356 --> 00:02:35,136
about recognition

51
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:39,066
For example, we also provide

52
00:02:39,066 --> 00:02:41,666
of what your users might

53
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:42,866
and timing information.

54
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:46,316
Audio for the API

55
00:02:46,316 --> 00:02:47,856
from either pre-recorded files

56
00:02:47,966 --> 00:02:49,606
or a live source

57
00:02:52,086 --> 00:02:55,616
iOS 10 supports over 50

58
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,976
from Arabic to Vietnamese.

59
00:02:57,206 --> 00:03:01,256
Any device which runs

60
00:02:57,206 --> 00:03:01,256
Any device which runs

61
00:03:03,006 --> 00:03:06,326
The speech recognition API

62
00:03:06,326 --> 00:03:09,376
on our big servers which

63
00:03:10,296 --> 00:03:14,976
However, some newer devices do

64
00:03:14,976 --> 00:03:15,476
the time.

65
00:03:16,386 --> 00:03:18,906
We provide an availability

66
00:03:18,906 --> 00:03:21,506
if a given language is

67
00:03:21,506 --> 00:03:23,056
Use this rather than looking

68
00:03:23,056 --> 00:03:25,226
for internet connectivity

69
00:03:28,356 --> 00:03:30,856
Since speech recognition

70
00:03:30,856 --> 00:03:32,096
audio over the internet,

71
00:03:32,716 --> 00:03:34,796
the user must explicitly

72
00:03:34,796 --> 00:03:37,766
to your application before

73
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:42,196
There are four major steps

74
00:03:42,196 --> 00:03:44,206
to adopting speech

75
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,756
First, provide a

76
00:03:48,756 --> 00:03:50,116
in your app's info.plist.

77
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:54,636
For example, your

78
00:03:55,136 --> 00:03:57,306
might have used a

79
00:03:57,506 --> 00:04:01,536
for speech recognition

80
00:03:57,506 --> 00:04:01,536
for speech recognition

81
00:04:01,736 --> 00:04:03,936
to take a photo just

82
00:04:05,966 --> 00:04:09,546
Second, request authorization

83
00:04:09,546 --> 00:04:10,236
class method.

84
00:04:11,536 --> 00:04:14,146
The explanation you provided

85
00:04:14,426 --> 00:04:16,596
to the user in a

86
00:04:16,596 --> 00:04:19,346
And the user will be able

87
00:04:19,346 --> 00:04:21,495
to provide your app

88
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:25,336
Next create a speech

89
00:04:27,126 --> 00:04:29,156
If you already have

90
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:32,606
use the

91
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:33,086
class.

92
00:04:34,066 --> 00:04:34,946
Otherwise, you'll want

93
00:04:34,946 --> 00:04:38,476
to use the SFSpeechAudioBuffer

94
00:04:40,836 --> 00:04:42,806
Finally hand the

95
00:04:42,806 --> 00:04:45,446
to an SFSpeech recognizer

96
00:04:46,456 --> 00:04:49,066
You can optionally hold onto

97
00:04:49,336 --> 00:04:50,836
which can useful for monitoring

98
00:04:51,136 --> 00:04:52,856
and controlling recognition

99
00:04:56,356 --> 00:04:58,256
Let's see what this

100
00:04:59,286 --> 00:05:01,546
We'll assume we've already

101
00:04:59,286 --> 00:05:01,546
We'll assume we've already

102
00:05:01,546 --> 00:05:04,726
with an accurate description

103
00:05:05,066 --> 00:05:07,496
Our next step is to

104
00:05:08,486 --> 00:05:10,606
It may be a good idea

105
00:05:10,606 --> 00:05:12,886
until the user has invoked

106
00:05:12,886 --> 00:05:14,366
which depends on

107
00:05:14,866 --> 00:05:20,036
The request authorization class

108
00:05:20,036 --> 00:05:23,426
handler which doesn't guarantee

109
00:05:24,596 --> 00:05:26,976
Apps will typically want to

110
00:05:27,246 --> 00:05:29,046
if they're going to do

111
00:05:29,046 --> 00:05:31,006
or disable a user

112
00:05:33,636 --> 00:05:37,596
If your authorization handler

113
00:05:38,116 --> 00:05:39,896
you should be ready

114
00:05:41,646 --> 00:05:44,296
If not, recognition won't

115
00:05:45,586 --> 00:05:48,566
It's important to gracefully

116
00:05:48,646 --> 00:05:50,106
when the user makes

117
00:05:50,886 --> 00:05:52,946
or when the device is

118
00:05:52,946 --> 00:05:54,506
from accessing speech

119
00:05:55,496 --> 00:05:57,436
Authorization can

120
00:05:57,466 --> 00:05:59,156
in the device's privacy

121
00:06:01,286 --> 00:06:04,066
Let's see what it looks like

122
00:06:04,066 --> 00:06:04,796
audio file.

123
00:06:05,956 --> 00:06:07,946
We'll assume we already

124
00:06:09,886 --> 00:06:12,526
Recognition requires

125
00:06:12,716 --> 00:06:14,716
which only recognizes

126
00:06:15,536 --> 00:06:19,826
The default initializer for

127
00:06:20,336 --> 00:06:23,936
So it'll return nil if the

128
00:06:24,906 --> 00:06:27,726
The default initializer uses

129
00:06:29,866 --> 00:06:32,236
In this function, we'll just

130
00:06:34,586 --> 00:06:36,836
While this speech

131
00:06:37,016 --> 00:06:39,316
it may not be available,

132
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:40,846
to having no internet

133
00:06:41,966 --> 00:06:45,636
Use the is available property on

134
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:50,686
Now we create a recognition

135
00:06:50,686 --> 00:06:52,916
with the recorded

136
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:56,976
that to the recognition task

137
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:03,906
This method takes

138
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:06,366
with two optional

139
00:07:07,696 --> 00:07:10,706
If result is nil, that

140
00:07:10,706 --> 00:07:11,456
for some reason.

141
00:07:12,086 --> 00:07:14,106
Check the error parameter

142
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:18,896
Otherwise, we can read the

143
00:07:19,306 --> 00:07:20,356
by looking at results.

144
00:07:21,706 --> 00:07:24,916
Note that the completion handler

145
00:07:25,326 --> 00:07:27,136
as speech is recognized

146
00:07:28,256 --> 00:07:30,506
You can tell the

147
00:07:30,506 --> 00:07:33,746
by checking the is final

148
00:07:34,656 --> 00:07:37,386
Here we'll just print the

149
00:07:43,926 --> 00:07:46,876
Recognizing live audio from

150
00:07:46,876 --> 00:07:49,396
similar but requires

151
00:07:50,486 --> 00:07:53,176
We'll make an audio buffer

152
00:07:53,926 --> 00:07:55,486
This allows us to

153
00:07:55,486 --> 00:07:58,386
of in memory audio buffers

154
00:07:59,696 --> 00:08:03,316
Here we'll use AVAudioEngine to

155
00:07:59,696 --> 00:08:03,316
Here we'll use AVAudioEngine to

156
00:08:04,946 --> 00:08:06,306
Then append them to the request.

157
00:08:07,456 --> 00:08:09,896
Note that it's totally okay

158
00:08:09,896 --> 00:08:11,906
to a recognition

159
00:08:11,906 --> 00:08:13,376
and after starting recognition.

160
00:08:17,346 --> 00:08:20,596
One difference here is that

161
00:08:20,596 --> 00:08:22,616
value of the recognition

162
00:08:23,466 --> 00:08:25,616
Instead we store it in

163
00:08:26,366 --> 00:08:27,406
We'll see why in a moment.

164
00:08:28,626 --> 00:08:32,696
When we're done recording,

165
00:08:32,696 --> 00:08:35,775
that no more audio is coming so

166
00:08:37,025 --> 00:08:39,046
Use the end audio

167
00:08:39,846 --> 00:08:42,076
But what if the user

168
00:08:42,076 --> 00:08:43,885
or the audio recording

169
00:08:44,796 --> 00:08:47,236
In this case, we really

170
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:49,686
and we should free up any

171
00:08:49,686 --> 00:08:50,746
by speech recognition.

172
00:08:52,786 --> 00:08:54,996
Just cancel the recognition

173
00:08:55,196 --> 00:08:56,646
we stored when we

174
00:08:57,446 --> 00:08:59,856
This can also be done for

175
00:09:02,216 --> 00:09:04,516
Now just a quick talk

176
00:09:07,276 --> 00:09:10,676
We're making speech recognition

177
00:09:11,256 --> 00:09:13,166
but we do have some

178
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:15,306
so that the service remains

179
00:09:17,176 --> 00:09:19,426
Individual devices may

180
00:09:19,426 --> 00:09:21,416
of recognitions that can

181
00:09:23,046 --> 00:09:25,216
Apps may also be

182
00:09:25,216 --> 00:09:26,886
on a request per day basis.

183
00:09:28,606 --> 00:09:32,986
Like other service backed

184
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:36,586
be prepared to handle network

185
00:09:38,326 --> 00:09:39,806
If you find that you're

186
00:09:39,806 --> 00:09:41,566
throttling limits,

187
00:09:42,576 --> 00:09:45,876
It's also important to be aware

188
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:48,376
that speech recognition can

189
00:09:48,376 --> 00:09:50,196
of battery drain

190
00:09:52,336 --> 00:09:55,536
For iOS 10 we're starting with

191
00:09:55,536 --> 00:09:57,936
of about one minute

192
00:09:57,936 --> 00:09:58,976
of keyboard dictation.

193
00:10:02,506 --> 00:10:04,576
A few words about

194
00:10:04,576 --> 00:10:06,316
and respecting your

195
00:10:07,676 --> 00:10:10,316
If you're recording the user's

196
00:10:10,316 --> 00:10:12,696
to make this crystal clear

197
00:10:13,606 --> 00:10:16,706
Playing recording sounds and/or

198
00:10:16,706 --> 00:10:18,536
indicator makes it

199
00:10:18,756 --> 00:10:19,866
that they're being recorded.

200
00:10:22,186 --> 00:10:24,726
Some speech is a bad

201
00:10:25,556 --> 00:10:28,056
Passwords, health data,

202
00:10:28,056 --> 00:10:30,086
and other sensitive

203
00:10:30,086 --> 00:10:31,106
to speech recognition.

204
00:10:33,796 --> 00:10:36,396
Displaying speech as it

205
00:10:36,396 --> 00:10:39,516
and Dictation do can also help

206
00:10:39,516 --> 00:10:40,036
is doing.

207
00:10:40,966 --> 00:10:43,666
It can also be helpful for

208
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:45,146
when recognition errors occur.

209
00:10:47,896 --> 00:10:49,026
So developers.

210
00:10:49,456 --> 00:10:51,026
Your apps now have free access

211
00:10:51,026 --> 00:10:54,086
to high performance speech

212
00:10:54,996 --> 00:10:56,826
But it's important to

213
00:10:56,826 --> 00:10:57,756
where it's not available

214
00:10:57,756 --> 00:10:59,656
or the user doesn't

215
00:11:01,136 --> 00:11:02,966
Transparency is the best policy.

216
00:11:03,456 --> 00:11:04,396
Make it clear to the user

217
00:11:04,396 --> 00:11:06,246
when speech recognition

218
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:09,976
We're incredibly excited

219
00:11:09,976 --> 00:11:11,946

220
00:11:14,186 --> 00:11:16,416
