00:00:30,046 --> 00:00:30,606
&gt;&gt; Hello, everyone.

4
00:00:30,786 --> 00:00:32,456
Welcome to Building

5
00:00:33,036 --> 00:00:34,506
You are here because you care

6
00:00:34,586 --> 00:00:36,276
about building the

7
00:00:36,366 --> 00:00:38,146
for users of your fitness apps.

8
00:00:39,086 --> 00:00:40,216
Some of them are fanatical.

9
00:00:40,796 --> 00:00:42,816
They're spending hours

10
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:45,846
and they expect responsive,

11
00:00:46,196 --> 00:00:47,306
that provide accurate data

12
00:00:47,786 --> 00:00:50,006
and integrate seamlessly

13
00:00:51,286 --> 00:00:52,096
My name is Dash.

14
00:00:52,296 --> 00:00:54,276
I'm an engineer on Apple's

15
00:00:54,646 --> 00:00:56,336
and I'll be joined up

16
00:00:56,486 --> 00:00:57,436
by my colleague Jorge.

00:00:58,446 --> 00:01:01,366
Today, we're going to show you

Today, we're going to show you

19
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:02,706
that your users will love.

20
00:01:07,046 --> 00:01:09,476
Working out is an important

21
00:01:10,286 --> 00:01:13,106
It can help you sleep,

22
00:01:13,106 --> 00:01:13,926
and clear your mind.

23
00:01:20,356 --> 00:01:23,536
Many of you have worked hard

24
00:01:24,056 --> 00:01:26,656
that inspire users to track

25
00:01:27,106 --> 00:01:28,836
and reach for new

26
00:01:29,516 --> 00:01:33,686
With Apple Watch,

27
00:01:33,826 --> 00:01:36,016
within the moment heart

28
00:01:36,076 --> 00:01:37,266
and activity detection,

29
00:01:37,646 --> 00:01:40,366
in an experience delivered

30
00:01:41,646 --> 00:01:43,756
Today, we're going to

31
00:01:43,756 --> 00:01:46,886
to build great workout

32
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:51,506
We'll start by introducing

33
00:01:51,996 --> 00:01:55,936
a new game changing capability

34
00:01:57,356 --> 00:01:59,106
Then, we'll walk

35
00:01:59,106 --> 00:02:01,036
of a workout from

36
00:01:59,106 --> 00:02:01,036
of a workout from

37
00:02:01,576 --> 00:02:05,926
Along the way, we'll show

38
00:02:05,926 --> 00:02:07,756
contribute to the

39
00:02:10,036 --> 00:02:13,116
Next, we'll discuss some

40
00:02:13,146 --> 00:02:14,716
for workouts in iOS 10.

41
00:02:15,276 --> 00:02:19,006
And finally, we'll review

42
00:02:20,206 --> 00:02:20,996
So let's get started.

43
00:02:21,676 --> 00:02:26,296
At the core of every workout

44
00:02:26,366 --> 00:02:27,916
that the user can

45
00:02:28,566 --> 00:02:30,906
So we start with

46
00:02:32,146 --> 00:02:33,736
This API is simple to use

47
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:36,956
and provides automatic

48
00:02:37,526 --> 00:02:38,796
When a workout session

49
00:02:39,006 --> 00:02:41,586
the sensors on Apple Watch

50
00:02:41,716 --> 00:02:44,796
of the session to accurately

51
00:02:45,996 --> 00:02:48,266
This will also enable

52
00:02:48,266 --> 00:02:49,506
to the user's activity rings.

53
00:02:50,456 --> 00:02:52,256
For example, during a workout,

54
00:02:52,256 --> 00:02:55,786
activity will use the workout

55
00:02:55,836 --> 00:02:57,786
to the user's exercise ring.

56
00:02:59,496 --> 00:03:00,846
During a workout session,

57
00:02:59,496 --> 00:03:00,846
During a workout session,

58
00:03:01,046 --> 00:03:03,276
your app will be displayed

00:03:03,276 --> 00:03:03,876

60
00:03:04,556 --> 00:03:06,326
Users will love having

61
00:03:06,326 --> 00:03:08,266
to your app while they're

62
00:03:11,776 --> 00:03:15,466
Finally, we're really excited

63
00:03:15,466 --> 00:03:18,426
in watchOS 3 can now be set

64
00:03:19,686 --> 00:03:21,416

66
00:03:27,086 --> 00:03:29,126
Background running will

67
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:31,046
of your workout app.

68
00:03:31,046 --> 00:03:32,646
Your app will be

69
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:34,056
from the sensors

70
00:03:34,726 --> 00:03:36,716
For example, you'll be able

71
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:39,126
to receive continuous

72
00:03:39,126 --> 00:03:40,826
when your app isn't

73
00:03:40,826 --> 00:03:45,396
You'll also be able to provide

74
00:03:45,546 --> 00:03:47,576
at any time during

75
00:03:48,176 --> 00:03:49,746
You can send the

76
00:03:49,776 --> 00:03:51,286
to let them know their

77
00:03:53,616 --> 00:03:56,456
This will also allow

78
00:03:56,456 --> 00:03:58,926
up to date data whenever

79
00:03:58,926 --> 00:04:00,266

80
00:03:58,926 --> 00:04:00,266
at their wrist.

Enabling background

82
00:04:05,096 --> 00:04:08,636
just add workout-processing

in your extensions Info.plist.

84
00:04:14,046 --> 00:04:16,435
Of course, to maintain high

85
00:04:16,796 --> 00:04:18,456
it's critical that you

86
00:04:18,596 --> 00:04:19,935
to only do what's necessary.

87
00:04:20,005 --> 00:04:24,266
If your app uses excessive

88
00:04:24,796 --> 00:04:29,146
watchOS may decide

89
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:31,786
We recommend that

90
00:04:31,786 --> 00:04:34,026
to measure your app's

91
00:04:35,146 --> 00:04:37,576
You can use the CPU

92
00:04:39,016 --> 00:04:40,876
or the time profiler

93
00:04:42,436 --> 00:04:44,796
watchOS 3 will also

94
00:04:44,796 --> 00:04:48,166
with a backtrace whenever your

95
00:04:48,686 --> 00:04:52,516
Now that you're set up

96
00:04:52,986 --> 00:04:54,776
let's walk through the steps

97
00:04:56,436 --> 00:04:58,516
There are three steps

98
00:04:59,896 --> 00:05:02,286
First, you need to

99
00:04:59,896 --> 00:05:02,286
First, you need to

100
00:05:02,576 --> 00:05:06,726
to access data in HealthKit.

101
00:05:06,726 --> 00:05:08,876
Second, you'll create a

102
00:05:09,006 --> 00:05:12,896
representing the type of workout

103
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:14,336
And third, you'll create

104
00:05:14,336 --> 00:05:16,136
and start a workout

105
00:05:16,136 --> 00:05:17,006
workout configuration.

106
00:05:17,456 --> 00:05:18,876
Let's go through

107
00:05:23,046 --> 00:05:25,246
All workout apps will want

108
00:05:25,316 --> 00:05:26,656
to write workouts to HealthKit.

109
00:05:27,626 --> 00:05:29,856
This will enable workouts

110
00:05:29,856 --> 00:05:32,436
up in the user's health

111
00:05:33,236 --> 00:05:36,156
Depending on the specifics of

112
00:05:36,156 --> 00:05:38,486
to request authorization

113
00:05:38,646 --> 00:05:40,286
distance, and a heart rate.

114
00:05:41,256 --> 00:05:44,106
If you'd like more information

115
00:05:44,456 --> 00:05:46,576
we recommend you take a

Getting the Most

117
00:05:53,106 --> 00:05:54,436
Workout sessions are created

118
00:05:54,436 --> 00:05:56,076
with a workoutConfiguration

119
00:05:57,416 --> 00:06:00,266
The workoutConfiguration

120
00:05:57,416 --> 00:06:00,266
The workoutConfiguration

121
00:06:00,266 --> 00:06:01,996
type, such as running

122
00:06:02,766 --> 00:06:05,196
and the location type,

123
00:06:07,836 --> 00:06:09,766
You will use the

124
00:06:09,866 --> 00:06:13,836
to create a workoutSession,

125
00:06:14,056 --> 00:06:17,056
simply pass it to the start

126
00:06:21,076 --> 00:06:22,166
Let's try this out with a demo.

127
00:06:22,866 --> 00:06:25,256
For just today, let's pretend we

128
00:06:25,846 --> 00:06:28,576
Our latest project is

129
00:06:28,576 --> 00:06:32,166
for watchOS 3 that's designed

130
00:06:33,246 --> 00:06:34,196
It's called SpeedySloth.

131
00:06:35,096 --> 00:06:36,426
I've an Xcode project here

132
00:06:36,516 --> 00:06:39,746
that already has the UI

133
00:06:39,746 --> 00:06:40,616
Let's take a look together.

134
00:06:50,046 --> 00:06:51,866
So this is the first

135
00:06:51,976 --> 00:06:53,566
when they open our app.

136
00:06:53,566 --> 00:06:56,056
It has two pickers,

137
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:57,886
which can be walking,

138
00:06:59,006 --> 00:07:00,346
And another for location type,

139
00:06:59,006 --> 00:07:00,346
And another for location type,

140
00:07:00,556 --> 00:07:03,056
which can be outdoor,

141
00:07:03,566 --> 00:07:07,156
When I press the Start

142
00:07:07,546 --> 00:07:08,426
Let's fix that together.

143
00:07:12,046 --> 00:07:13,716
The view that you

144
00:07:14,026 --> 00:07:16,416
by a class called configuration

145
00:07:16,756 --> 00:07:20,356
I've a method right here

146
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:22,356
that's called whenever the

147
00:07:22,966 --> 00:07:23,666
I'll fill it in now.

148
00:07:28,196 --> 00:07:30,186
I'm creating a

149
00:07:30,976 --> 00:07:32,346
and I'm setting the

150
00:07:32,396 --> 00:07:34,196
to be the currently

151
00:07:34,476 --> 00:07:35,996
from that first picker.

152
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:38,496
Then I'm setting

153
00:07:39,706 --> 00:07:41,426
to be the currently

154
00:07:41,556 --> 00:07:42,376
from that second picker.

155
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:46,106
I'm passing the

156
00:07:46,576 --> 00:07:48,366
to a new interface

157
00:07:48,366 --> 00:07:49,516
WorkoutInterface Controller.

158
00:07:50,986 --> 00:07:52,906
WorkoutInterface

159
00:07:52,906 --> 00:07:54,976
for managing the UI

160
00:07:55,496 --> 00:07:57,586
It will also be responsible

161
00:07:57,586 --> 00:07:58,826
and stopping the

162
00:07:59,616 --> 00:08:01,276
Let's take a look at

163
00:07:59,616 --> 00:08:01,276
Let's take a look at

164
00:08:07,256 --> 00:08:09,736
So, I'm in the awake method of

165
00:08:10,076 --> 00:08:12,706
and I know that we'll receive

166
00:08:12,706 --> 00:08:14,396
as a context object

167
00:08:15,126 --> 00:08:16,556
Let's use it to start

168
00:08:20,306 --> 00:08:22,946
First, I'm unwrapping the

169
00:08:22,946 --> 00:08:24,456
that it's a valid

170
00:08:26,316 --> 00:08:29,136
Then I'm using it to create a

171
00:08:29,136 --> 00:08:30,976
to the initializer

172
00:08:34,046 --> 00:08:36,135
I'm setting the delegate of

173
00:08:36,346 --> 00:08:37,775
so we'll receive

174
00:08:37,775 --> 00:08:39,706
like state changes and errors.

175
00:08:42,176 --> 00:08:45,166
Then I'm saving the current date

176
00:08:45,506 --> 00:08:48,126
We'll use this later on, when

177
00:08:48,176 --> 00:08:48,946
to HealthKit.

178
00:08:51,556 --> 00:08:53,266
Next, I'm passing

179
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:54,926
to the start method

180
00:08:55,926 --> 00:08:56,546
Let's try it out.

181
00:09:11,046 --> 00:09:12,846
So here we are at configuration

182
00:09:12,936 --> 00:09:15,086
I'm going to leave it at

183
00:09:15,086 --> 00:09:16,136
to press the Start button again.

184
00:09:16,706 --> 00:09:20,636
So this just opened

185
00:09:20,936 --> 00:09:22,976
So I've a feeling, that our

186
00:09:22,976 --> 00:09:25,076
correctly, but to be

187
00:09:25,076 --> 00:09:26,206
at the clock face on the device.

188
00:09:27,536 --> 00:09:28,366
You'll see at the top,

189
00:09:28,366 --> 00:09:29,846
that there's a green

190
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:32,036
This indicates that

191
00:09:32,036 --> 00:09:34,476
on this watch has an

192
00:09:35,256 --> 00:09:38,376
The user can tap this at any

193
00:09:38,526 --> 00:09:39,406
with the active session.

194
00:09:39,966 --> 00:09:43,996
So it looks like our session

195
00:09:44,376 --> 00:09:45,356
Let's review what we just did.

196
00:09:46,206 --> 00:09:47,726
We used information

197
00:09:47,926 --> 00:09:49,716
to create a workoutConfiguration

198
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:53,436
Then we used that configuration

199
00:09:54,046 --> 00:09:55,826
And we started the

200
00:09:55,826 --> 00:09:57,246
to the start method

201
00:09:57,826 --> 00:10:00,926
Now that we have an

202
00:09:57,826 --> 00:10:00,926
Now that we have an

203
00:10:01,386 --> 00:10:03,406
we want to start collecting

204
00:10:03,406 --> 00:10:04,586
to the user during the workout.

205
00:10:05,526 --> 00:10:07,476
To talk to you more about

206
00:10:07,476 --> 00:10:09,246
I'd like to invite up

207
00:10:09,646 --> 00:10:09,936
Thank you.

208
00:10:10,516 --> 00:10:15,966
[ Applause ]

209
00:10:16,466 --> 00:10:17,946
&gt;&gt; Thank you Dash.

210
00:10:18,976 --> 00:10:19,486
Good morning.

211
00:10:20,506 --> 00:10:21,316
My name is Jorge.

212
00:10:21,396 --> 00:10:23,676
I'm a software engineer

213
00:10:24,446 --> 00:10:28,106
So, my colleague Dash just

214
00:10:28,106 --> 00:10:29,846
and start a workout session.

215
00:10:30,316 --> 00:10:32,046
Now, we are going to continue

216
00:10:32,046 --> 00:10:34,206
by discussing how

217
00:10:34,206 --> 00:10:37,966
and control the state of your

218
00:10:45,046 --> 00:10:47,076
We are going to be

219
00:10:47,136 --> 00:10:50,966
and control those different

220
00:10:51,146 --> 00:10:54,216
from the moment you

221
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:56,496
and until you decide to end it.

222
00:10:57,946 --> 00:10:59,816
Let's take a look at all

223
00:11:00,416 --> 00:11:06,126
First, we are going to be

224
00:11:06,196 --> 00:11:10,056
retrieving sample information

225
00:11:10,056 --> 00:11:12,826
to incorporate those

226
00:11:13,186 --> 00:11:17,806
Next, we are going to

227
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:23,126
Events can be generated by

228
00:11:23,126 --> 00:11:24,816
from your user interface.

229
00:11:25,196 --> 00:11:27,526
We're going to be discussing

230
00:11:27,526 --> 00:11:28,676
in detail later.

231
00:11:29,186 --> 00:11:34,286
Once you started

232
00:11:34,676 --> 00:11:36,346
you're in a running state.

233
00:11:37,106 --> 00:11:40,946
At any point, you

234
00:11:41,566 --> 00:11:44,306
and then resume the

235
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:49,066
And later, you will

236
00:11:49,346 --> 00:11:51,356
to end your workout session.

237
00:11:51,606 --> 00:11:53,866
So let's take a look

238
00:11:53,866 --> 00:11:56,436
at all these steps a

239
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:02,586
First, we said we wanted

240
00:12:02,846 --> 00:12:06,866
The way you do this is by

241
00:12:07,176 --> 00:12:10,156
for each of the data tabs

242
00:12:10,596 --> 00:12:13,526
That could be, maybe,

243
00:12:13,696 --> 00:12:16,046
or it could be active

244
00:12:16,566 --> 00:12:23,046
When you do this, you also will

245
00:12:23,046 --> 00:12:27,206
to receive new event, new

246
00:12:27,726 --> 00:12:34,926
That will allow you to keep

247
00:12:35,706 --> 00:12:38,716
such as maybe the total

248
00:12:38,826 --> 00:12:41,136
or total accumulated

249
00:12:41,616 --> 00:12:45,166
With that, you will be able

250
00:12:45,386 --> 00:12:49,246
You will also be able

251
00:12:49,556 --> 00:12:51,636
the most recent heart

252
00:12:56,046 --> 00:12:59,856
You could also notify users

253
00:12:59,986 --> 00:13:02,646
whenever they reach the

254
00:12:59,986 --> 00:13:02,646
whenever they reach the

255
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:05,896
or whenever they burn

256
00:13:05,896 --> 00:13:07,256
in their rowing workout.

257
00:13:07,256 --> 00:13:10,866
So let's now take a

258
00:13:14,046 --> 00:13:16,416
Since we are going to be

259
00:13:16,636 --> 00:13:18,936
the first thing that

260
00:13:18,936 --> 00:13:20,796
to create a predicate

261
00:13:21,336 --> 00:13:27,236
We are going to start by using

262
00:13:27,756 --> 00:13:32,026
You do not want samples that the

263
00:13:32,366 --> 00:13:34,786
to count against your totals.

264
00:13:35,126 --> 00:13:40,906
Next, you're going to

265
00:13:40,906 --> 00:13:42,126
from the local device.

266
00:13:42,286 --> 00:13:43,796
That means the current watch.

267
00:13:45,246 --> 00:13:48,626
You want to avoid, for

268
00:13:48,626 --> 00:13:52,136
that are being saved on

269
00:13:52,136 --> 00:13:54,106
of a sync operation

270
00:13:56,216 --> 00:13:59,136
Finally, you're going to

271
00:13:59,136 --> 00:14:03,176
into the final predicate you're

272
00:13:59,136 --> 00:14:03,176
into the final predicate you're

273
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:09,546
Next, you have to set

274
00:14:09,546 --> 00:14:12,326
to process samples

275
00:14:13,056 --> 00:14:17,026
You will normally accumulate

276
00:14:17,196 --> 00:14:21,416
and maybe display some

277
00:14:21,966 --> 00:14:26,536
Now, we are ready to create

278
00:14:26,906 --> 00:14:30,016
You're going to be using the

279
00:14:30,016 --> 00:14:31,866
in, the predicate we just built,

280
00:14:32,156 --> 00:14:34,456
and set up your initial

281
00:14:34,676 --> 00:14:36,346
as the handle we defined before.

282
00:14:36,886 --> 00:14:41,396
You will also set

283
00:14:42,086 --> 00:14:44,226
so you get new samples arriving

284
00:14:44,226 --> 00:14:46,046
to HealthKit during

285
00:14:47,996 --> 00:14:51,976
Finally, you're going to execute

286
00:14:58,076 --> 00:15:00,996
We also mention that you would

287
00:14:58,076 --> 00:15:00,996
We also mention that you would

288
00:15:00,996 --> 00:15:02,426
of certain reached goals.

289
00:15:02,616 --> 00:15:04,956
For example, whenever

290
00:15:04,956 --> 00:15:07,366
or the first 100

291
00:15:07,766 --> 00:15:10,436
The way you will normally do

292
00:15:10,436 --> 00:15:12,256
to alert the user

293
00:15:13,266 --> 00:15:15,266
When you do that, we recommend

294
00:15:15,356 --> 00:15:17,486
that you update your

295
00:15:17,756 --> 00:15:20,866
so you reflect what

296
00:15:21,246 --> 00:15:24,036
It is very likely when

297
00:15:24,816 --> 00:15:28,186
they will raise their wrist

298
00:15:28,186 --> 00:15:29,416
what this haptic was about.

299
00:15:29,896 --> 00:15:36,236
The way to play a haptic

300
00:15:36,456 --> 00:15:37,976
in WatchKit interface device.

301
00:15:42,216 --> 00:15:43,926
Now let's talk about events.

302
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:47,716
Events are timestamps

303
00:15:47,996 --> 00:15:50,476
to highlight certain

304
00:15:50,826 --> 00:15:53,886
For example, you can use

305
00:15:54,136 --> 00:15:56,976
to highlight the point where

306
00:16:02,046 --> 00:16:04,616
Some events are going to be

307
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:06,706
and saved later into

308
00:16:07,176 --> 00:16:12,476
Others are going to be created

309
00:16:15,116 --> 00:16:18,906
New in watchOS 3, we have

310
00:16:18,906 --> 00:16:23,206
in workout session delegate

311
00:16:23,446 --> 00:16:26,206
to send events to

312
00:16:27,816 --> 00:16:31,286
So let's now take a look at

313
00:16:31,286 --> 00:16:32,616
that we have in watchOS 3.

314
00:16:37,176 --> 00:16:41,036
Laps and markers are two new

315
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:47,136
These are events that you

316
00:16:47,446 --> 00:16:49,096
to store in your workout.

317
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:54,166
This will represent

318
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:57,246
for displaying your workouts

319
00:16:57,836 --> 00:17:03,476
There is a difference

320
00:16:57,836 --> 00:17:03,476
There is a difference

321
00:17:03,566 --> 00:17:08,976
Laps represent events that

322
00:17:08,976 --> 00:17:10,965
in equal distance portion.

323
00:17:11,536 --> 00:17:16,346
For example, if you're in a

324
00:17:16,346 --> 00:17:21,806
in a track, you would create

325
00:17:21,806 --> 00:17:22,906
completes a round.

326
00:17:26,996 --> 00:17:28,926
Markers, on the other side,

327
00:17:29,306 --> 00:17:32,176
can be arbitrary

328
00:17:32,896 --> 00:17:36,546
They don't have to be tied to

329
00:17:37,826 --> 00:17:39,476
They could represent,

330
00:17:39,926 --> 00:17:43,456
the moment your user

331
00:17:44,206 --> 00:17:48,346
or maybe that time where

332
00:17:55,046 --> 00:17:57,716
Now let's talk about pausing

333
00:17:58,026 --> 00:18:02,366
During a workout session,

334
00:17:58,026 --> 00:18:02,366
During a workout session,

335
00:18:02,366 --> 00:18:04,776
to momentarily stop

336
00:18:05,486 --> 00:18:10,156
For example, they are on a run,

337
00:18:10,156 --> 00:18:11,916
to buy a bottle of water.

338
00:18:12,456 --> 00:18:17,446
In this case, you will have

339
00:18:17,726 --> 00:18:19,956
for your user to let you

340
00:18:20,476 --> 00:18:24,396
When this happens, you can

341
00:18:24,796 --> 00:18:26,456
to pause your workout.

342
00:18:27,096 --> 00:18:30,686
This will allow HealthKit

343
00:18:30,896 --> 00:18:32,626
and space in the database.

344
00:18:33,136 --> 00:18:38,026
Of course, when this happens,

345
00:18:38,026 --> 00:18:40,186
that arrives to your

346
00:18:40,646 --> 00:18:44,046
You don't want to

347
00:18:44,046 --> 00:18:48,686
to your totals while

348
00:18:51,696 --> 00:18:55,396
HealthKit will respond

349
00:18:55,816 --> 00:18:58,386
by generating pause

350
00:18:58,636 --> 00:19:03,296
that you will get using the

351
00:18:58,636 --> 00:19:03,296
that you will get using the

352
00:19:03,796 --> 00:19:08,736
It's important to know that

353
00:19:09,316 --> 00:19:11,956
no new events will be

354
00:19:12,146 --> 00:19:14,556
until you resume your session.

355
00:19:19,546 --> 00:19:23,466
New in watchOS 3, the

356
00:19:23,466 --> 00:19:26,216
and resume your workout

357
00:19:26,606 --> 00:19:28,976
pause workoutSession and

358
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:34,826
Events that you will receive

359
00:19:35,336 --> 00:19:38,856
which you may already know

360
00:19:43,436 --> 00:19:45,386
Now let's talk about

361
00:19:46,756 --> 00:19:48,116
This is new in watchOS 3.

362
00:19:48,656 --> 00:19:51,196
The motion pause and

363
00:19:52,536 --> 00:19:56,986
Your watch, during a running

364
00:19:56,986 --> 00:19:59,596
that the user stopped moving.

365
00:19:59,596 --> 00:20:01,576
That means they are

366
00:19:59,596 --> 00:20:01,576
That means they are

367
00:20:02,446 --> 00:20:04,606
And we will be able to

368
00:20:04,606 --> 00:20:05,956
running again.

369
00:20:06,736 --> 00:20:12,566
When you receive these events,

370
00:20:12,746 --> 00:20:15,906
into your workout, the

371
00:20:16,456 --> 00:20:18,216
when the user manually paused.

372
00:20:18,816 --> 00:20:23,976
However, you do not need to

373
00:20:24,506 --> 00:20:28,566
Note that this is

374
00:20:28,566 --> 00:20:30,486
for the running activity type.

375
00:20:34,516 --> 00:20:38,316
So let's go back into our

376
00:20:38,446 --> 00:20:40,676
and see how we can

377
00:20:40,676 --> 00:20:42,716
of the concepts we

378
00:20:47,216 --> 00:20:51,326
So I'm going to be

379
00:20:53,026 --> 00:21:00,646
So to recap what we saw before,

380
00:20:53,026 --> 00:21:00,646
So to recap what we saw before,

381
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:04,136
which already started our

382
00:21:04,136 --> 00:21:07,936
on the screen that calories

383
00:21:08,506 --> 00:21:10,356
We are not accumulating

384
00:21:10,856 --> 00:21:16,116
So let's go into our workout

385
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:19,236
So going back to our workout

386
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:23,456
I'm going to be looking

387
00:21:23,456 --> 00:21:25,096
when decision changes it state.

388
00:21:25,456 --> 00:21:30,486
This is workoutSession

389
00:21:31,346 --> 00:21:35,286
Here I have switch statement

390
00:21:35,636 --> 00:21:38,486
What I'm interested in right

391
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:42,866
Whenever we came from a

392
00:21:42,866 --> 00:21:48,196
that the application

393
00:21:48,306 --> 00:21:51,206
So if you are in the running

394
00:21:51,506 --> 00:21:53,936
I'm going to be calling

395
00:21:53,936 --> 00:21:55,196
startAccumulating Data.

396
00:21:56,626 --> 00:21:58,086
So let's take a look

397
00:21:58,626 --> 00:22:03,496
What we want to do is to update

398
00:21:58,626 --> 00:22:03,496
What we want to do is to update

399
00:22:03,496 --> 00:22:05,706
on the screen, one

400
00:22:05,706 --> 00:22:09,146
and another one for

401
00:22:09,556 --> 00:22:12,786
So basically we are going to be

402
00:22:13,036 --> 00:22:14,816
of those two data types.

403
00:22:15,776 --> 00:22:19,356
The way you start the query

404
00:22:19,356 --> 00:22:20,216
the presentation.

405
00:22:21,296 --> 00:22:22,596
We first are going

406
00:22:22,596 --> 00:22:25,596
to be building a predicate

407
00:22:25,976 --> 00:22:30,396
Next, we are going to

408
00:22:30,856 --> 00:22:35,166
In this case, I already have

409
00:22:35,516 --> 00:22:38,436
that will grab those

410
00:22:38,626 --> 00:22:40,536
and update my user interface.

411
00:22:44,046 --> 00:22:47,086
Now, I'm ready to

412
00:22:47,856 --> 00:22:50,976
set up the updateHandler

413
00:22:53,436 --> 00:22:57,876
And finally, what I want to do

414
00:22:58,216 --> 00:23:02,506
Because a query executed

415
00:22:58,216 --> 00:23:02,506
Because a query executed

416
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:04,896
we want to stop it

417
00:23:06,916 --> 00:23:11,876
So let's now go and run

418
00:23:12,296 --> 00:23:15,806
Switch to the simulator.

419
00:23:21,376 --> 00:23:22,536
Okay. Here we are.

420
00:23:22,896 --> 00:23:25,076
So we are going to be

421
00:23:25,076 --> 00:23:27,836
a running outdoor workout.

422
00:23:28,996 --> 00:23:31,546
There it is.

423
00:23:32,956 --> 00:23:36,536
When we start, we can see

424
00:23:36,536 --> 00:23:38,716
that we see some numbers

425
00:23:38,926 --> 00:23:42,806
This is because the watch's

426
00:23:42,806 --> 00:23:46,196
fake samples for you whenever

427
00:23:47,436 --> 00:23:50,486
Great. So if you take

428
00:23:50,586 --> 00:23:51,856
we see there are

429
00:23:51,976 --> 00:23:54,016
but they are currently

430
00:23:54,756 --> 00:23:59,036
We already discussed how you can

431
00:23:59,476 --> 00:24:01,576
for your app, so

432
00:23:59,476 --> 00:24:01,576
for your app, so

433
00:24:01,576 --> 00:24:05,686
and see how we can do that.

434
00:24:05,886 --> 00:24:11,496
So here I have the didTapPause

435
00:24:11,676 --> 00:24:15,076
but it's hooked up to the

436
00:24:15,256 --> 00:24:17,166
so I'm going to be

437
00:24:17,676 --> 00:24:21,886
First I'm going to be checking

438
00:24:22,476 --> 00:24:24,716
and I'm going to be

439
00:24:25,286 --> 00:24:29,456
If it's running, I'm going to

440
00:24:29,906 --> 00:24:32,546
If it's paused, I'm

441
00:24:33,056 --> 00:24:35,846
Good. As a result of this,

442
00:24:36,086 --> 00:24:39,976
your workout session will change

443
00:24:44,046 --> 00:24:46,276
to the delegate callback,

444
00:24:46,546 --> 00:24:50,566
whenever your workout session

445
00:24:50,566 --> 00:24:54,096
you're going to see here that

446
00:24:54,626 --> 00:24:56,606
so we're going to be

447
00:24:56,606 --> 00:24:59,246
In this case I already

448
00:24:59,506 --> 00:25:02,456
pauseAccumulatingData,

449
00:24:59,506 --> 00:25:02,456
pauseAccumulatingData,

450
00:25:02,456 --> 00:25:05,226
that will basically stop

451
00:25:05,226 --> 00:25:07,596
as they arrive into the

452
00:25:08,896 --> 00:25:11,906
Similarly, we need to resume

453
00:25:12,266 --> 00:25:16,996
so whenever our session

454
00:25:16,996 --> 00:25:21,726
we're going to receive

455
00:25:22,196 --> 00:25:27,406
The other button that we have

456
00:25:27,406 --> 00:25:31,106
on the screen was

457
00:25:32,036 --> 00:25:34,246
In this case, what

458
00:25:34,246 --> 00:25:36,796
to do is create a markerEvent.

459
00:25:37,736 --> 00:25:39,556
We just create the workout event

460
00:25:39,556 --> 00:25:41,736
with a marker type

461
00:25:42,446 --> 00:25:45,926
We're going to be saving

462
00:25:46,306 --> 00:25:48,696
for later saving

463
00:25:49,196 --> 00:25:52,736
And finally, I have a step

464
00:25:52,736 --> 00:25:55,016
on the user interface.

465
00:25:55,016 --> 00:25:59,186
This event just happened.

466
00:25:59,186 --> 00:26:03,136
Also note that we already have

467
00:25:59,186 --> 00:26:03,136
Also note that we already have

468
00:26:03,646 --> 00:26:08,876
event that is a callback from

469
00:26:09,086 --> 00:26:14,216
In this case, we also want

470
00:26:14,216 --> 00:26:16,936
by HealthKit into the

471
00:26:16,936 --> 00:26:20,546
So let's now run our

472
00:26:28,226 --> 00:26:29,726
Give it a second

473
00:26:34,046 --> 00:26:34,546
Okay. Here it is.

474
00:26:34,726 --> 00:26:37,026
I'm going to choose

475
00:26:38,286 --> 00:26:39,336
And give it a few seconds

476
00:26:39,336 --> 00:26:41,296
so we can have some

477
00:26:42,216 --> 00:26:44,356
You can see at the top of

478
00:26:44,356 --> 00:26:45,836
that there is an active workout.

479
00:26:46,616 --> 00:26:50,746
Whenever I hit the Pause

480
00:26:50,946 --> 00:26:53,826
and you can see that the

481
00:26:53,826 --> 00:26:54,946
for calories and meters.

482
00:26:55,006 --> 00:26:57,686
I can probably resume

483
00:26:57,686 --> 00:27:01,646
It goes into active state, and

484
00:26:57,686 --> 00:27:01,646
It goes into active state, and

485
00:27:04,396 --> 00:27:08,416
You can also tap on

486
00:27:09,096 --> 00:27:11,676
which it basically displays

487
00:27:11,886 --> 00:27:16,156
It is very likely that an actual

488
00:27:16,156 --> 00:27:16,906
for your user.

489
00:27:20,046 --> 00:27:22,976
Great. So let's now switch

490
00:27:26,216 --> 00:27:27,536
So let's recap what we saw.

491
00:27:28,136 --> 00:27:33,486
We just saw how you can

492
00:27:33,946 --> 00:27:36,096
to get information

493
00:27:36,096 --> 00:27:38,426
and update your workout totals.

494
00:27:39,286 --> 00:27:42,776
Then we implemented

495
00:27:43,436 --> 00:27:47,266
in your workout application,

496
00:27:47,266 --> 00:27:50,676
to create an event

497
00:27:54,286 --> 00:27:57,006
Next step will be ending

498
00:27:57,316 --> 00:27:58,876
To talk about that, I'm going

499
00:27:58,876 --> 00:28:01,556
to invite my colleague

500
00:27:58,876 --> 00:28:01,556
to invite my colleague

[ Applause ]

502
00:28:09,266 --> 00:28:09,786
&gt;&gt; Hello again.

503
00:28:11,116 --> 00:28:12,846
Ending and saving a

504
00:28:13,566 --> 00:28:15,306
With a few steps, workouts saved

505
00:28:15,306 --> 00:28:17,406
from your app will

506
00:28:17,406 --> 00:28:19,566
with the activity

507
00:28:20,196 --> 00:28:21,926
Let's take a look at

508
00:28:26,046 --> 00:28:27,966
Workouts saved to HealthKit

509
00:28:27,966 --> 00:28:30,076
up in the activity

510
00:28:31,136 --> 00:28:32,296
Starting in iOS 10,

511
00:28:32,556 --> 00:28:34,786
this includes workouts

512
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:38,366
This means that a user can do a

513
00:28:38,476 --> 00:28:39,806
when their watch

514
00:28:40,126 --> 00:28:42,606
and they'll still get

515
00:28:43,516 --> 00:28:47,546
[ Applause ]

516
00:28:48,046 --> 00:28:49,896
Workouts saved with

517
00:28:49,896 --> 00:28:51,396
to contribute to

518
00:28:52,036 --> 00:28:54,806
Users will love getting credit

519
00:28:55,026 --> 00:28:56,596
in their activity day.

520
00:28:57,576 --> 00:29:00,206
Let's walk through the steps

521
00:28:57,576 --> 00:29:00,206
Let's walk through the steps

522
00:29:00,356 --> 00:29:02,886
so that it shows up in

523
00:29:03,716 --> 00:29:06,146
There are three steps

524
00:29:07,556 --> 00:29:09,526
First, you end the

525
00:29:12,266 --> 00:29:14,346
Second, you save the

526
00:29:15,596 --> 00:29:19,276
And third, you add related

527
00:29:19,386 --> 00:29:20,886
such as energy burned

528
00:29:21,876 --> 00:29:22,976
Let's go through

529
00:29:26,116 --> 00:29:28,686
To end the workout

530
00:29:29,046 --> 00:29:31,296
on your healthStore, and pass

531
00:29:32,026 --> 00:29:34,626
This will reset the devices

532
00:29:37,096 --> 00:29:38,966
When HealthKit finishes

533
00:29:38,966 --> 00:29:41,216
your workout session delegate

534
00:29:41,216 --> 00:29:42,276
in its state change method.

535
00:29:43,446 --> 00:29:45,426
When you see that the

536
00:29:45,586 --> 00:29:47,586
it's time to save the workout.

537
00:29:49,956 --> 00:29:52,836
You'll create an HKWorkout

538
00:29:53,716 --> 00:29:55,486
The information that

539
00:29:55,486 --> 00:29:58,826
with will be displayed in the

540
00:30:00,316 --> 00:30:02,866
Make sure to use the same

541
00:30:02,866 --> 00:30:03,986
on your workout configuration.

542
00:30:04,526 --> 00:30:08,096
Set a startDate and an

543
00:30:08,096 --> 00:30:10,876
and include an array

544
00:30:11,526 --> 00:30:13,946
This array can include events

545
00:30:14,286 --> 00:30:16,706
and markers or laps as

546
00:30:20,136 --> 00:30:22,656
The totalEnergyBurned

547
00:30:22,786 --> 00:30:23,876
that represents the sum

548
00:30:23,926 --> 00:30:27,566
of all energy burned

549
00:30:27,706 --> 00:30:30,516
Likewise, the totalDistance

550
00:30:30,546 --> 00:30:32,456
that represents all

551
00:30:32,456 --> 00:30:33,086
workout session.

552
00:30:36,086 --> 00:30:37,806
Finally, don't forget

553
00:30:39,136 --> 00:30:40,966
Set a value for the

554
00:30:41,106 --> 00:30:42,976
to indicate the location

555
00:30:47,166 --> 00:30:49,416
You can save this workout

556
00:30:49,416 --> 00:30:51,596
by passing it to the save

557
00:30:52,126 --> 00:30:54,946
When you see that it's

558
00:30:55,376 --> 00:30:57,006
it's time to add

559
00:30:57,316 --> 00:30:58,876
Let's talk more about

560
00:31:02,126 --> 00:31:03,676
When you add samples

561
00:31:03,926 --> 00:31:06,516
HealthKit creates an association

562
00:31:06,586 --> 00:31:07,596
and the workout itself.

563
00:31:08,156 --> 00:31:11,816
Apps will be able to query

564
00:31:11,816 --> 00:31:14,026
that are associated

565
00:31:14,616 --> 00:31:17,206
This will be useful if you

566
00:31:17,326 --> 00:31:18,546
across your workout timeline.

567
00:31:21,516 --> 00:31:24,346
Adding energy samples to

568
00:31:24,396 --> 00:31:25,716
if you want the user

569
00:31:25,716 --> 00:31:26,776
in their activity move ring.

570
00:31:27,466 --> 00:31:30,026
Activity will use these

571
00:31:30,086 --> 00:31:31,406
to compute credit for that ring.

572
00:31:37,046 --> 00:31:39,246
Finally, make sure that the

573
00:31:39,246 --> 00:31:41,406
on your workout sample

574
00:31:41,406 --> 00:31:42,816
of all these associated samples.

00:31:46,126 --> 00:31:48,506
To add samples to your

576
00:31:48,506 --> 00:31:50,426
of HK samples to the add samples

577
00:31:50,426 --> 00:31:52,046
to workout method

578
00:31:56,046 --> 00:31:57,916
Let's update SpeedySloth

579
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:58,796
and saving the workout.

580
00:32:00,376 --> 00:32:02,636
So when we were last in the

581
00:32:02,636 --> 00:32:04,196
to collect data to

582
00:32:05,056 --> 00:32:07,716
And also how to control the

583
00:32:08,616 --> 00:32:09,986
You may have noticed

584
00:32:09,986 --> 00:32:11,306
of the Workout Interface

585
00:32:11,626 --> 00:32:13,166
that there's this button

586
00:32:13,966 --> 00:32:15,406
When I tap it, it

587
00:32:16,026 --> 00:32:17,536
So we'll fix that now.

588
00:32:18,466 --> 00:32:20,366
I'm back in Workout

589
00:32:21,136 --> 00:32:23,236
and I have a method

590
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:24,856
Let's fill it in.

591
00:32:29,046 --> 00:32:31,616
First, I'm saving the current

592
00:32:31,876 --> 00:32:33,166
We'll use this in just a second

593
00:32:33,166 --> 00:32:34,346
when we create that

594
00:32:34,826 --> 00:32:39,726
Next, I'm calling the end

595
00:32:39,726 --> 00:32:41,296
and passing along

596
00:32:41,806 --> 00:32:44,946
When HealthKit finishes

597
00:32:45,166 --> 00:32:47,436
we can expect a callback

598
00:32:48,436 --> 00:32:49,896
I'll go back to this

599
00:32:54,046 --> 00:32:55,396
So Jorge showed us earlier,

600
00:32:55,396 --> 00:32:57,326
how to handle the

601
00:32:58,486 --> 00:33:00,126
Now we want to handle

602
00:32:58,486 --> 00:33:00,126
Now we want to handle

603
00:33:03,156 --> 00:33:05,706
We want to do two things when

604
00:33:06,216 --> 00:33:08,136
First, we want to

605
00:33:08,746 --> 00:33:12,146
This method is already

606
00:33:12,146 --> 00:33:14,836
over the array of open queries

607
00:33:17,046 --> 00:33:18,566
Next, we want to

608
00:33:18,886 --> 00:33:19,846
Let's implement that now.

609
00:33:27,086 --> 00:33:28,796
I'm creating a workout sample

610
00:33:28,796 --> 00:33:30,546
and I'm using the

611
00:33:30,546 --> 00:33:31,626
from our workout configuration.

612
00:33:32,126 --> 00:33:35,896
Then I'm setting the start

613
00:33:35,896 --> 00:33:36,996
that we saved earlier on.

614
00:33:37,636 --> 00:33:41,046
I'm including the

615
00:33:41,126 --> 00:33:42,186
that Jorge showed us how

616
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:43,626
to build during the

617
00:33:47,446 --> 00:33:49,426
I'm using the quantities

618
00:33:49,426 --> 00:33:51,716
and totalDistance

619
00:33:51,716 --> 00:33:53,296
from our data queries

620
00:33:53,826 --> 00:33:58,236
And finally, I'm including

621
00:33:58,456 --> 00:34:01,636
I'm setting the indoor workout

622
00:33:58,456 --> 00:34:01,636
I'm setting the indoor workout

623
00:34:01,636 --> 00:34:03,896
on the location type of

624
00:34:08,045 --> 00:34:09,916
I'm passing this workout

625
00:34:09,916 --> 00:34:11,606
on my healthStore, which

626
00:34:11,606 --> 00:34:15,136
When I see that it's

627
00:34:15,556 --> 00:34:17,505
I'm going to call

628
00:34:17,576 --> 00:34:19,666
which is a function right down

629
00:34:25,096 --> 00:34:27,025
I want to add two

630
00:34:27,386 --> 00:34:29,856
one for totalEnergyBurned,

631
00:34:33,136 --> 00:34:35,565
For totalEnergyBurned, I'm

632
00:34:36,176 --> 00:34:38,416
and I'm using the quantityType

633
00:34:40,016 --> 00:34:42,485
Then I'm passing the same

634
00:34:42,835 --> 00:34:44,335
that I used on my

635
00:34:45,156 --> 00:34:48,496
This means that there will be

636
00:34:48,496 --> 00:34:50,176
that spans the entire

637
00:34:51,045 --> 00:34:53,996
If you'd like to, you can create

638
00:34:53,996 --> 00:34:56,755
samples, just make sure that

639
00:34:56,755 --> 00:34:58,376
that you set on the

640
00:35:03,176 --> 00:35:05,176
I'm doing the same thing

641
00:35:06,406 --> 00:35:08,706
I'm using the quantity type

642
00:35:09,316 --> 00:35:11,026
HealthKit has three

643
00:35:11,256 --> 00:35:14,006
I'm using WalkingRunning because

644
00:35:14,006 --> 00:35:15,176
walking and running distance.

645
00:35:16,086 --> 00:35:18,066
If you're building a

646
00:35:18,066 --> 00:35:19,976
you'd want to use

647
00:35:20,576 --> 00:35:22,786
and we've also just added

648
00:35:22,936 --> 00:35:24,576
wheelchair distance,

649
00:35:24,576 --> 00:35:25,816
for wheelchair based workouts.

650
00:35:29,056 --> 00:35:31,416
I'm using the same total

651
00:35:31,416 --> 00:35:34,426
on the workout sample, and I'm

652
00:35:34,426 --> 00:35:34,926
and end date.

653
00:35:35,066 --> 00:35:36,806
So again, this is one

654
00:35:36,806 --> 00:35:37,976
that spans the duration

655
00:35:41,336 --> 00:35:44,176
I'm adding these two samples

656
00:35:44,176 --> 00:35:45,676
in an array to the add samples

657
00:35:45,676 --> 00:35:47,116
to workout method

658
00:35:47,676 --> 00:35:51,156
When I see that they've

659
00:35:51,476 --> 00:35:54,006
I know that all my data for this

660
00:35:54,906 --> 00:35:56,556
Now I want to display

661
00:36:00,086 --> 00:36:02,476
I'm doing this by passing

662
00:36:02,676 --> 00:36:04,206
to a new interface

663
00:36:04,206 --> 00:36:05,356
SummaryInterface Controller.

to display an HKWorkout to

666
00:36:11,686 --> 00:36:15,286
I'm going to run the app again,

667
00:36:15,476 --> 00:36:17,806
and we'll see how

668
00:36:33,086 --> 00:36:34,426
Let's do outdoor run again.

669
00:36:34,856 --> 00:36:35,516
I'll press Start.

670
00:36:36,146 --> 00:36:38,946
And we'll wait a few moments

671
00:36:45,046 --> 00:36:46,436
Okay I'm going to press

672
00:36:46,436 --> 00:36:49,666
because we have some data.

673
00:36:49,826 --> 00:36:51,076
Our workout session was ended

674
00:36:51,076 --> 00:36:52,786
and our sample was

675
00:36:53,196 --> 00:36:54,646
Here's the summary

676
00:36:54,646 --> 00:36:55,796
that workout sample to us now.

677
00:36:57,106 --> 00:36:59,756
To make sure that it did indeed

678
00:37:00,086 --> 00:37:02,306
let's take a look at the Health

I'm going to tap Show

of all of our workouts.

682
00:37:11,876 --> 00:37:15,096
At the top you can see a workout

683
00:37:15,096 --> 00:37:16,846
that was just completed

684
00:37:17,096 --> 00:37:17,746
That's our workout.

685
00:37:17,746 --> 00:37:21,046
I'm going to tap it to see

686
00:37:22,396 --> 00:37:24,736
So you can see that this

687
00:37:24,736 --> 00:37:26,596
It had an almost

688
00:37:26,936 --> 00:37:28,066
and there's our start

689
00:37:28,066 --> 00:37:30,056
This is all the information

690
00:37:30,576 --> 00:37:32,056
You can even see the

691
00:37:32,056 --> 00:37:33,476
that says it's not

At the bottom, you can

693
00:37:36,866 --> 00:37:38,216
that we associated

694
00:37:38,896 --> 00:37:40,986
We have almost two calories

695
00:37:41,206 --> 00:37:41,876
Good job everyone.

696
00:37:42,716 --> 00:37:45,626
And we have a 100th of a mile.

697
00:37:47,026 --> 00:37:49,576
So looks like everything did

698
00:37:50,356 --> 00:37:51,686
Let's review what we just did.

699
00:37:54,456 --> 00:37:57,506
We ended our workout session by

700
00:37:58,756 --> 00:38:00,126
And then we waited

701
00:37:58,756 --> 00:38:00,126
And then we waited

702
00:38:00,126 --> 00:38:01,616
in our state change

703
00:38:02,376 --> 00:38:04,196
When we saw that the

704
00:38:04,566 --> 00:38:06,706
we created a workout sample

705
00:38:07,826 --> 00:38:10,296
Then, we created two samples

706
00:38:10,646 --> 00:38:12,946
one for totalEnergyBurned,

707
00:38:13,766 --> 00:38:16,806
Remember associating that energy

708
00:38:16,806 --> 00:38:18,976
so that the user will get

709
00:38:22,046 --> 00:38:24,386
So we've just built an entire

710
00:38:24,726 --> 00:38:25,456
It's that simple.

Now every app on WatchOS comes

with a parent application

714
00:38:37,786 --> 00:38:39,446

in iOS 10 specifically

So you've been developing great

722
00:38:59,056 --> 00:39:04,556
So you've been developing great

723
00:39:05,226 --> 00:39:08,746
So workout apps are not

724
00:39:09,426 --> 00:39:11,046
Starting on iOS 10,

725
00:39:11,306 --> 00:39:14,596
we are providing some

726
00:39:14,596 --> 00:39:18,196
to implement new functionality

727
00:39:20,716 --> 00:39:25,736
We mentioned that every

728
00:39:25,736 --> 00:39:27,786
with a parent iPhone app.

729
00:39:28,966 --> 00:39:31,356
You can use that

730
00:39:31,666 --> 00:39:35,106
to build great experiences

731
00:39:35,636 --> 00:39:40,436
You might already be using

732
00:39:40,436 --> 00:39:41,816
between the two applications.

733
00:39:42,196 --> 00:39:43,646
This is an effective way

734
00:39:43,646 --> 00:39:47,806
of implementing features while

735
00:39:48,466 --> 00:39:50,046
and the application is running.

736
00:39:50,626 --> 00:39:54,386
Now we have background running,

737
00:39:54,606 --> 00:39:57,826
so your application can

738
00:39:58,086 --> 00:40:02,816
That allows you to implement

739
00:39:58,086 --> 00:40:02,816
That allows you to implement

740
00:40:03,346 --> 00:40:06,926
However, in order

741
00:40:07,286 --> 00:40:12,136
you need to have your

742
00:40:12,326 --> 00:40:16,856
So, starting with iOS 10,

743
00:40:17,166 --> 00:40:22,466
where you can start a

744
00:40:24,856 --> 00:40:29,196
That is, your watch will

745
00:40:29,456 --> 00:40:33,326
without the user having to

746
00:40:34,596 --> 00:40:37,176
So, let's take a look

747
00:40:39,806 --> 00:40:44,486
On your iPhone application, you

748
00:40:44,486 --> 00:40:46,656
and a location, and

749
00:40:46,656 --> 00:40:48,506
workoutConfiguration object.

750
00:40:49,996 --> 00:40:54,766
Once you have that, you send

751
00:40:54,766 --> 00:40:56,076
to the watch application.

752
00:40:56,766 --> 00:40:59,576
If the watch application

753
00:40:59,926 --> 00:41:00,976
it will be launched for you.

754
00:40:59,926 --> 00:41:00,976
it will be launched for you.

755
00:41:04,046 --> 00:41:08,946
Now, the workout application

756
00:41:09,106 --> 00:41:10,576
and start a workout session.

757
00:41:11,156 --> 00:41:15,296
In order for this to work,

758
00:41:15,526 --> 00:41:18,776
you need to have the workout

759
00:41:18,776 --> 00:41:20,536
mentioned earlier in

760
00:41:23,076 --> 00:41:26,616
So let's now take a

761
00:41:26,816 --> 00:41:28,586
You may be familiar

762
00:41:28,586 --> 00:41:30,786
because we saw it earlier

763
00:41:31,046 --> 00:41:33,076
This is what you do

764
00:41:33,076 --> 00:41:35,396
to start a workout

765
00:41:35,956 --> 00:41:39,916
You first create a

766
00:41:40,676 --> 00:41:44,986
and then use that to create a

767
00:41:45,516 --> 00:41:52,326
In this case, we want to

768
00:41:52,876 --> 00:41:56,756
The first part, creating

769
00:41:56,846 --> 00:41:59,056
will be executed on

770
00:41:59,996 --> 00:42:01,386
Creating a workoutSession

771
00:41:59,996 --> 00:42:01,386
Creating a workoutSession

772
00:42:01,446 --> 00:42:04,376
and start date will be

773
00:42:08,046 --> 00:42:09,896
For this to work, you need

774
00:42:09,896 --> 00:42:13,166
between the two applications,

775
00:42:13,166 --> 00:42:15,806
at the iPhone application code.

776
00:42:18,426 --> 00:42:21,786
First, you need to check

777
00:42:21,786 --> 00:42:23,456
if you have an activated

778
00:42:24,186 --> 00:42:26,806
and if you have a watch

779
00:42:27,256 --> 00:42:30,706
Once you do that, you're ready

780
00:42:30,706 --> 00:42:32,486
to create your

781
00:42:32,966 --> 00:42:37,886
Next, in order to pass

782
00:42:38,326 --> 00:42:41,496
to your watch application,

783
00:42:41,496 --> 00:42:44,356
in the new in iOS

784
00:42:44,406 --> 00:42:45,836
with workoutConfiguration,

785
00:42:46,246 --> 00:42:48,456
which is a new method

786
00:42:49,086 --> 00:42:52,366
This will grab your

787
00:42:52,366 --> 00:42:54,076
over to your watch app.

788
00:42:59,046 --> 00:43:01,026
So let's now look at the

789
00:42:59,046 --> 00:43:01,026
So let's now look at the

790
00:43:01,736 --> 00:43:04,526
What you want to do is grab

791
00:43:05,356 --> 00:43:08,566
to create a session

792
00:43:08,806 --> 00:43:13,766
For that, you will implement

793
00:43:14,216 --> 00:43:17,566
which is a new function,

794
00:43:17,566 --> 00:43:20,056
of WatchKit ExtensionDelegate.

795
00:43:20,796 --> 00:43:22,456
By implementing this function,

796
00:43:22,756 --> 00:43:24,436
you will grab your

797
00:43:24,436 --> 00:43:25,856
and are ready to start it.

798
00:43:27,516 --> 00:43:31,946
So, let's now go back into

799
00:43:32,356 --> 00:43:36,846
and see how we can

800
00:43:36,846 --> 00:43:37,976
from your iPhone.

801
00:43:45,046 --> 00:43:50,766
So, let's take a look

802
00:43:50,766 --> 00:43:52,346
I'm going to create

803
00:43:53,436 --> 00:43:55,896
And here I have the

804
00:43:55,896 --> 00:43:57,626
of our SpeedySloth application.

805
00:43:58,096 --> 00:43:59,206
So I'm going to launch it,

806
00:43:59,506 --> 00:44:02,716
and you see that the user

807
00:43:59,506 --> 00:44:02,716
and you see that the user

808
00:44:02,716 --> 00:44:05,426
to what we did on the watch.

809
00:44:05,676 --> 00:44:09,716
We have a user interface

810
00:44:09,716 --> 00:44:12,696
to select an Activity

811
00:44:12,696 --> 00:44:14,226
And then we have a Start button

812
00:44:14,226 --> 00:44:16,226
that is currently

813
00:44:17,446 --> 00:44:20,886
So let's take a look at our code

814
00:44:20,886 --> 00:44:24,146
and see how we can actually

815
00:44:25,586 --> 00:44:28,436
So I'm going to be

816
00:44:28,436 --> 00:44:30,406
for the iPhone application

817
00:44:30,756 --> 00:44:36,156
and I have configuration view

818
00:44:36,156 --> 00:44:38,096
that handles that

819
00:44:38,766 --> 00:44:40,276
In the didTapStart button,

820
00:44:40,946 --> 00:44:44,476
we're going to be

821
00:44:47,156 --> 00:44:48,466
First, we're going

822
00:44:48,466 --> 00:44:51,746
to be creating our

823
00:44:52,286 --> 00:44:54,416
with the selected activity

824
00:44:54,416 --> 00:45:00,586
This is the exact same code

825
00:44:54,416 --> 00:45:00,586
This is the exact same code

826
00:45:00,846 --> 00:45:02,136
Next, we are going

827
00:45:02,136 --> 00:45:05,066
to be grabbing our

828
00:45:05,316 --> 00:45:06,566
for our storyboard.

829
00:45:06,916 --> 00:45:08,786
This is the UI that we're going

830
00:45:08,786 --> 00:45:11,296
to show while the

831
00:45:11,876 --> 00:45:16,456
We are going to set the property

832
00:45:16,696 --> 00:45:19,696
in order to pass the

833
00:45:20,666 --> 00:45:24,946
And finally, we are going to be

834
00:45:24,946 --> 00:45:29,126
So let's take a look at

835
00:45:29,446 --> 00:45:31,876
and see what it is doing.

836
00:45:32,416 --> 00:45:37,286
On the viewDidLoad method,

837
00:45:37,286 --> 00:45:39,836
that we do is to

838
00:45:40,076 --> 00:45:43,636
This is basically grabbing

839
00:45:43,636 --> 00:45:45,176
and make sure it's initialized.

840
00:45:47,236 --> 00:45:51,586
Then, we are going to be calling

841
00:45:52,176 --> 00:45:59,446
The startWatchApp function

842
00:45:59,446 --> 00:46:01,526
that we have a valid

843
00:45:59,446 --> 00:46:01,526
that we have a valid

844
00:46:02,296 --> 00:46:04,716
that we have a valid

845
00:46:05,206 --> 00:46:08,436
and then this is the same code

846
00:46:08,696 --> 00:46:11,266
We first check that the

847
00:46:11,476 --> 00:46:14,356
activated and that we have

848
00:46:15,996 --> 00:46:19,586
Finally, we are going to be

849
00:46:19,586 --> 00:46:20,966
with workoutConfiguration.

850
00:46:22,236 --> 00:46:27,046
Great. So now we have to go

851
00:46:27,046 --> 00:46:30,816
to make sure that we grab that

852
00:46:31,326 --> 00:46:34,516
So, we are going to be

853
00:46:34,516 --> 00:46:38,706
into the ExtensionDelegate

854
00:46:40,176 --> 00:46:44,136
and using the same code to

855
00:46:44,716 --> 00:46:48,296
When we do that, we want to

856
00:46:48,406 --> 00:46:53,746
in a context object and pass to

857
00:46:53,746 --> 00:46:56,936
This is the same user interface

858
00:46:56,936 --> 00:46:59,886
that we were showing

859
00:46:59,886 --> 00:47:00,726
on the watch.

860
00:46:59,886 --> 00:47:00,726
on the watch.

861
00:47:04,126 --> 00:47:12,876
One other thing that we want

862
00:47:12,876 --> 00:47:17,826
to Workout InterfaceController,

863
00:47:18,316 --> 00:47:21,376
let me see -- whenever I said

864
00:47:21,376 --> 00:47:22,046
changes state.

865
00:47:22,386 --> 00:47:25,696
We're going to be calling

866
00:47:25,976 --> 00:47:29,076
This is something that we

867
00:47:29,076 --> 00:47:32,726
in our code, which is basically

868
00:47:32,726 --> 00:47:35,646
of the session, and send in

869
00:47:35,886 --> 00:47:37,686
to the iPhone application.

870
00:47:40,046 --> 00:47:43,906
So, let's now run our code

871
00:47:48,056 --> 00:47:48,946
and take a look.

872
00:47:54,186 --> 00:47:54,796
There it is.

873
00:47:54,966 --> 00:47:58,936
So we are going to be selecting

874
00:47:59,686 --> 00:48:01,016
When I press the Start button,

875
00:47:59,686 --> 00:48:01,016
When I press the Start button,

876
00:48:01,016 --> 00:48:03,016
you see the workout

877
00:48:03,016 --> 00:48:05,916
If you go back to

878
00:48:05,916 --> 00:48:08,796
you see that the app launch,

879
00:48:09,106 --> 00:48:12,056
Going back to the iPhone app,

880
00:48:12,056 --> 00:48:14,416
in running state,

881
00:48:14,416 --> 00:48:17,276
I can probably pause

882
00:48:18,436 --> 00:48:20,746
and you see that we updated

883
00:48:20,746 --> 00:48:25,206
And we can probably end

884
00:48:25,206 --> 00:48:28,916
of the workout also

885
00:48:29,516 --> 00:48:35,500
[ Applause ]

886
00:48:38,046 --> 00:48:43,226
So to recap, we just saw

887
00:48:43,226 --> 00:48:47,306
in your iPhone application,

888
00:48:47,606 --> 00:48:51,986
in a workout state, and at

889
00:48:51,986 --> 00:48:53,976
intervention needed

890
00:48:58,046 --> 00:49:01,166
So, let's now talk about some

891
00:48:58,046 --> 00:49:01,166
So, let's now talk about some

892
00:49:01,166 --> 00:49:05,306
to follow whenever you are

893
00:49:09,076 --> 00:49:12,136
The first is that we

894
00:49:12,386 --> 00:49:17,246
that your watch application is

895
00:49:17,246 --> 00:49:20,886
reach -- sorry, whenever

896
00:49:20,886 --> 00:49:21,946
from your iPhone.

897
00:49:23,796 --> 00:49:27,486
This is, for example,

898
00:49:27,996 --> 00:49:32,016
to start a running workout

899
00:49:32,016 --> 00:49:34,576
and go for a run, leave

900
00:49:35,746 --> 00:49:40,226
In that situation, we do not

901
00:49:44,046 --> 00:49:46,436
So, the first thing

902
00:49:46,436 --> 00:49:50,356
to keep your workout

903
00:49:51,016 --> 00:49:54,766
even when you lose

904
00:49:58,176 --> 00:50:00,986
Another interesting

905
00:49:58,176 --> 00:50:00,986
Another interesting

906
00:50:01,226 --> 00:50:03,456
is that you can use

907
00:50:03,836 --> 00:50:09,016
because HealthKit is able to

908
00:50:09,016 --> 00:50:11,476
when you don't have

909
00:50:16,406 --> 00:50:24,716
Also, we said that your

910
00:50:24,716 --> 00:50:28,186
from either their iPhone

911
00:50:29,556 --> 00:50:32,716
I would advise if you

912
00:50:33,226 --> 00:50:36,416
on which device they want

913
00:50:41,136 --> 00:50:45,236
Other advice involves

914
00:50:45,236 --> 00:50:46,506
historic workouts.

915
00:50:47,056 --> 00:50:51,386
If you do this, display

916
00:50:51,506 --> 00:50:53,426
not only your own app.

917
00:50:54,536 --> 00:50:57,286
We want you to show

918
00:50:57,436 --> 00:50:59,896
by other applications too.

919
00:51:02,156 --> 00:51:07,636
If you're doing so, don't forget

920
00:51:08,906 --> 00:51:11,716
You do not want to keep

921
00:51:11,896 --> 00:51:13,976
that were removed from

922
00:51:18,406 --> 00:51:22,586
So, to finalize today, there are

923
00:51:22,646 --> 00:51:24,596
to take from this presentation.

924
00:51:26,026 --> 00:51:28,506
First, we learned about

925
00:51:28,716 --> 00:51:34,216
which is a great way of

926
00:51:34,256 --> 00:51:40,616
constantly, and having your

927
00:51:44,566 --> 00:51:47,516
Second, you learned

928
00:51:47,616 --> 00:51:51,976
to your activity rings by

929
00:51:52,976 --> 00:51:56,956
either on your watch, or

930
00:52:00,186 --> 00:52:04,666
And finally, third, we learned

931
00:52:04,666 --> 00:52:07,996
from either your

932
00:52:08,566 --> 00:52:14,176
So we would like you to

933
00:52:14,806 --> 00:52:18,126
take a look at your code, and

934
00:52:18,306 --> 00:52:20,976
to implement some great

935
00:52:24,046 --> 00:52:26,136
For more information, you

936
00:52:26,436 --> 00:52:28,786
where you can see videos

937
00:52:29,076 --> 00:52:32,056
We have some related sessions.

938
00:52:32,056 --> 00:52:35,096
One from HealthKit and another

939
00:52:35,096 --> 00:52:37,626
If you missed them, you can

940
00:52:38,186 --> 00:52:40,066
And here are also

941
00:52:40,066 --> 00:52:42,926
from previous years

942
00:52:45,266 --> 00:52:46,206
This is all for today.

943
00:52:46,796 --> 00:52:47,636
Thank you very much.

944
00:52:47,966 --> 00:52:48,916
Enjoy the rest of your day.
