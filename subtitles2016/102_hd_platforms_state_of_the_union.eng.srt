&gt;&gt; Good afternoon.

00:00:27,556 --> 00:00:29,236
Welcome to WC 2016.

5
00:00:30,826 --> 00:00:33,006
Quite a bit has happened

6
00:00:33,006 --> 00:00:37,776
With the addition of tvOS, then

7
00:00:37,776 --> 00:00:39,336
a lot of them with

for their own unique

10
00:00:43,966 --> 00:00:47,246
But they share a tremendous

11
00:00:47,246 --> 00:00:49,506
and APIs, making it easy

12
00:00:49,506 --> 00:00:50,966
to all four platforms

00:00:51,396 --> 00:00:55,316

00:01:07,756 --> 00:01:11,446
And today we are announcing a

20
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:13,306
that you'll be able

21
00:01:13,856 --> 00:01:16,186
You'll find many more ways

22
00:01:16,436 --> 00:01:18,346
and you'll be able to

23
00:01:18,346 --> 00:01:19,266

covering everything from

Messages, Maps, and even Siri.

30
00:01:40,196 --> 00:01:43,586
An important concept that we use

31
00:01:43,626 --> 00:01:45,626
and you might remember that

32
00:01:45,626 --> 00:01:46,196

for creating iMessage Apps.

And to tell you all about it,

46
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:22,546

iMessage Apps are how you

Now, as Andreas mentioned,

52
00:02:42,546 --> 00:02:45,136
and that means that like other

in your apps on the App Store.

54
00:02:47,236 --> 00:02:50,006
But with iMessage Apps,

55
00:02:50,276 --> 00:02:52,286
You can include them in

56
00:02:52,546 --> 00:02:54,436
which you get at right

57
00:02:55,016 --> 00:02:57,846

Now, when you send interactive

you'll have the icon of

61
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:12,126
but even more importantly,

62
00:03:12,126 --> 00:03:15,716
that interactive message to

63
00:03:16,126 --> 00:03:19,156
they'll have this link that

64
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:20,646
If you tap on that link.

65
00:03:21,356 --> 00:03:23,566
That takes you right to

66
00:03:23,726 --> 00:03:27,536
so it's an amazing way to have

67
00:03:27,536 --> 00:03:29,186
from one person to another.

68
00:03:31,156 --> 00:03:32,966

69
00:03:33,106 --> 00:03:33,896
it's really simple.

70
00:03:33,896 --> 00:03:35,156
There's no coding required.

71
00:03:35,426 --> 00:03:37,836
You just take all of the

72
00:03:37,836 --> 00:03:39,506
for the app, the

73
00:03:39,746 --> 00:03:44,106

If you want to make a

75
00:03:48,006 --> 00:03:51,036
and take advantage of all

76
00:03:51,526 --> 00:03:54,986
you program with Swift

77
00:03:54,986 --> 00:03:56,166
like with other extensions.

to everything you need

So there's an object

83
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:08,706
that you send.

84
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:11,366
There's an object representing

85
00:04:11,366 --> 00:04:12,286
message is part of.

86
00:04:12,286 --> 00:04:14,296

and it's a really great way to

Now, all of this is done

that Messages is famous for.

91
00:04:28,776 --> 00:04:31,566
Your app doesn't have

92
00:04:31,566 --> 00:04:34,816
in the conversation outside of

93
00:04:35,236 --> 00:04:39,456
and if, it doesn't even

94
00:04:39,456 --> 00:04:44,886
who you're sending to, so that

Now, adaptive design

96
00:04:49,506 --> 00:04:51,246
to any iOS app development,

97
00:04:51,956 --> 00:04:54,616
and it's even more

98
00:04:54,686 --> 00:04:59,566
That's because Messages runs in

99
00:04:59,646 --> 00:05:01,886
and shapes of devices

100
00:04:59,646 --> 00:05:01,886
and shapes of devices

101
00:05:02,136 --> 00:05:05,886
And so it runs on iPad, it runs

102
00:05:05,886 --> 00:05:07,926
over an iPad, portrait

103
00:05:08,196 --> 00:05:10,916
and so your iMessage

104
00:05:11,196 --> 00:05:13,556
But there's one additional

105
00:05:13,616 --> 00:05:16,956
which is that they run in this

106
00:05:16,956 --> 00:05:18,836
of the screen where the

107
00:05:18,886 --> 00:05:21,616
between them or you

108
00:05:22,046 --> 00:05:24,086
and expand it to its full size.

109
00:05:24,086 --> 00:05:24,956
Sometimes the app will do it.

110
00:05:24,956 --> 00:05:26,406
Sometimes the user will do it.

112
00:05:28,586 --> 00:05:30,066

00:09:02,516 --> 00:09:03,126
Let's see.

192
00:09:05,026 --> 00:09:06,516
Okay, so here's the

193
00:09:06,516 --> 00:09:08,246
that creates the

194
00:09:08,516 --> 00:09:12,796
I'm going to drag in -- oops --

195
00:09:12,796 --> 00:09:15,816
This code looks to see

196
00:09:15,816 --> 00:09:17,856
if there's a selected

197
00:09:18,126 --> 00:09:19,696
That's what you get when

198
00:09:19,696 --> 00:09:21,456
and it launches the

199
00:09:21,766 --> 00:09:23,296
So if there is a

200
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:25,386
we'll use the session

201
00:09:25,516 --> 00:09:27,846
and if there isn't, we'll

202
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:33,636
So let's give that a try.

203
00:09:33,876 --> 00:09:38,186
Okay, so now we'll

204
00:09:38,496 --> 00:09:43,816
We'll tap the Plus button,

205
00:09:45,906 --> 00:09:53,986
add some toppings, send it back

206
00:09:55,756 --> 00:09:56,656
and send it back to Kate.

207
00:09:56,656 --> 00:10:00,426
So now you can see those

208
00:09:56,656 --> 00:10:00,426
So now you can see those

209
00:10:00,426 --> 00:10:01,536
earlier steps of the process,

210
00:10:01,536 --> 00:10:03,786
and you no longer have those

211
00:10:03,836 --> 00:10:05,036
sitting on top of

212
00:10:05,036 --> 00:10:07,606
And that is a little taste

213
00:10:07,606 --> 00:10:10,166
of what you can do

to people hundreds

00:10:31,346 --> 00:10:34,106
As of today, Siri is now

222
00:10:34,106 --> 00:10:37,776
of devices and in a

Siri also has many new features

between our hardware

00:11:03,646 --> 00:11:05,376
of SiriKit on iOS.

We believe the best

236
00:11:15,146 --> 00:11:17,966
to use the apps they love,

237
00:11:17,966 --> 00:11:20,666
and with SiriKit, people

238
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:23,086
with those applications in

239
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:26,246
I'm going to talk about how

240
00:11:26,246 --> 00:11:28,926
with SiriKit to provide a great,

241
00:11:29,576 --> 00:11:33,996
The first thing Siri does is

242
00:11:33,996 --> 00:11:36,036
taking audio and

243
00:11:37,156 --> 00:11:39,916
Then, Siri understands what the

244
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:41,996
and turning it into

245
00:11:43,366 --> 00:11:46,306
Based off that, on that

246
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:49,376
and provides responses,

247
00:11:50,586 --> 00:11:52,386
Your application will

248
00:11:53,006 --> 00:11:55,546
The first is vocabulary to

249
00:11:55,846 --> 00:11:58,266
The second is your app logic,

250
00:11:58,576 --> 00:12:00,616
and of course, a

251
00:11:58,576 --> 00:12:00,616
and of course, a

252
00:12:01,716 --> 00:12:04,736
Now, we designed SiriKit so that

253
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:06,776
and your application

254
00:12:07,306 --> 00:12:09,906
And what's great about that is

255
00:12:09,906 --> 00:12:13,006
to adopt SiriKit and your

256
00:12:13,006 --> 00:12:14,776
high-quality experience

257
00:12:15,126 --> 00:12:17,426
feels like a conversation

258
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:19,286
Let's dig in a bit.

259
00:12:20,336 --> 00:12:21,516
The first role of

260
00:12:21,516 --> 00:12:23,546
to provide vocabulary,

261
00:12:24,096 --> 00:12:25,466
The first is app vocabulary.

262
00:12:25,836 --> 00:12:27,136
These are terms that

263
00:12:27,136 --> 00:12:28,566
to any user of your application.

264
00:12:28,826 --> 00:12:30,246
Things like UberX or Pinboard.

265
00:12:30,896 --> 00:12:32,866
The other is user vocabulary.

266
00:12:33,306 --> 00:12:35,396
These are terms that are

267
00:12:35,396 --> 00:12:37,286
to an individual user

268
00:12:37,596 --> 00:12:39,836
Things like their contact

269
00:12:41,546 --> 00:12:43,036
The main role of

270
00:12:43,036 --> 00:12:44,956
to provide your app

271
00:12:45,046 --> 00:12:46,676
in an extension at

272
00:12:47,406 --> 00:12:49,566
The first is to help Siri

273
00:12:49,566 --> 00:12:50,306
of the user's intent.

274
00:12:50,796 --> 00:12:54,056
The second is to help Siri show

275
00:12:54,056 --> 00:12:55,196
and when they confirm

276
00:12:55,536 --> 00:12:58,036
And the third is to actually

277
00:12:58,426 --> 00:13:00,436
to accomplish what the

278
00:12:58,426 --> 00:13:00,436
to accomplish what the

279
00:13:01,956 --> 00:13:04,446
And during the conversation,

280
00:13:04,446 --> 00:13:06,806
to the user, and you can

281
00:13:06,806 --> 00:13:09,066
extension to customize

282
00:13:09,066 --> 00:13:10,636
with your application

283
00:13:10,636 --> 00:13:12,126
like using your application

284
00:13:13,716 --> 00:13:14,836
So let's take a look

285
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:16,826
at a messaging app

286
00:13:17,256 --> 00:13:19,706
Hologram is the number one

287
00:13:19,706 --> 00:13:21,316
in a galaxy far, far away.

288
00:13:21,316 --> 00:13:26,286
So imagine someone says

289
00:13:26,286 --> 00:13:28,246
to Obi-Wan saying,

290
00:13:29,646 --> 00:13:32,236
Now, it's Siri's job to

291
00:13:32,236 --> 00:13:34,896
into text, but Siri needs

292
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:37,296
Siri doesn't know on its own

293
00:13:37,296 --> 00:13:39,816
that Obi-Wan is an important

294
00:13:39,816 --> 00:13:42,186
in your user's life, and

295
00:13:42,186 --> 00:13:43,946
of vocabulary to

296
00:13:43,946 --> 00:13:45,596
that Siri understands

297
00:13:47,476 --> 00:13:50,206
Next, Siri works to understand

298
00:13:50,476 --> 00:13:52,466
In this case, send a

299
00:13:53,496 --> 00:13:55,396
And Siri will also work

300
00:13:55,706 --> 00:13:57,286
like the recipient

301
00:13:59,056 --> 00:14:00,386
Siri packages all

302
00:13:59,056 --> 00:14:00,386
Siri packages all

303
00:14:00,386 --> 00:14:03,396
into a structured object

304
00:14:04,006 --> 00:14:05,326
Your application

305
00:14:05,326 --> 00:14:07,996
about the countless ways someone

306
00:14:07,996 --> 00:14:09,876
to Siri, whether it be

307
00:14:10,056 --> 00:14:11,236
multi-step interactions.

308
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:13,156
All of that's handled

309
00:14:13,156 --> 00:14:14,906
about is this really

310
00:14:16,546 --> 00:14:19,116
SiriKit will then hand this

311
00:14:19,116 --> 00:14:20,416
with parameter resolution.

312
00:14:20,546 --> 00:14:22,326
For example, maybe

313
00:14:22,326 --> 00:14:24,556
that the user said "Obi-Wan,"

314
00:14:24,556 --> 00:14:25,716
to this person as

315
00:14:26,086 --> 00:14:27,986
and you can instruct

316
00:14:29,366 --> 00:14:30,766
Then comes the big event.

317
00:14:30,766 --> 00:14:32,646
It's time to actually

318
00:14:33,036 --> 00:14:34,896
and SiriKit will

319
00:14:34,896 --> 00:14:36,346
to your extension

320
00:14:36,486 --> 00:14:38,216
In this case, you're going to

321
00:14:38,216 --> 00:14:39,336
to get in an escape pod,

322
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:41,056
roll over some sand dunes,

323
00:14:41,056 --> 00:14:43,056
You're going to get the

324
00:14:44,736 --> 00:14:47,896
And along the way, Siri will

325
00:14:47,896 --> 00:14:49,146
for this interaction.

326
00:14:49,146 --> 00:14:52,066
And if you want, you can

327
00:14:52,066 --> 00:14:54,506
experience into Siri so

328
00:14:54,566 --> 00:14:55,266
to your users.

329
00:14:56,616 --> 00:14:57,616
And that's it.

330
00:14:57,616 --> 00:14:59,736
Those are the three things

331
00:14:59,736 --> 00:15:01,566
because SiriKit handles

332
00:14:59,736 --> 00:15:01,566
because SiriKit handles

333
00:15:02,906 --> 00:15:04,986
And handling the conversation

334
00:15:05,296 --> 00:15:06,686
Siri's behavior is

335
00:15:06,686 --> 00:15:09,146
on how someone starts a

336
00:15:09,486 --> 00:15:12,286
So if you're holding your

337
00:15:12,476 --> 00:15:13,276
looking at your screen,

338
00:15:13,736 --> 00:15:15,616
Siri will provide

339
00:15:15,716 --> 00:15:16,766
and say less things out loud.

340
00:15:17,186 --> 00:15:18,846

to show a lot more

say a lot more and

344
00:15:26,486 --> 00:15:29,856
SiriKit is powered by

345
00:15:30,066 --> 00:15:32,006
the same technologies that

346
00:15:32,006 --> 00:15:34,226
of OS integrations, and you'll

347

This year, SiriKit will connect

348
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:40,806
and in each of these

349
00:15:40,806 --> 00:15:42,506
than one intent to

350
00:15:42,506 --> 00:15:43,596
conversational experience.

351
00:15:43,926 --> 00:15:46,256
For example, in Messaging,

352
00:15:46,256 --> 00:15:48,026
or search them, and in Payments,

353
00:15:48,026 --> 00:15:49,886
you can request payment

354
00:15:51,286 --> 00:15:54,086
And SiriKit will be available

355
00:15:54,596 --> 00:15:57,136

I think to me, even better than

00:17:45,586 --> 00:17:48,386
We now have hundreds of new

that Swift being open is really

00:17:58,696 --> 00:17:59,826
to see it go everywhere.

401
00:18:00,656 --> 00:18:03,646
For example, we think that

402
00:18:03,946 --> 00:18:05,726

to push the language

We then debate these

of how fast Swift moves.

Despite its wide use, Swift

to quickly identify issues in

00:19:39,946 --> 00:19:42,486
because we don't want to be

We are building Swift as the

438

and so we want it to be great

439

So with that as context,

446
00:20:07,396 --> 00:20:10,636
let's dive into what's

447

of the language and

458
00:20:46,496 --> 00:20:48,056

459
00:20:48,426 --> 00:20:49,816
And there are a ton

460
00:20:49,816 --> 00:20:51,016
that you can see this in Swift.

461
00:20:51,936 --> 00:20:54,946
To give you a simple

462
00:20:54,946 --> 00:20:58,036
about Swift 2 is that

463
00:20:58,036 --> 00:21:00,036
in Cocoa didn't feel

464
00:20:58,036 --> 00:21:00,036
in Cocoa didn't feel

You could say they're

468
00:21:11,296 --> 00:21:13,986
Now, we did this with a number

469
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:17,146
First, we sat down

470
00:21:17,146 --> 00:21:21,146
about what really makes a great

471
00:21:21,146 --> 00:21:24,086
down in a document that's

472
00:21:25,336 --> 00:21:28,266
We then took that and took

473
00:21:28,266 --> 00:21:31,436
into the Swift recompiler, so

474
00:21:31,556 --> 00:21:35,146
to Objective-C APIs as it

475
00:21:36,366 --> 00:21:38,586

476
00:21:38,586 --> 00:21:39,856
Naming's a pretty

477
00:21:40,116 --> 00:21:41,446
but it goes beyond just naming.

you'll find entirely new

572
00:25:52,046 --> 00:25:55,006
over the course of the

on your own with a set

with just text input and output

Swift Playgrounds makes it easy

600
00:27:01,336 --> 00:27:03,206
so let's take a look

601
00:27:03,206 --> 00:27:05,896
that I created earlier and

602
00:27:06,626 --> 00:27:11,236
Now, I started here with

603
00:27:11,536 --> 00:27:14,036
and you can see the

604
00:27:14,036 --> 00:27:14,946
over there on the right.

605
00:27:15,636 --> 00:27:17,836
So just some squares

606
00:27:17,836 --> 00:27:19,876
and colors rotated

607
00:27:20,796 --> 00:27:24,236
Now, everything over on

608
00:27:24,236 --> 00:27:25,886
of my code on the left.

609
00:27:25,886 --> 00:27:30,576
At the heart of my code

610
00:27:31,056 --> 00:27:33,496
That's where I create

611
00:27:34,306 --> 00:27:36,936
And then up at the very

612
00:27:36,936 --> 00:27:39,906
that defines how many

613
00:27:40,426 --> 00:27:44,266
Well, right now, that's set to

614
00:27:44,266 --> 00:27:47,426
that entire right-hand side

615
00:27:47,846 --> 00:27:50,736
so to do that, let me just

616
00:27:51,736 --> 00:27:52,756
and then I'll tap Run.

617
00:27:54,116 --> 00:27:59,576
Nice. And I think maybe instead

618
00:28:01,316 --> 00:28:02,236
That looks good.

619
00:28:02,696 --> 00:28:05,456
And I really like the pattern

620
00:28:05,456 --> 00:28:07,286
where the squares,

621
00:28:07,286 --> 00:28:08,746
down into the center

622
00:28:09,096 --> 00:28:10,336
That looks really cool.

623
00:28:10,726 --> 00:28:12,896
I bet I could make

624
00:28:13,156 --> 00:28:16,526
if I change the size of those

625
00:28:16,526 --> 00:28:17,176
over time.

626
00:28:17,786 --> 00:28:22,286
So back down in the for loop

627
00:28:22,756 --> 00:28:24,216
I'm going to tap on the plus

628
00:28:24,316 --> 00:28:26,066
between these two

629
00:28:27,206 --> 00:28:28,756
Rather than just

630
00:28:29,276 --> 00:28:30,536
why don't I try multiplication?

631
00:28:31,796 --> 00:28:34,356
Run that. That looks good.

632
00:28:35,166 --> 00:28:38,426
So you can start to get an

633
00:28:38,426 --> 00:28:42,486
to explore and experiment

634
00:28:44,006 --> 00:28:46,296
So next, I'd like to

635
00:28:46,296 --> 00:28:47,746
of life to my picture.

636
00:28:48,296 --> 00:28:51,086
I'll use some animation

637
00:28:51,296 --> 00:28:54,006
Now, to do that, I'm going

638
00:28:54,006 --> 00:28:55,406
in to the Shapes template,

639
00:28:56,606 --> 00:29:02,156
and I think what I want is I

640

and I think what I want is I

641
00:29:02,156 --> 00:29:03,826
in from the center

642
00:29:04,886 --> 00:29:08,436
So I'm going to tap right here

643
00:29:08,876 --> 00:29:11,716
and then down in the shortcuts

644
00:29:11,716 --> 00:29:13,736
and I'm going to tap on

645
00:29:14,976 --> 00:29:18,316
So I'll have an animation

646
00:29:18,316 --> 00:29:22,776
and I'll have it wait for just

647
00:29:23,356 --> 00:29:26,476
and then everything that I put

648
00:29:26,476 --> 00:29:30,296
It's going to be automatically

649
00:29:30,296 --> 00:29:32,306
to pull in the rotation

650
00:29:32,566 --> 00:29:36,446
And then I also want the size

651
00:29:36,756 --> 00:29:40,776
so I think I'll start it out

652
00:29:41,566 --> 00:29:43,646
and then back in

653
00:29:43,826 --> 00:29:45,236
I'll set it to what

654
00:29:46,806 --> 00:29:51,816
So I'll say square.size

655
00:29:52,496 --> 00:29:55,526

This extension works

to enable transformations,

of the image to show the hiking

902
00:41:44,816 --> 00:41:45,986
to do it on wider displays.

1258

1259

to do is identify

across applications,

1284

when your application

And finally, we've

1288
00:59:36,746 --> 00:59:39,496
so you can capture very rich

1289
00:59:39,796 --> 00:59:41,816
and have those be

1290
00:59:42,066 --> 00:59:44,496
when you ship your application

1292
00:59:49,166 --> 00:59:52,956
We have rewritten the console

1293
00:59:52,956 --> 00:59:53,646

1294
00:59:53,646 --> 00:59:56,036

I thought you guys

1319
01:01:04,156 --> 01:01:05,016
or the crowd might be excited.

1320

Now, the Apple File

from our smallest device, the

1322

with very large storage

It's also modern.

1324
01:01:14,656 --> 01:01:16,746
We designed it first

1325

and tomorrow's storage

1326
01:01:19,586 --> 01:01:22,486
It's resilient and we've

1327
01:01:22,486 --> 01:01:25,976
to unify encryption

1328
01:01:26,156 --> 01:01:28,466
which gives us great

1329
01:01:29,476 --> 01:01:32,456
Now, the Apple File System has a

and I want to highlight

The first is called cloning.

1332
01:01:37,316 --> 01:01:38,096
Now, why cloning?

1333
01:01:38,626 --> 01:01:40,686
It turns out that if you look

1334
01:01:40,756 --> 01:01:43,726
for a while, you'll find many

1335
01:01:43,726 --> 01:01:45,796
It's kind of human nature

1336
01:01:46,166 --> 01:01:47,936
That's of course inefficient.

1337
01:01:48,186 --> 01:01:49,356
It uses up storage space.

1338
01:01:50,016 --> 01:01:53,136
But with clones, you're able

1339
01:01:53,136 --> 01:01:56,106
for that initial storage when

1340
01:01:56,776 --> 01:01:59,816
It's very fast and you can

1341
01:02:00,126 --> 01:02:01,106
and directory hierarchies.

1342
01:02:02,416 --> 01:02:03,596

01:02:24,176 --> 01:02:24,886
in the classroom.

they may inadvertently modify

1358
01:02:37,926 --> 01:02:39,716
and what you can do is you

So how do we do this using

Well, first, each of you

1393

01:04:13,996 --> 01:04:16,456
of the survey, through

1395
01:04:16,706 --> 01:04:18,176
we add noise to each answer.

1396
01:04:18,326 --> 01:04:20,756
And after we've added noise,

1397
01:04:20,756 --> 01:04:21,996
to know what you

of our deep links a unique

1418

on their device, whenever

1419
01:05:18,506 --> 01:05:21,826
we take that hash, add noise

1420
01:05:21,826 --> 01:05:23,506
of it, and send it to Apple.

1421
01:05:24,166 --> 01:05:25,516
Now, any one of these fragments

1422
01:05:25,666 --> 01:05:27,446
on their own is completely

1423

but when we aggregate this

1424
01:05:31,586 --> 01:05:34,546
we're able to recover the

1425
01:05:34,806 --> 01:05:37,866
and then use that to

1426

and improve our user's

1427
01:05:40,476 --> 01:05:44,966
That is the science behind

1428
01:05:45,256 --> 01:05:47,486
There's one more aspect of it

1429
01:05:48,096 --> 01:05:51,656
You might think, well, if we're

1430
01:05:51,796 --> 01:05:54,426
and this works by capturing

1431
01:05:54,836 --> 01:05:58,596
what happens if Apple captures

1432
01:05:58,746 --> 01:06:00,866
Could you not then

1433
01:05:58,746 --> 01:06:00,866
Could you not then

1434
01:06:01,516 --> 01:06:03,846
And this is where the

1435

The privacy budget limits

1436
01:06:06,996 --> 01:06:09,956
that we can capture from any

1437
01:06:09,956 --> 01:06:12,166
that in the end, we can

1438
01:06:12,166 --> 01:06:14,236
information from any

1439
01:06:15,396 --> 01:06:16,936
So that is differential privacy.

1482
01:08:31,506 --> 01:08:33,316
to a whole ton of functionality.

1483
01:08:34,196 --> 01:08:38,036
It's how your application tells

1484
01:08:38,036 --> 01:08:40,086
in your app, and that allows us

1485
01:08:40,086 --> 01:08:43,095
to create intelligent

1486

And in iOS 10, we're adding two

1488
01:08:51,446 --> 01:08:55,136
Now, many apps use addresses

1489
01:08:55,486 --> 01:08:57,666
and we can use that

1490
01:08:57,876 --> 01:08:59,466
between your applications.

1492
01:09:03,796 --> 01:09:05,185

with this address on it.

1496
01:09:14,136 --> 01:09:15,515
That would allow me to do things

01:09:23,506 --> 01:09:25,656
and it can make it

1500
01:09:25,656 --> 01:09:28,566
to order a ride directly

1501

Or when I'm typing in a text

1502
01:09:33,595 --> 01:09:37,666

at and Maps can include that in

1504
01:09:42,866 --> 01:09:45,895
with a quick way of getting

1505
01:09:48,095 --> 01:09:51,116
Now, we also interact with

1506
01:09:51,116 --> 01:09:54,966
and the OS can learn which

1507
01:09:55,086 --> 01:09:56,276
with any given person.

1508
01:09:57,196 --> 01:09:58,856
To do this, your app needs

1509
01:09:58,856 --> 01:10:00,726
to give us three

that you'll use for this person.

Now, this is the new

in here information that we

we can take you straight

I should point out that all

and embedding it directly

Or you could encrypt your

1563
01:12:55,926 --> 01:12:59,276
about is making these

I'm going to tell you

1567
01:13:02,436 --> 01:13:05,176
to get this functionality

1568
01:13:06,136 --> 01:13:09,346
The first thing you want to do

1569
01:13:09,346 --> 01:13:11,206
and support the new compact size

1570
01:13:11,206 --> 01:13:12,926
so that your widget

Okay, let's switch gears

in places where that

1581
01:13:49,166 --> 01:13:52,446
The Mac now joins

1582
01:13:52,446 --> 01:13:56,156
which quietly introduced support

And with so many potential

And with so many potential

1585
01:14:01,126 --> 01:14:03,826
it's really more important

1586
01:14:03,996 --> 01:14:07,376
that your app be properly

1587

where he was going.

AppKit will take care of pretty

1594
01:14:29,906 --> 01:14:32,656
and it's smart enough not to

1595
01:14:32,656 --> 01:14:35,686
with your document windows,

1596
01:14:36,236 --> 01:14:38,256
And in fact, if you're

1597
01:14:38,256 --> 01:14:40,856
there really is nothing

1598
01:14:40,856 --> 01:14:42,176
to do in your application.

1599
01:14:43,216 --> 01:14:45,956
If you're not using

1600
01:14:45,956 --> 01:14:48,776
of API you need to adopt to

1601
01:14:49,246 --> 01:14:51,106
but I'd really encourage

1602
01:14:51,106 --> 01:14:54,696
at whether NSDocument isn't

1603
01:14:55,896 --> 01:14:59,476

1607

that this is the

in terms of file

on three key qualities

01:17:58,066 --> 01:18:00,416
The first is that

1660
01:17:58,066 --> 01:18:00,416
The first is that

1661
01:18:01,246 --> 01:18:03,916
Individual interactions

1662
01:18:04,456 --> 01:18:06,486
so it's important to

1663
01:18:06,716 --> 01:18:09,506
simple information to

1664
01:18:09,506 --> 01:18:13,316
on what's most relevant to make

1665
01:18:14,686 --> 01:18:16,366
The second is that

1666
01:18:16,366 --> 01:18:19,156
Now, this includes

1667
01:18:19,156 --> 01:18:21,556
to the most common actions

1668
01:18:22,486 --> 01:18:25,146
For example, we've

1669
01:18:25,146 --> 01:18:27,696
to reduce the number of steps

1670

1671

that your users will

if they won't take the

1673
01:18:36,626 --> 01:18:41,076
And the third is ensuring that

1674
01:18:41,436 --> 01:18:43,526
by keeping them up to

1675
01:18:43,526 --> 01:18:44,746

of complications

1684
01:19:08,046 --> 01:19:11,016
So these three interfaces are

1685
01:19:11,016 --> 01:19:13,396
into your one app,

1686
01:19:13,396 --> 01:19:15,116
that they present

1687
01:19:15,906 --> 01:19:18,536
When you update any one of

1688
01:19:18,536 --> 01:19:20,496
of them because if they're

1689
01:19:20,496 --> 01:19:23,906
information, then your users

1690
01:19:24,706 --> 01:19:27,266
Now, you may remember

1691
01:19:27,266 --> 01:19:28,866
there was a fourth

1695
01:19:39,926 --> 01:19:42,616
and is instantly

1696
01:19:42,616 --> 01:19:44,526
with just a press

1697
01:19:45,746 --> 01:19:48,226
If your watchOS 2 app

1698
01:19:48,436 --> 01:19:51,786
that separate interface is no

1699
01:19:52,236 --> 01:19:55,466
but its simple design can help

1700
01:19:55,466 --> 01:19:57,786
for your application to

1701
01:19:57,786 --> 01:20:00,106
and works great when

1702

Now, that's obviously a very

1707
01:20:13,266 --> 01:20:15,016
for it can be a great guide

over a longer period of time.

1713
01:20:29,106 --> 01:20:30,746
For example, I may refer back

1714

To make this really easy,

1731
01:21:11,436 --> 01:21:13,586

1816
01:24:50,796 --> 01:24:54,326
for watchOS 2, which shows

1817
01:24:54,566 --> 01:24:58,796

So right now, you can

1819
01:24:59,406 --> 01:25:01,896
So right now, you can

1820
01:25:02,416 --> 01:25:03,616
If I now suspend the app,

1821
01:25:04,696 --> 01:25:07,366
you can see that I have a

1822
01:25:07,366 --> 01:25:11,176
that he's happy, but here is

1823
01:25:11,176 --> 01:25:12,786
that suddenly Max

1824
01:25:13,636 --> 01:25:17,066
Now, this app for watchOS

1825
01:25:17,066 --> 01:25:18,066
which I'm going to show you now.

1826
01:25:18,526 --> 01:25:20,936
The first is that when I

1827
01:25:21,456 --> 01:25:24,046
my complication has not

1828
01:25:24,256 --> 01:25:25,306
that Max is now hungry.

1829
01:25:26,556 --> 01:25:31,136
And even worse, when I go

1830
01:25:31,136 --> 01:25:34,886
of the app in the Dock also

1831
01:25:34,886 --> 01:25:38,146
to show a unified set of data

1832
01:25:38,566 --> 01:25:42,656
across all the interfaces

1833
01:25:42,886 --> 01:25:46,026
So going now to the code,

1834
01:25:46,026 --> 01:25:48,326
in watchOS 3 to address

1835
01:25:49,866 --> 01:25:52,636
In my extension delegate, I

01:25:52,856 --> 01:25:55,806

1837
01:25:55,886 --> 01:25:58,346
to update all of these

1838
01:25:59,536 --> 01:26:01,946
Here in my Snapshot

1839
01:25:59,536 --> 01:26:01,946
Here in my Snapshot

1840
01:26:02,176 --> 01:26:03,776
I'm going to add just

1841
01:26:03,776 --> 01:26:05,096
to address both of

1842
01:26:05,556 --> 01:26:07,666
The first is to update

1843
01:26:08,636 --> 01:26:12,436
for my current friend's

1844
01:26:12,436 --> 01:26:16,916
I'm going to also reload

1845
01:26:16,916 --> 01:26:19,446
when the snapshot is taken.

1846
01:26:19,446 --> 01:26:21,936
Okay, so that should address

1847
01:26:22,256 --> 01:26:23,406
But while we're in here,

1848
01:26:23,406 --> 01:26:27,266
let me make this app a little

1849
01:26:27,266 --> 01:26:30,206
Max was kind of just a

1850
01:26:30,566 --> 01:26:34,696
But in watchOS 3, we can

1851
01:26:34,926 --> 01:26:36,216
to make some animation happen.

1852
01:26:37,536 --> 01:26:39,816
So I'm going to switch

1853
01:26:40,306 --> 01:26:42,046
and here's my application

I'm going to delete the image

1855
01:26:51,116 --> 01:26:54,056
Now, I wrote a tiny bit

1856
01:26:54,056 --> 01:26:57,416
to populate this scene

1857
01:26:57,416 --> 01:26:59,676
and to make an outlet, which

1858
01:27:00,636 --> 01:27:04,196
Drag it into my SceneKit

1859
01:27:05,706 --> 01:27:08,276

to your application itself,

1861
01:27:11,026 --> 01:27:13,696

1862
01:27:13,766 --> 01:27:15,286

1863
01:27:15,966 --> 01:27:17,776

01:27:17,776 --> 01:27:21,266
I need to resize

1865
01:27:22,496 --> 01:27:24,446
Hook it up to the outlet.

1866
01:27:29,566 --> 01:27:31,396
All right, and with those

1867
01:27:31,396 --> 01:27:32,486
and run this application again,

1868
01:27:32,596 --> 01:27:35,496
and we'll hopefully see

1869
01:27:35,496 --> 01:27:36,566
dynamic this time.

1870
01:27:46,346 --> 01:27:48,506
So here we have a much

1871
01:27:48,506 --> 01:27:53,226
of Max running around, and when

1872
01:27:54,266 --> 01:27:55,666
wait for him to get hungry.

1873
01:28:00,226 --> 01:28:02,876
We see a really sad,

1874
01:28:03,046 --> 01:28:04,656
of Max rubbing his tummy.

[ Applause ]

1876
01:28:09,106 --> 01:28:10,596
So I think this is

1877
01:28:10,596 --> 01:28:14,376
When I dismiss the notification,

1878
01:28:14,376 --> 01:28:18,216
as we hoped to reflect his

1879
01:28:18,216 --> 01:28:20,096
in the Dock, you can see

1880
01:28:20,096 --> 01:28:22,596
that the snapshot has also

1881
01:28:22,656 --> 01:28:23,886
that he's hungry

1882
01:28:24,386 --> 01:28:27,286
So that's just a few of the

1883
01:28:27,286 --> 01:28:29,356
with the new APIs in watchOS 3.

1884
01:28:29,356 --> 01:28:30,876
We're excited to see

1885
01:28:31,256 --> 01:28:33,116
And next up, I'd like

1886
01:28:33,116 --> 01:28:34,666

1889
01:28:44,196 --> 01:28:46,656
We've been super excited

1890
01:28:46,656 --> 01:28:48,546
to Apple TV just

1891
01:28:49,716 --> 01:28:53,176
because we believe the future

01:28:56,976 --> 01:29:00,166
to the App Store, including

to the App Store, including

health and fitness, and

1896
01:29:03,716 --> 01:29:06,376
So let's talk about what it

1897
01:29:07,756 --> 01:29:09,156
First, it's already

1898
01:29:09,156 --> 01:29:11,576
You use all the tools and

1899
01:29:13,036 --> 01:29:14,916
And tvOS includes the

1900
01:29:14,916 --> 01:29:16,626
that you're familiar

1901
01:29:17,786 --> 01:29:20,126
Plus, we've got some

1902
01:29:20,126 --> 01:29:21,076
to tvOS that we've built.

1903
01:29:22,556 --> 01:29:24,296
There's all the foundational

1904
01:29:24,296 --> 01:29:25,206
for building great apps.

1905
01:29:25,576 --> 01:29:28,366
We have a rich media stack

1906
01:29:28,366 --> 01:29:31,506
And of course, we've got

1907
01:29:31,506 --> 01:29:35,696
And we're bringing even more

1908
01:29:36,456 --> 01:29:38,926
With PhotoKit, you can now

1909
01:29:38,956 --> 01:29:41,016
that showcase users'

1910
01:29:41,886 --> 01:29:45,726
and we've made it super easy to

1911
01:29:46,176 --> 01:29:47,706
excuse me, our light/dark

1912
01:29:49,986 --> 01:29:51,386
So it's a rich set

1913
01:29:51,386 --> 01:29:52,446
and this is just a partial list.

1914
01:29:52,446 --> 01:29:53,336
There's a whole lot more.

1915
01:29:54,116 --> 01:29:58,546
Let's talk about using

1916
01:29:58,546 --> 01:29:59,496
and bringing them all together

1917
01:29:59,496 --> 01:30:02,976
to deliver a great

1918

to deliver a great

1919
01:30:03,126 --> 01:30:05,416
And I want to start with Touch.

1920
01:30:05,416 --> 01:30:07,186
When designing tvOS,

1921
01:30:07,186 --> 01:30:09,536
to bring a first-class Touch

1922
01:30:10,606 --> 01:30:12,496
Now, Touch needs to feel

1923
01:30:12,496 --> 01:30:14,116
It needs to be predictable.

1924
01:30:14,116 --> 01:30:15,206
It needs to be fun.

1925
01:30:16,026 --> 01:30:17,716
That's a particular

1926
01:30:17,716 --> 01:30:19,006
when the TV's 10 feet away.

1927
01:30:21,096 --> 01:30:22,426
So let's look at

1928
01:30:22,896 --> 01:30:26,076
We have updated UIKit

1929
01:30:26,076 --> 01:30:27,896
and views look beautiful

1930
01:30:29,206 --> 01:30:31,876
We've added UIFocus to allow

1931
01:30:31,876 --> 01:30:33,126
of your UI are focusable.

1932
01:30:34,336 --> 01:30:37,546
And we have updated

1933
01:30:37,546 --> 01:30:38,506
from the focus engine.

1934
01:30:39,586 --> 01:30:41,586
Now, altogether this

1935
01:30:41,586 --> 01:30:43,256
between what the user

1936
01:30:43,256 --> 01:30:44,896
and what they see

1937
01:30:46,926 --> 01:30:48,786
Good news here is that we've

1938
01:30:48,846 --> 01:30:49,356
for you.

1939
01:30:50,136 --> 01:30:51,766
Your UIKit apps will get

1942
01:30:57,076 --> 01:30:58,996
We've got a lot of great apps

We have a technology

1944
01:30:59,806 --> 01:31:01,646
We have a technology

1945
01:31:01,646 --> 01:31:02,876
a framework called TVMLKit.

1946
01:31:04,036 --> 01:31:07,236
TVMLKit is a new, high-level

1947
01:31:07,236 --> 01:31:07,756
for tvOS.

1948
01:31:08,766 --> 01:31:11,306
It's built on top of

1949
01:31:11,306 --> 01:31:13,376
that connective Touch

1950
01:31:15,156 --> 01:31:16,496

and native controls.

1953
01:31:21,936 --> 01:31:24,346
TVMLKit has allowed teams

1954

highly stylized, customized

1955

Let's now talk about how you can

1957
01:31:37,646 --> 01:31:39,536
One easy thing to do is

1958
01:31:39,536 --> 01:31:40,666
in the cloud using CloudKit.

1959
01:31:41,966 --> 01:31:44,436
Making it easier for users to

1960
01:31:44,866 --> 01:31:46,466
and pick it up and resume

1961
01:31:46,466 --> 01:31:47,946
on their iPhone or iPad.

1962
01:31:52,586 --> 01:31:53,726
We've also seen some great apps

1963
01:31:53,726 --> 01:31:55,736
that use multiple Apple

We have really great

2021
01:34:28,386 --> 01:34:32,236
So we're building

for our latest iPads and

2023
01:34:35,856 --> 01:34:38,266
of reproducing absolutely

2024
01:34:39,466 --> 01:34:41,526
In fact, as DisplayMate says,

2025

"The color accuracy is visually

So how do we do this?

2027

Well, this is all

2028
01:34:51,246 --> 01:34:54,476
So most displays are built

2029
01:34:54,476 --> 01:34:57,596
which is narrow and doesn't

or paint colors or maybe

So we're moving to the wide P3

to our ability to really

01:35:11,406 --> 01:35:12,816
and render these

We're going to go

From our system APIs to

If you have to manipulate wide

01:36:01,056 --> 01:36:01,726
I'd like to talk

2053
01:36:01,726 --> 01:36:04,046
about technology now

2054
01:36:04,046 --> 01:36:05,696
of industry, and that's Metal.

2055
01:36:06,906 --> 01:36:08,756
Metal we introduced

2056
01:36:08,756 --> 01:36:10,516
and has been wildly successful.

2057
01:36:10,516 --> 01:36:13,126
And keep in mind, when

2058
01:36:13,326 --> 01:36:16,666
when we enhance it, we enhance

2059
01:36:16,666 --> 01:36:19,676
Which allows us to innovate

2060
01:36:19,676 --> 01:36:22,676
like Metal tessellation that

2061
01:36:22,866 --> 01:36:25,076
for rendering accuracy

01:36:28,216 --> 01:36:31,716

And for things like

2067
01:36:39,686 --> 01:36:42,416
which use the architecture

2068
01:36:42,876 --> 01:36:44,276
to reduce the amount

2069
01:36:44,276 --> 01:36:46,186
in your application

2070
01:36:46,526 --> 01:36:47,896
Which allows your application

2071
01:36:47,896 --> 01:36:51,526
to specialize the way it handles

2072
01:36:54,736 --> 01:36:55,906
And Metal is everywhere.

2073
01:36:56,226 --> 01:36:59,406

and major game engines

2076
01:37:05,776 --> 01:37:07,476
So whether you're

2077
01:37:07,476 --> 01:37:09,806
or programming directly

2078

you get all the performance

Another thing about Metal,

2080
01:37:15,996 --> 01:37:18,036
it's one of our foundational

2081
01:37:18,616 --> 01:37:19,626
of our games ecosystem.

2082
01:37:19,626 --> 01:37:21,236
So let's talk about games.

2083
01:37:23,776 --> 01:37:26,906
Over the past few years, we've

2084
01:37:27,056 --> 01:37:30,936
and the goal of this is to

2085
01:37:30,936 --> 01:37:33,406
which allow you to take

2086
01:37:33,526 --> 01:37:34,686
and turn them into reality.

2087
01:37:34,856 --> 01:37:37,006
I want to cover some

2088
01:37:38,386 --> 01:37:40,206
First, as mentioned this

2089
01:37:40,996 --> 01:37:42,416
We introduced Replay

2090
01:37:42,416 --> 01:37:43,996
and it's really super

2091
01:37:44,676 --> 01:37:48,386
It allows your users to start

2092
01:37:49,846 --> 01:37:53,036
edit that recording, and then

2093
01:37:54,196 --> 01:37:56,036
Well, this year, we're

2094
01:37:56,576 --> 01:37:59,056
with ReplayKit Streaming.

2095
01:38:00,186 --> 01:38:03,076
Now, Replay Kit can

2096
01:38:03,076 --> 01:38:05,456
that support the ReplayKit

2097
01:38:06,016 --> 01:38:11,296
This allows your users to not

2098
01:38:11,296 --> 01:38:13,396
with their friends

2099
01:38:13,476 --> 01:38:16,796
to the internet automatically

2100
01:38:16,926 --> 01:38:18,566

2102
01:38:23,476 --> 01:38:26,586
And even better, it's about

2103
01:38:26,586 --> 01:38:27,716
if you already use Replay Kit.

2104
01:38:27,716 --> 01:38:31,096
This is super easy and could

2105
01:38:31,206 --> 01:38:32,246
of your applications.

2106
01:38:33,026 --> 01:38:37,456
So speaking of social, let's

2107
01:38:37,616 --> 01:38:40,026
We're changing the way that

2108
01:38:40,526 --> 01:38:42,586
Now with our latest OS's,

2109
01:38:42,996 --> 01:38:46,026
you can invite anyone you

2110
01:38:46,026 --> 01:38:47,986
So your users can invite

2111
01:38:47,986 --> 01:38:50,126
out via message,

2112
01:38:50,126 --> 01:38:52,366
It's just as easy as

2113
01:38:53,716 --> 01:38:55,996
And the cool thing here is if

2114
01:38:55,996 --> 01:38:58,516
that are multiplayer APIs,

but it is clearly

2146
01:40:28,296 --> 01:40:32,616
with the island bounds, so

2147
01:40:32,616 --> 01:40:34,496
Opening our Xcode

2148
01:40:34,496 --> 01:40:35,836
at the source code section,

2149
01:40:36,406 --> 01:40:39,436
I have already written a

01:40:39,436 --> 01:40:41,776
GKComponent provided

2151
01:40:42,276 --> 01:40:43,506
like the fight component here.

2152
01:40:44,226 --> 01:40:47,656
And in Xcode 8, I

2153
01:40:47,656 --> 01:40:52,766
of my class properties

2154
01:40:52,766 --> 01:40:56,236
to the 2D editor then I can

2155
01:40:56,236 --> 01:40:58,146
gets attached to one

2156
01:40:59,236 --> 01:41:00,546
So to build the island map,

2157
01:40:59,236 --> 01:41:00,546
So to build the island map,

2158
01:41:01,046 --> 01:41:03,286
I've been using the

2159
01:41:03,836 --> 01:41:06,486
So in my game, there's

2160
01:41:06,946 --> 01:41:07,886
that I have specified.

2161
01:41:08,516 --> 01:41:10,386
There's sand, water, and grass.

2162
01:41:11,416 --> 01:41:15,166
Not only do I have the ability

2163
01:41:15,166 --> 01:41:18,526
and exterior tiles, I can

2164
01:41:19,006 --> 01:41:21,556
So here for the red

2165
01:41:21,946 --> 01:41:25,236
for this individual tile image,

2166
01:41:25,236 --> 01:41:28,646
to it to get rid of the small

2167
01:41:28,646 --> 01:41:29,826
in from the Media Library.

2168
01:41:30,316 --> 01:41:32,016
And now this tile

2169
01:41:32,496 --> 01:41:34,886
Let me go ahead and show

2170
01:41:35,576 --> 01:41:41,766
So switching back to the island

2171
01:41:41,826 --> 01:41:44,146
with the new tile map

2172
01:41:44,146 --> 01:41:47,376
provided by SpriteKit, so

2173
01:41:47,376 --> 01:41:48,976
I can simply select

2174
01:41:49,336 --> 01:41:51,946
Make a double click, and

2175
01:41:51,946 --> 01:41:53,106
that I want to work on.

2176
01:41:53,426 --> 01:41:56,226
Now that I think the island

2177
01:41:56,646 --> 01:42:00,656
and to make such modifications,

2178
01:41:56,646 --> 01:42:00,656
and to make such modifications,

2179
01:42:00,966 --> 01:42:05,286
across the level and Xcode will

2180
01:42:05,366 --> 01:42:07,226
tiles to make it with

2181
01:42:07,496 --> 01:42:08,116
It's that easy.

2182
01:42:09,096 --> 01:42:11,966
So now I think I got the look

2183
01:42:12,116 --> 01:42:14,016
Let's look at some of the

2184
01:42:14,806 --> 01:42:20,346
To power the hero, our hero's

2185
01:42:20,346 --> 01:42:22,966
I have already attached

2186
01:42:23,016 --> 01:42:24,076
and the move component.

2187
01:42:24,836 --> 01:42:29,126
And to make the player

2188
01:42:29,296 --> 01:42:32,296
I can simply add a collision

2189
01:42:32,886 --> 01:42:35,406
So this way, it will

2190
01:42:35,406 --> 01:42:37,986
body for our hero

2191
01:42:37,986 --> 01:42:40,986
on the current tile sets

2192
01:42:41,336 --> 01:42:43,166
And to give the player

2193
01:42:43,166 --> 01:42:45,006
to throw the water balloons,

2194
01:42:45,006 --> 01:42:47,516
I can simply add the

2195
01:42:47,976 --> 01:42:51,246
And notice here how the

2196
01:42:51,246 --> 01:42:53,616
by the fight component

2197
01:42:53,616 --> 01:42:56,316
I can give it a custom

2198
01:42:56,316 --> 01:42:59,706
So for example, I can set

2199
01:42:59,706 --> 01:43:01,786
than using the default

2200
01:42:59,706 --> 01:43:01,786
than using the default

2201
01:43:02,456 --> 01:43:05,736
And in addition, I have

2202
01:43:06,046 --> 01:43:08,146
these paint balloons

2203
01:43:08,416 --> 01:43:10,376
and I have a enemy

2204
01:43:11,026 --> 01:43:14,106
So to give the enemy the same

2205
01:43:14,106 --> 01:43:16,676
up the paint balloons

2206
01:43:17,066 --> 01:43:19,146
I'm going to give the

2207
01:43:19,676 --> 01:43:21,406
And to make this a fair game,

2208
01:43:21,406 --> 01:43:24,126
I'm going to give the same

2209
01:43:24,126 --> 01:43:26,616
than using the default

2210
01:43:27,796 --> 01:43:30,236
Now, I think my level

2211
01:43:30,236 --> 01:43:33,206
Let's run it and check it

2212
01:43:34,526 --> 01:43:35,426
So the drones are going

2213
01:43:35,426 --> 01:43:38,126
to be dropping randomly

2214
01:43:38,126 --> 01:43:40,376
and the paintball

2215
01:43:40,376 --> 01:43:42,906
So looks like all the

2216
01:43:43,196 --> 01:43:48,186
So in Xcode 8, it's very easy to

2217
01:43:48,186 --> 01:43:52,826
and connect all these

2218
01:43:53,076 --> 01:43:55,526

01:44:33,066 --> 01:44:33,956
But these are just two

2235
01:44:33,956 --> 01:44:36,066
of the many new APIs we

2236
01:44:36,996 --> 01:44:39,336
And support for all of

2237
01:44:39,366 --> 01:44:41,376
by a new version

2238
01:44:41,696 --> 01:44:44,876
Xcode 8 is going to run on

2239
01:44:44,936 --> 01:44:46,656
Now, of course, it

2240
01:44:46,656 --> 01:44:48,046
for developing with Swift 3.

2241
01:44:49,376 --> 01:44:51,736
Now, all these technologies

2242
01:44:51,736 --> 01:44:53,946
from the WWDC Attendee

2243
01:44:53,946 --> 01:44:56,916
so you can get early access and

2244
01:44:56,916 --> 01:44:59,616
when we ship out products to

2245
01:44:59,756 --> 01:45:02,506
create even more powerful and

2246
01:44:59,756 --> 01:45:02,506
create even more powerful and

2247
01:45:03,816 --> 01:45:05,726
Also, go and check out the

2248
01:45:06,216 --> 01:45:08,536
which we're including in the

2249
01:45:08,536 --> 01:45:10,286
I think you're going to

2250
01:45:10,666 --> 01:45:12,736
and perhaps you'll consider

2251
01:45:12,796 --> 01:45:15,036
for your kids to start

2252
01:45:16,256 --> 01:45:18,096
Now, there are many

2253
01:45:18,096 --> 01:45:20,156
at the conference for you to

2254
01:45:20,156 --> 01:45:21,196
that we announced today.

2255
01:45:21,196 --> 01:45:23,046
There's more than 100

2256
01:45:23,046 --> 01:45:23,896
and even more labs.

2257
01:45:24,296 --> 01:45:27,106
You can meet every engineer

2258
01:45:27,106 --> 01:45:29,296
They are here to answer

2259
01:45:30,296 --> 01:45:32,006
So I hope you enjoyed the

2260
01:45:32,006 --> 01:45:33,376
around later this week.

2261
