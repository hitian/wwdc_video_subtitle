&gt;&gt; Good evening.

4
00:00:29,576 --> 00:00:31,906
My name is Robby Walker,

5
00:00:31,906 --> 00:00:35,376
by Brandon Newendorp and Corey

6
00:00:36,966 --> 00:00:38,906
First I'm going to start

7
00:00:38,906 --> 00:00:42,016
about what SiriKit is, and at

8
00:00:43,146 --> 00:00:45,456
Then Brandon's going to talk

9
00:00:45,456 --> 00:00:48,186
or two to connect your

10
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:51,196
And then Corey's going to

11
00:00:51,196 --> 00:00:53,816
and design a great

12
00:00:53,976 --> 00:00:55,106
which is meaningfully different

13
00:00:55,436 --> 00:00:57,356
than designing a great

14
00:00:58,076 --> 00:01:00,206
But first, let's

15
00:00:58,076 --> 00:01:00,206
But first, let's

16
00:01:00,206 --> 00:01:00,906
Who is Siri?

17
00:01:04,376 --> 00:01:07,816
Siri is your virtual assistant,

18
00:01:08,046 --> 00:01:08,976
whether it's by adding

19
00:01:13,436 --> 00:01:15,896
or much more frequently, by

20
00:01:15,896 --> 00:01:19,376
and alerting you to potential

21
00:01:19,546 --> 00:01:23,076
We're going to talk about an

22
00:01:23,076 --> 00:01:25,436
with Siri, and when

23
00:01:25,686 --> 00:01:27,646
we built a fake application.

24
00:01:27,926 --> 00:01:29,646
So we wanted to name it

25
00:01:30,096 --> 00:01:32,056
but we kind of felt like it was

26
00:01:32,056 --> 00:01:34,346
to name it after a very

27
00:01:34,836 --> 00:01:36,276
So we called it Unicorn Chat.

28
00:01:37,506 --> 00:01:40,616
And then because we wanted it

29
00:01:40,896 --> 00:01:41,976
we gave it a really sweet icon.

[ Applause ]

31
00:01:48,636 --> 00:01:50,796
So you can imagine someone

32
00:01:50,796 --> 00:01:52,576
Siri, send a Unicorn

33
00:01:53,896 --> 00:01:55,666
Siri might respond "To whom?"

34
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:58,006
Then you might say,

35
00:01:58,006 --> 00:01:59,936
of the Unicorn names of

36
00:02:00,596 --> 00:02:03,216
Then you would -- then Siri

37
00:02:03,216 --> 00:02:05,996
to say to Celestra, and then

38
00:02:06,246 --> 00:02:07,766
"Let's add more sparkle

39
00:02:07,966 --> 00:02:08,846
because as everyone knows,

40
00:02:09,076 --> 00:02:10,436
Unicorns love sparkle

41
00:02:11,036 --> 00:02:13,946
But there's a lot of ways to

42
00:02:15,556 --> 00:02:18,366
Someone else might say

43
00:02:18,616 --> 00:02:19,916
saying something

44
00:02:19,916 --> 00:02:21,316
to Celestra in Unicorn Chat."

45
00:02:21,316 --> 00:02:24,586
And then of course, Siri

46
00:02:24,586 --> 00:02:27,996
and then the user would fill

47
00:02:27,996 --> 00:02:30,936
Other users might do the exact

48
00:02:30,936 --> 00:02:33,446
"Unicorn Chat Celestra, let's

49
00:02:34,676 --> 00:02:37,416
Somebody else might say an

50
00:02:37,606 --> 00:02:40,716
which I will not attempt to say.

51
00:02:40,716 --> 00:02:43,516
And other users will be

52
00:02:43,516 --> 00:02:45,486
and might say something

53
00:02:45,486 --> 00:02:48,076
can you please do me a favor

54
00:02:48,076 --> 00:02:49,926
to send a text with the

00:02:49,926 --> 00:02:50,806
sparkle transitions."

56
00:02:51,556 --> 00:02:54,326
And despite using 27 words

57
00:02:54,326 --> 00:02:56,186
they actually forgot to

58
00:02:56,186 --> 00:02:56,866
to send the message to.

59
00:02:56,936 --> 00:03:00,836
And then even then, they

60
00:02:56,936 --> 00:03:00,836
And then even then, they

61
00:03:00,836 --> 00:03:02,736
and say something like, "My

62
00:03:03,446 --> 00:03:05,856
So the point is, there

63
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:07,276
to say the same thing to Siri.

64
00:03:07,276 --> 00:03:10,146
And there are also a lot of

65
00:03:10,506 --> 00:03:12,686
So for example, if

66
00:03:12,686 --> 00:03:14,766
and you're pressing the

67
00:03:14,766 --> 00:03:17,626
to provide more visual responses

68
00:03:18,146 --> 00:03:20,136
But if you're invoking

69
00:03:20,376 --> 00:03:23,156
like our friend Cookie Monster,

70
00:03:23,156 --> 00:03:25,676
Siri's going to say

71
00:03:25,876 --> 00:03:29,096
And the Siri experience is

72
00:03:29,206 --> 00:03:31,666
to meet the accessibility

73
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:34,016
to a lot of different

74
00:03:35,376 --> 00:03:37,426
So in the end of the day,

75
00:03:37,426 --> 00:03:40,436
there's basically a

76
00:03:40,436 --> 00:03:41,746
that people use Siri,

77
00:03:41,746 --> 00:03:43,806
of how they phrase

78
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:45,226
of how Siri will respond.

79
00:03:45,656 --> 00:03:47,216
And the question then becomes,

80
00:03:47,606 --> 00:03:49,586
how do we make sure we're

81
00:03:49,586 --> 00:03:51,756
experience for our users?

82
00:03:51,956 --> 00:03:55,176
How do we make sure it's really

83
00:03:55,176 --> 00:03:56,056
within a single domain?

84
00:03:56,816 --> 00:03:58,686
And most importantly, for

85
00:03:59,036 --> 00:04:00,726
how do we make sure it's

86
00:03:59,036 --> 00:04:00,726
how do we make sure it's

87
00:04:00,986 --> 00:04:03,116
so that as many people as

88
00:04:03,116 --> 00:04:05,446
of their favorite applications

89
00:04:05,446 --> 00:04:09,446
And the answer is that Siri

90
00:04:09,826 --> 00:04:11,936
and your application just

91
00:04:11,936 --> 00:04:14,276
So I'll go into a little more

92
00:04:15,576 --> 00:04:16,906
The first thing that Siri does,

93
00:04:16,906 --> 00:04:18,846
is understand what

94
00:04:18,846 --> 00:04:21,805
So we take audio and

95
00:04:22,766 --> 00:04:24,226
Then we take that

96
00:04:24,226 --> 00:04:26,276
into a structured representation

97
00:04:26,276 --> 00:04:28,216
to do, something

98
00:04:28,926 --> 00:04:32,386
Based on that intent, Siri then

99
00:04:32,656 --> 00:04:33,676
the user wanted to accomplish.

100
00:04:34,196 --> 00:04:37,006
And then Siri provides

101
00:04:37,136 --> 00:04:38,246
both visual and verbal.

102
00:04:39,546 --> 00:04:40,406
And so there's a lot here.

103
00:04:40,576 --> 00:04:42,446
There's a lot of work that

104
00:04:42,776 --> 00:04:44,506
There's a lot of deep

105
00:04:44,506 --> 00:04:45,866
There's convolutional

106
00:04:45,866 --> 00:04:47,026
There's LSTMs, there's CRFs,

107
00:04:47,026 --> 00:04:49,126
there's SVMs, there's

108
00:04:49,446 --> 00:04:51,366
And we wanted to make sure

109
00:04:51,596 --> 00:04:53,316
you could really

110
00:04:53,316 --> 00:04:55,596
that your app already does, and

111
00:04:56,626 --> 00:04:57,836
The first one is vocabulary.

112
00:04:58,766 --> 00:05:01,136
This is how your application

113
00:04:58,766 --> 00:05:01,136
This is how your application

114
00:05:01,176 --> 00:05:01,666
to know about.

115
00:05:02,106 --> 00:05:04,156
And Brandon will tell you

116
00:05:04,576 --> 00:05:06,326
The second one is app logic.

117
00:05:06,696 --> 00:05:08,476
This is the functionality

118
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:11,416
And then the last one is of

119
00:05:12,836 --> 00:05:14,186
So let's go through

120
00:05:14,186 --> 00:05:15,356
and see a little bit

121
00:05:17,566 --> 00:05:18,916
So somebody says, "Hey Siri,

122
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:20,826
please send a Unicorn

123
00:05:21,436 --> 00:05:23,176
The first rule that your

124
00:05:23,176 --> 00:05:24,656
to help Siri understand

125
00:05:25,066 --> 00:05:26,746
So Siri doesn't have

126
00:05:27,296 --> 00:05:29,686
in its database,

127
00:05:29,866 --> 00:05:31,836
So by sharing that information

128
00:05:31,836 --> 00:05:33,216
that Siri understands

129
00:05:34,536 --> 00:05:36,496
This also helps Siri

130
00:05:36,496 --> 00:05:37,756
that Celestra is a contact

131
00:05:37,756 --> 00:05:39,206
because when you provide

132
00:05:39,206 --> 00:05:41,526
you will provide it by saying

133
00:05:41,526 --> 00:05:42,916
or in another example

134
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:45,546
these are names of photo albums.

135
00:05:45,706 --> 00:05:48,316
Now Siri understands that

136
00:05:48,316 --> 00:05:49,916
to send a message you

137
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:50,926
of course, just a recipient.

138
00:05:50,926 --> 00:05:51,816
You need a message.

139
00:05:52,146 --> 00:05:55,016
And so Siri will quickly check

140
00:05:55,016 --> 00:05:57,916
"Do you actually require

141
00:05:57,976 --> 00:05:59,616
And if your application

142
00:05:59,986 --> 00:06:01,656
then Siri will ask a

143
00:05:59,986 --> 00:06:01,656
then Siri will ask a

144
00:06:02,016 --> 00:06:04,096
So really that's all your

145
00:06:04,096 --> 00:06:07,356
of specify on an individual

146
00:06:07,356 --> 00:06:07,976
your constraints.

147
00:06:11,126 --> 00:06:13,046
The next thing that happens

148
00:06:13,046 --> 00:06:14,516
that information

149
00:06:14,866 --> 00:06:16,806
So rather than having to

150
00:06:16,806 --> 00:06:19,336
of language and phrasing, and

151
00:06:19,336 --> 00:06:21,736
about earlier, your application

152
00:06:21,736 --> 00:06:22,426
simple object.

153
00:06:22,936 --> 00:06:25,826
And then it hands off to your

154
00:06:26,046 --> 00:06:29,896
you know, processing the intent

155
00:06:30,046 --> 00:06:30,816
And then of course,

156
00:06:30,816 --> 00:06:32,806
Siri provides a user

157
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:36,026
And you have the option to

158
00:06:36,026 --> 00:06:38,976
to customize the user interface

159
00:06:42,156 --> 00:06:44,586
So that's a very, very high

160
00:06:44,976 --> 00:06:47,536
The idea was to make it

161
00:06:47,926 --> 00:06:49,276
but still connect

162
00:06:49,276 --> 00:06:50,516
of conversational interactions.

163
00:06:50,796 --> 00:06:53,266
And now to tell you a little bit

00:06:53,266 --> 00:06:54,796

&gt;&gt; Thanks Robby, I

169
00:07:06,206 --> 00:07:09,326
to tell you all a little bit

170
00:07:09,676 --> 00:07:11,916
and how you're going to be

171
00:07:12,156 --> 00:07:14,616
when you adopt SiriKit

172
00:07:15,096 --> 00:07:17,176
Now pay close attention

173
00:07:17,176 --> 00:07:17,916
"intents" stuff.

174
00:07:18,996 --> 00:07:20,956
To get started, I want to talk

175
00:07:20,956 --> 00:07:23,916
about how SiriKit

176
00:07:24,466 --> 00:07:27,396
At a high level, Siri

177
00:07:27,396 --> 00:07:28,666
in the idea of a domain.

178
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:31,276
Where a domain is a

179
00:07:31,276 --> 00:07:34,066
that Siri understands and

180
00:07:34,656 --> 00:07:37,996
For example, things like

181
00:07:38,106 --> 00:07:41,246
and sending payments, are

182
00:07:41,476 --> 00:07:43,926
and are some of the

183
00:07:43,926 --> 00:07:45,026
up with SiriKit this year.

184
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:48,296
Within a domain,

185
00:07:48,816 --> 00:07:50,916
Where an intent describes

186
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:54,406
that Siri understands, and can

187
00:07:55,096 --> 00:07:57,256
Now I'd like to break down

188
00:07:57,486 --> 00:07:59,656
with another example, in

189
00:07:59,656 --> 00:08:01,116
than what Robby was

190
00:07:59,656 --> 00:08:01,116
than what Robby was

191
00:08:02,046 --> 00:08:03,646
So in this case, we have

192
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:06,496
Hey Siri, send Buttercup

193
00:08:06,496 --> 00:08:08,626
on Unicorn Pay for

194
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:11,916
Now Siri understands

195
00:08:12,126 --> 00:08:13,286
in the payments domain.

196
00:08:13,876 --> 00:08:16,076
And specifically,

197
00:08:16,076 --> 00:08:18,196
that this is a send

198
00:08:19,196 --> 00:08:22,226
Now every intent has

199
00:08:22,656 --> 00:08:26,356
Where parameters are specific

200
00:08:26,766 --> 00:08:29,516
understand, and communicate

201
00:08:29,516 --> 00:08:32,236
And there's a lot of parameters

202
00:08:33,275 --> 00:08:35,596
We've recognized that

203
00:08:35,596 --> 00:08:38,025
and that the user is

204
00:08:38,025 --> 00:08:39,366
to someone named Buttercup.

205
00:08:40,336 --> 00:08:44,566
We've also recognized an amount

206
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:47,816
to be very smart, and recognize

207
00:08:48,066 --> 00:08:49,696
they probably meant US Dollars.

208
00:08:50,186 --> 00:08:52,616
And Siri can use a lot

209
00:08:52,686 --> 00:08:55,826
to understand what we think the

210
00:08:56,206 --> 00:08:58,206
basing it on things like

211
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:01,386
their Siri locale, and

212
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:01,386
their Siri locale, and

213
00:09:01,386 --> 00:09:02,116
to our system.

214
00:09:03,056 --> 00:09:05,826
And finally, we recognize

215
00:09:05,826 --> 00:09:07,976
to send a payment

216
00:09:10,046 --> 00:09:13,286
So there's this common language

217
00:09:13,776 --> 00:09:17,686
of intents that describe

218
00:09:17,686 --> 00:09:19,636
that are used to

219
00:09:19,636 --> 00:09:21,926
from your application

220
00:09:24,256 --> 00:09:26,836
So let's talk a little

221
00:09:27,756 --> 00:09:29,596
As I said, an intent

222
00:09:29,596 --> 00:09:32,366
that we're asking your app

223
00:09:32,366 --> 00:09:33,256
that we can communicate

224
00:09:33,256 --> 00:09:35,736
about between Apple

225
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:40,226
Every intent will have zero to

226
00:09:40,226 --> 00:09:43,766
to vary based on the

227
00:09:43,966 --> 00:09:46,086
and what Siri understands

228
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:49,046
and what we think is relevant to

229
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:52,476
And no matter what, an intent

230
00:09:52,476 --> 00:09:53,216
into a domain.

231
00:09:53,696 --> 00:09:55,056
So this is something

232
00:09:55,056 --> 00:09:57,796
about when you're getting

233
00:09:57,986 --> 00:10:00,686
in your application, is look

234
00:09:57,986 --> 00:10:00,686
in your application, is look

235
00:10:00,686 --> 00:10:03,086
of SiriKit, and think

236
00:10:03,086 --> 00:10:04,976
to make the most sense

237
00:10:06,736 --> 00:10:08,996
Now we also have

238
00:10:08,996 --> 00:10:12,646
And these are how you tell Siri

239
00:10:12,646 --> 00:10:14,366
that your app just performed.

240
00:10:15,796 --> 00:10:17,266
You're always going

241
00:10:17,266 --> 00:10:18,566
to communicate the result

242
00:10:18,806 --> 00:10:21,816
because there's always an intent

243
00:10:22,946 --> 00:10:25,856
Intent responses also can have

244
00:10:26,296 --> 00:10:29,356
which are used to describe

245
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:30,116
with that intent.

246
00:10:30,776 --> 00:10:33,346
Sometimes those parameters are

247
00:10:33,346 --> 00:10:35,526
on the intent, and other

248
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:37,416
because there's something

249
00:10:37,656 --> 00:10:39,306
from your app back to Siri.

250
00:10:40,626 --> 00:10:44,246
We also accept a response code

251
00:10:44,926 --> 00:10:47,926
These are used to tell

252
00:10:47,926 --> 00:10:50,816
about whether your app was able

253
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:54,486
and there's default ones,

254
00:10:54,766 --> 00:10:56,616
or failure that requires

255
00:10:57,096 --> 00:10:59,616
Some intents and domains have

256
00:11:00,566 --> 00:11:04,396
It's very important that you

257
00:11:04,396 --> 00:11:07,326
code back for your application

258
00:11:07,326 --> 00:11:10,156
to drive dialogue and make

259
00:11:10,366 --> 00:11:11,486
for all of your users.

260
00:11:12,846 --> 00:11:15,596
Finally, we have an

261
00:11:15,596 --> 00:11:16,526
to an intent response.

262
00:11:17,206 --> 00:11:19,556
Now if you're already supporting

263
00:11:19,766 --> 00:11:21,426
you're familiar with

264
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:25,026
We use NSUserActivities

265
00:11:25,216 --> 00:11:28,296
if the user needs to leave

266
00:11:28,296 --> 00:11:29,286
onto your application.

267
00:11:30,096 --> 00:11:34,206
Now by default, Siri is going to

268
00:11:34,206 --> 00:11:36,716
with the intent and

269
00:11:36,716 --> 00:11:39,316
to your application, so

270
00:11:39,316 --> 00:11:40,676
where you left off from Siri.

271
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:45,186
If you'd like to, you can

272
00:11:45,306 --> 00:11:47,256
and populate the

273
00:11:47,496 --> 00:11:49,546
with information that's

274
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:52,356
Just to make sure you create

275
00:11:52,356 --> 00:11:55,136
when users leave Siri and

276
00:11:56,046 --> 00:11:58,836
So those are intents,

277
00:11:59,316 --> 00:12:02,176
They're the fundamental

278
00:11:59,316 --> 00:12:02,176
They're the fundamental

279
00:12:02,176 --> 00:12:03,266
to your application

280
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:06,086
and understand what your

281
00:12:06,346 --> 00:12:06,976
on behalf of the user.

282
00:12:12,296 --> 00:12:15,116
The next thing I'd like to

283
00:12:15,256 --> 00:12:17,796
and Siri are going to

284
00:12:18,226 --> 00:12:19,996
Now there's three steps

285
00:12:19,996 --> 00:12:22,406
to go through, while

286
00:12:23,106 --> 00:12:24,366
The first of those is resolve.

287
00:12:24,936 --> 00:12:26,016
We're going to ask your app

288
00:12:26,016 --> 00:12:28,476
to resolve every

289
00:12:28,896 --> 00:12:31,396
And in fact, we will call

290
00:12:31,616 --> 00:12:34,226
for every parameter and

291
00:12:34,226 --> 00:12:37,516
for the same parameter

292
00:12:37,576 --> 00:12:38,656
on what they requested.

293
00:12:39,726 --> 00:12:42,866
The second step is confirm,

294
00:12:42,906 --> 00:12:45,206
to make sure that it's going to

295
00:12:45,546 --> 00:12:47,196
and tell us about

296
00:12:48,106 --> 00:12:50,536
And finally, most

297
00:12:50,846 --> 00:12:53,646
where you perform the specific

298
00:12:53,646 --> 00:12:56,976
Let's talk a little bit more

299
00:12:59,336 --> 00:13:01,506
The purpose of the

300
00:12:59,336 --> 00:13:01,506
The purpose of the

301
00:13:01,866 --> 00:13:05,196
is for you to help Siri

302
00:13:05,196 --> 00:13:07,726
and more importantly,

303
00:13:07,946 --> 00:13:10,676
when they started asking a

304
00:13:11,676 --> 00:13:14,006
This is also your

305
00:13:14,156 --> 00:13:17,056
to influence Siri's behavior

306
00:13:17,056 --> 00:13:19,146
over the conversation

307
00:13:19,286 --> 00:13:20,856
with the user of

308
00:13:22,026 --> 00:13:24,406
In order to do that,

309
00:13:24,406 --> 00:13:26,726
to provide a resolution

310
00:13:26,896 --> 00:13:29,426
And there's a number of

311
00:13:29,696 --> 00:13:32,916
for every type of data that

312
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:34,636
to ask your app to

313
00:13:34,636 --> 00:13:36,756
So let's go back to our example

314
00:13:36,846 --> 00:13:39,236
with sending Buttercup

315
00:13:39,236 --> 00:13:40,696
for that rainbow polish.

316
00:13:41,216 --> 00:13:43,786
And specifically, I'd

317
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:44,966
to the payee field.

318
00:13:45,486 --> 00:13:48,046
This is used to describe

319
00:13:48,526 --> 00:13:52,316
And it's important that

320
00:13:52,316 --> 00:13:55,496
all agree on what the user

321
00:13:55,546 --> 00:13:59,156
Now hopefully, the most

322
00:13:59,156 --> 00:14:00,916
from your app will be success.

323
00:13:59,156 --> 00:14:00,916
from your app will be success.

324
00:14:01,286 --> 00:14:04,036
Which means that you understood

325
00:14:04,296 --> 00:14:06,686
what they specified, and

326
00:14:06,686 --> 00:14:10,376
that you successfully understood

327
00:14:10,376 --> 00:14:12,386
to us to tell us

328
00:14:12,386 --> 00:14:13,806
what you successfully matched.

329
00:14:14,016 --> 00:14:15,036
In this case, it means

330
00:14:15,036 --> 00:14:17,956
that Unicorn Pay totally

331
00:14:19,226 --> 00:14:22,816
Now sometimes, your app is going

332
00:14:23,186 --> 00:14:24,146
but it wants to make sure

333
00:14:24,146 --> 00:14:26,906
that the user really meant what

334
00:14:26,906 --> 00:14:27,506
choice about.

335
00:14:27,506 --> 00:14:30,276
So we have a confirmation

336
00:14:30,746 --> 00:14:32,206
This is where you can ask Siri

337
00:14:32,566 --> 00:14:36,256
to have the user double

338
00:14:36,446 --> 00:14:38,366
and provide a yes

339
00:14:38,916 --> 00:14:41,996
So in this case, for Unicorn

340
00:14:41,996 --> 00:14:43,366
that the user meant

341
00:14:43,366 --> 00:14:43,976
when they said Buttercup.

342
00:14:46,116 --> 00:14:49,276
Now there's other times that

343
00:14:49,276 --> 00:14:51,836
to ask the user to pick from

344
00:14:52,226 --> 00:14:54,576
And Siri calls this

345
00:14:55,056 --> 00:14:57,926
If you'd like to ask the user

346
00:14:58,066 --> 00:15:00,156
we recommend five

347
00:14:58,066 --> 00:15:00,156
we recommend five

348
00:15:00,626 --> 00:15:03,346
You can provide a

349
00:15:03,346 --> 00:15:05,776
And then we'll present the

350
00:15:06,206 --> 00:15:09,126
In the case of this Unicorn Pay

351
00:15:09,126 --> 00:15:10,536
if they meant Sir Buttercup,

352
00:15:10,656 --> 00:15:13,306
Buttercup the Bold,

353
00:15:14,016 --> 00:15:16,866
Now one of the powerful parts

354
00:15:16,866 --> 00:15:20,036
to take care of the interaction

355
00:15:20,036 --> 00:15:21,676
You don't have to

356
00:15:21,676 --> 00:15:24,986
So users can use a

357
00:15:24,986 --> 00:15:26,036
of these options with Siri.

358
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:29,586
They could tap on an item in the

359
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:32,616
and say "Sir Buttercup", or

360
00:15:32,616 --> 00:15:34,336
and simply say, "the

361
00:15:34,806 --> 00:15:37,176
And no matter how the user

362
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:40,126
we're going to take care of that

363
00:15:41,506 --> 00:15:44,976
Now there's other times that

364
00:15:44,976 --> 00:15:45,626
from the user.

365
00:15:45,726 --> 00:15:47,236
Maybe they weren't

366
00:15:47,506 --> 00:15:50,426
or maybe your application has

367
00:15:50,656 --> 00:15:52,276
and you don't want

368
00:15:52,276 --> 00:15:53,426
of Buttercup to the user.

369
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:56,676
In these cases, you can say

370
00:15:57,076 --> 00:15:59,746
and Siri will prompt the

371
00:16:00,236 --> 00:16:01,746
Once the user provides

372
00:16:02,036 --> 00:16:03,546
we'll call the resolve

373
00:16:03,786 --> 00:16:08,896
If the user didn't specify a

374
00:16:08,896 --> 00:16:11,266
to proceed, you can tell

375
00:16:11,716 --> 00:16:13,676
And in this case, we'll

376
00:16:13,846 --> 00:16:15,776
you've got to say something

377
00:16:15,776 --> 00:16:17,796
Unicorn Pay needs to know

378
00:16:19,686 --> 00:16:22,706
You can also tell us that you

379
00:16:22,706 --> 00:16:25,576
user provided, and that you

380
00:16:26,126 --> 00:16:28,006
And for that we have

381
00:16:28,266 --> 00:16:31,046
And just tell us, you don't

382
00:16:31,306 --> 00:16:33,156
and Siri will ask the

383
00:16:34,236 --> 00:16:38,236
And finally, if there's a value

384
00:16:38,236 --> 00:16:41,646
and your app doesn't require it,

385
00:16:41,986 --> 00:16:44,676
We won't prompt the user for

386
00:16:44,676 --> 00:16:47,116
to specify a value,

387
00:16:47,156 --> 00:16:50,326
So those are the resolve steps.

388
00:16:50,556 --> 00:16:54,496
It's how we make sure that

389
00:16:54,606 --> 00:16:57,106
all agree on what they're

390
00:16:57,106 --> 00:16:58,686
to do before we move on.

391
00:17:00,006 --> 00:17:01,706
The next step is confirm.

392
00:17:02,136 --> 00:17:06,046
So the confirm stage is

393
00:17:06,766 --> 00:17:09,346
First, it's a chance

394
00:17:09,496 --> 00:17:12,356
about the expected result

395
00:17:12,935 --> 00:17:14,786
We will want you to

396
00:17:14,786 --> 00:17:17,226
that we can tell the user

397
00:17:18,336 --> 00:17:20,556
It's also an opportunity

398
00:17:20,556 --> 00:17:23,665
to check any required state

399
00:17:23,665 --> 00:17:26,116
to complete the request

400
00:17:27,876 --> 00:17:29,416
Now no matter what, you're going

401
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:32,616
to provide an intent response

402
00:17:32,976 --> 00:17:35,746
and we want you to populate as

403
00:17:36,146 --> 00:17:38,706
in that intent response,

404
00:17:38,706 --> 00:17:40,556
that to the user

405
00:17:41,346 --> 00:17:45,056
And sometimes, Siri is going to

406
00:17:45,056 --> 00:17:48,156
for certain intents and certain

407
00:17:48,156 --> 00:17:49,026
that that's important.

408
00:17:49,256 --> 00:17:52,786
For example, things like sending

409
00:17:53,136 --> 00:17:54,756
are things that Siri's

410
00:17:54,756 --> 00:17:57,406
with the user before we

411
00:17:58,336 --> 00:18:00,006
So let's think about what

412
00:17:58,336 --> 00:18:00,006
So let's think about what

413
00:18:00,236 --> 00:18:01,526
in the Unicorn Pay example.

414
00:18:02,136 --> 00:18:04,566
Now Unicorn Pay has to be

415
00:18:04,906 --> 00:18:07,636
make sure the user signed in,

416
00:18:07,636 --> 00:18:08,896
in order to complete a request.

417
00:18:09,426 --> 00:18:11,916
So we're going to check all

418
00:18:12,506 --> 00:18:15,156
We're going to say, "Can we

419
00:18:16,056 --> 00:18:17,756
Is the user signed

420
00:18:18,386 --> 00:18:21,056
And of course, this is

421
00:18:21,156 --> 00:18:22,806
so we want to make sure

422
00:18:22,806 --> 00:18:24,766
in their account before

423
00:18:25,486 --> 00:18:27,706
Once we've made sure

424
00:18:27,706 --> 00:18:30,856
to handle this request, we

425
00:18:31,336 --> 00:18:34,346
with a success result code,

426
00:18:34,716 --> 00:18:36,126
so we can move onto

427
00:18:37,006 --> 00:18:40,466
And that's the confirm stage

428
00:18:42,146 --> 00:18:43,606
The final step is handle.

429
00:18:44,126 --> 00:18:47,216
And this is the most important

430
00:18:47,636 --> 00:18:49,856
because at this point,

431
00:18:49,856 --> 00:18:51,066
that the user asked you to do.

432
00:18:51,306 --> 00:18:53,596
You're going to perform the

433
00:18:54,576 --> 00:18:56,986
And just like in the

434
00:18:56,986 --> 00:18:58,876
that you provide

435
00:18:58,876 --> 00:19:02,286
as you have available back

436
00:18:58,876 --> 00:19:02,286
as you have available back

437
00:19:02,286 --> 00:19:05,636
of that information so that we

438
00:19:05,636 --> 00:19:08,166
user experience for all

439
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:10,946
Sometimes we're going to display

440
00:19:11,516 --> 00:19:13,596
and other times we're

441
00:19:13,596 --> 00:19:15,966
of the conversation and

442
00:19:16,026 --> 00:19:17,916
so that they understand

443
00:19:20,006 --> 00:19:23,646
Now we understand that sometimes

444
00:19:23,646 --> 00:19:26,346
of time to complete a

445
00:19:26,716 --> 00:19:29,676
Networking calls might take a

446
00:19:29,676 --> 00:19:31,466
on the other end of your

447
00:19:31,466 --> 00:19:33,126
processing transactions

448
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:37,356
While we're waiting for a

449
00:19:37,496 --> 00:19:39,776
were going to show a

450
00:19:39,906 --> 00:19:42,056
and say that your app

451
00:19:42,176 --> 00:19:43,006
their request.

452
00:19:43,996 --> 00:19:46,226
We really would like you

453
00:19:46,356 --> 00:19:48,936
within a few seconds, two

454
00:19:49,576 --> 00:19:52,236
And ideally, you can get

455
00:19:52,236 --> 00:19:53,566
in a very short amount of time.

456
00:19:54,576 --> 00:19:56,746
However, if you know

457
00:19:56,746 --> 00:19:59,396
to take a little while to get

458
00:19:59,956 --> 00:20:02,576
we'd like you to send an

459
00:19:59,956 --> 00:20:02,576
we'd like you to send an

460
00:20:03,186 --> 00:20:05,176
This allows Siri

461
00:20:05,176 --> 00:20:08,446
that your app has received the

462
00:20:08,446 --> 00:20:10,816
as you've told us about, and

463
00:20:10,816 --> 00:20:13,566
to process the request

464
00:20:14,736 --> 00:20:16,726
So in the case of our

465
00:20:17,486 --> 00:20:19,906
as soon as we get the handle

466
00:20:19,906 --> 00:20:21,996
to our servers, we're

467
00:20:22,366 --> 00:20:25,466
and then give Siri an intent

468
00:20:25,466 --> 00:20:28,286
so that Siri can tell the

469
00:20:28,286 --> 00:20:28,806
on the way.

470
00:20:30,546 --> 00:20:32,986
And that's what involved

471
00:20:32,986 --> 00:20:34,926
to your application

472
00:20:35,286 --> 00:20:37,396
We have intents,

473
00:20:37,446 --> 00:20:39,216
that are creating

474
00:20:39,396 --> 00:20:41,326
between your app and Siri.

475
00:20:42,316 --> 00:20:44,736
The next thing we're going to

476
00:20:44,736 --> 00:20:45,976
in adding SiriKit

477
00:20:51,046 --> 00:20:52,656
So with SiriKit in iOS 10,

478
00:20:53,016 --> 00:20:54,966
we're creating two

479
00:20:55,476 --> 00:20:58,626
An intents extension, and

480
00:20:58,816 --> 00:21:01,616
I told you this was

481
00:20:58,816 --> 00:21:01,616
I told you this was

482
00:21:01,746 --> 00:21:03,526
We also are adding some API

483
00:21:03,526 --> 00:21:07,776
to help you help Siri recognize

484
00:21:07,856 --> 00:21:08,766
for your application.

485
00:21:09,346 --> 00:21:10,496
And we're going that in form

486
00:21:10,496 --> 00:21:13,936
of what we call app

487
00:21:14,956 --> 00:21:16,586
I'd like to get started

488
00:21:16,586 --> 00:21:18,376
about the intents extension.

489
00:21:19,256 --> 00:21:21,936
This is what's going to

490
00:21:21,936 --> 00:21:25,356
and handle methods that we

491
00:21:25,496 --> 00:21:29,456
Now, at its core, the intents

492
00:21:29,646 --> 00:21:31,166
fundamental part of SiriKit.

493
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:33,616
This is what we build all

494
00:21:33,616 --> 00:21:36,246
of between Siri and

495
00:21:37,386 --> 00:21:41,086
Your intents extension can

496
00:21:41,496 --> 00:21:43,936
and we leave it up to you to

497
00:21:43,936 --> 00:21:46,886
for your app and how you'd like

498
00:21:47,276 --> 00:21:49,666
Now we encourage you to minimize

499
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:51,886
so that we aren't

500
00:21:51,886 --> 00:21:54,426
if the user makes multiple

501
00:21:54,956 --> 00:21:56,496
But do what makes sense for you.

502
00:21:57,866 --> 00:21:59,436
It's also important to realize,

503
00:21:59,556 --> 00:22:01,536
that your intent

504
00:21:59,556 --> 00:22:01,536
that your intent

505
00:22:01,596 --> 00:22:04,156
in the background while

506
00:22:04,816 --> 00:22:07,906
This allows Siri to maintain

507
00:22:08,276 --> 00:22:10,756
and still talk to your app

508
00:22:10,846 --> 00:22:13,326
and communicate about

509
00:22:14,526 --> 00:22:17,766
And as I mentioned, your intent

510
00:22:17,766 --> 00:22:21,486
the resolve, confirm, and

511
00:22:21,486 --> 00:22:22,736
that your app supports.

512
00:22:24,356 --> 00:22:27,866
Now when we built SiriKit, we

513
00:22:27,866 --> 00:22:30,236
about security, because

514
00:22:30,236 --> 00:22:31,856
to everything we do at Apple.

515
00:22:33,106 --> 00:22:35,666
Part of Siri's built in

516
00:22:35,666 --> 00:22:37,396
to restrict certain behaviors

517
00:22:37,396 --> 00:22:40,446
from being taken while

518
00:22:40,856 --> 00:22:44,026
For example, we wanted to

519
00:22:44,026 --> 00:22:46,636
into their device and unlock

520
00:22:46,986 --> 00:22:48,466
or request a ridesharing

521
00:22:49,266 --> 00:22:52,536
And that's a built in behavior

522
00:22:53,226 --> 00:22:55,716
Now we also understand that

523
00:22:55,716 --> 00:22:58,456
that your app would like to

524
00:22:59,306 --> 00:23:01,366
By default, Siri's

525
00:22:59,306 --> 00:23:01,366
By default, Siri's

526
00:23:01,366 --> 00:23:03,016
like sending messages

527
00:23:03,356 --> 00:23:06,126
but if your app would like to

528
00:23:06,126 --> 00:23:08,696
into their device first, you

529
00:23:08,696 --> 00:23:10,866
like to increase our

530
00:23:11,176 --> 00:23:13,366
and restrict your

531
00:23:13,786 --> 00:23:17,206
And this is simply done

532
00:23:17,416 --> 00:23:18,826
We've also worked to make sure

533
00:23:18,826 --> 00:23:21,076
that the local authentication

534
00:23:21,076 --> 00:23:24,056
for your intent extension,

535
00:23:24,056 --> 00:23:25,556
for additional authentication,

536
00:23:25,956 --> 00:23:27,906
even while the device

537
00:23:28,426 --> 00:23:30,766
If you're not familiar with the

538
00:23:31,046 --> 00:23:33,846
there's a great talk from 2014

539
00:23:34,976 --> 00:23:38,336
And finally, we've made sure

540
00:23:38,336 --> 00:23:39,456
for your intent extension.

541
00:23:39,786 --> 00:23:42,506
So if you'd like to complete

542
00:23:42,506 --> 00:23:44,196
with your users,

543
00:23:44,196 --> 00:23:46,886
to your intent extension and

544
00:23:47,096 --> 00:23:47,966
right above Siri.

545
00:23:47,966 --> 00:23:50,126
If you'd like to

546
00:23:50,296 --> 00:23:51,836
I'm glad someone

547
00:23:51,996 --> 00:23:54,286
I'm excited about it.

548
00:23:54,286 --> 00:23:56,136
You can learn more in the

549
00:23:56,136 --> 00:23:58,436
and Apple Pay talk that

550
00:23:59,476 --> 00:24:01,216
So that's your intent extension.

551
00:23:59,476 --> 00:24:01,216
So that's your intent extension.

552
00:24:01,806 --> 00:24:04,586
This is a fundamental part of

553
00:24:04,586 --> 00:24:08,026
to communicate with your app

554
00:24:09,246 --> 00:24:12,096
The next piece is your

555
00:24:12,096 --> 00:24:13,946
Let's go into a little

556
00:24:14,126 --> 00:24:15,306
about what that's all about.

557
00:24:15,306 --> 00:24:19,836
So the intents UI intent

558
00:24:19,836 --> 00:24:22,676
to bring your app's interface

559
00:24:22,896 --> 00:24:24,576
and make Siri really feel

560
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:27,376
like your users are

561
00:24:27,756 --> 00:24:29,986
You can bring your brand,

562
00:24:29,986 --> 00:24:33,076
as well as other information

563
00:24:33,706 --> 00:24:35,186
And you do that by

564
00:24:35,186 --> 00:24:36,706
to what we call a Siri snippet.

565
00:24:38,056 --> 00:24:40,156
Your intents UI extension

566
00:24:40,156 --> 00:24:42,056
to return a UI view controller.

567
00:24:42,346 --> 00:24:43,546
And you can add anything you'd

568
00:24:43,546 --> 00:24:44,986
like inside that

569
00:24:45,796 --> 00:24:48,816
Now it's completely optional to

570
00:24:49,356 --> 00:24:52,716
By default, Siri has an

571
00:24:52,896 --> 00:24:54,466
that we support in SiriKit.

572
00:24:54,586 --> 00:24:57,456
And we think that those will

573
00:24:57,456 --> 00:25:00,066
of the pieces of information

574
00:24:57,456 --> 00:25:00,066
of the pieces of information

575
00:25:00,386 --> 00:25:03,226
but if you'd like to make a more

576
00:25:03,606 --> 00:25:04,676
this is your opportunity.

577
00:25:05,926 --> 00:25:08,866
We've also made intents

578
00:25:08,866 --> 00:25:09,846
for certain intents.

579
00:25:10,166 --> 00:25:13,066
Where we think it makes sense to

580
00:25:13,436 --> 00:25:15,776
So there's a number

581
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:17,146
with an intents UI extension.

582
00:25:17,806 --> 00:25:20,366
You've used it to show

583
00:25:20,366 --> 00:25:21,986
above and beyond

584
00:25:21,986 --> 00:25:24,026
in the intent and

585
00:25:24,386 --> 00:25:26,696
Maybe some information that's

586
00:25:27,966 --> 00:25:31,216
You can also use it to update

587
00:25:31,216 --> 00:25:32,466
of a long running intent.

588
00:25:32,766 --> 00:25:35,166
So if you've provided an

589
00:25:35,336 --> 00:25:37,576
as we mentioned earlier,

590
00:25:37,576 --> 00:25:40,876
to update the user about

591
00:25:41,176 --> 00:25:42,896
in your intents UI extension.

592
00:25:44,086 --> 00:25:45,946
Now no matter what,

593
00:25:45,946 --> 00:25:49,306
to show your intents UI

594
00:25:49,306 --> 00:25:50,056
Siri content.

595
00:25:50,456 --> 00:25:52,726
So we're always going to

596
00:25:52,916 --> 00:25:54,646
and app name at the

597
00:25:55,106 --> 00:25:57,576
We may choose to show some

598
00:25:57,576 --> 00:25:58,606
at the bottom of the snippet,

599
00:25:58,606 --> 00:26:00,966
as well as other

600
00:25:58,606 --> 00:26:00,966
as well as other

601
00:26:01,446 --> 00:26:04,586
Your view controller is always

602
00:26:06,436 --> 00:26:08,836
Now there's a couple of

603
00:26:08,836 --> 00:26:11,116
for your app to replace

604
00:26:11,116 --> 00:26:12,646
that we're showing

605
00:26:13,246 --> 00:26:16,636
And this is things like

606
00:26:16,636 --> 00:26:18,226
that you should have

607
00:26:18,456 --> 00:26:21,876
to replace the default messaging

608
00:26:21,876 --> 00:26:24,556
that you feel suits your

609
00:26:24,956 --> 00:26:27,936
So you can tell us that your

610
00:26:27,986 --> 00:26:29,336
with your intents UI extension,

611
00:26:29,376 --> 00:26:32,216
and then we will omit certain

612
00:26:32,456 --> 00:26:33,426
in favor of yours.

613
00:26:34,316 --> 00:26:36,546
Now it's also important

614
00:26:36,776 --> 00:26:39,446
that just like the new

615
00:26:39,906 --> 00:26:42,276
intent UI extensions

616
00:26:42,886 --> 00:26:45,486
So you can draw anything you'd

617
00:26:45,486 --> 00:26:47,456
you can play any kind

618
00:26:47,986 --> 00:26:50,686
but we would discourage

619
00:26:50,876 --> 00:26:53,236
in your UI extension,

620
00:26:53,236 --> 00:26:54,056
to interact with them.

621
00:26:54,096 --> 00:26:57,446
So that's the intents

622
00:26:58,086 --> 00:27:01,346
Together these two extension

623
00:26:58,086 --> 00:27:01,346
Together these two extension

624
00:27:01,636 --> 00:27:03,786
to add your app's

625
00:27:03,946 --> 00:27:07,596
and bring your experience and

626
00:27:07,856 --> 00:27:09,956
to make a better experience

627
00:27:11,306 --> 00:27:12,756
The next two parts of SiriKit,

628
00:27:13,076 --> 00:27:14,586
are all part of your

629
00:27:15,146 --> 00:27:16,976
So let's talk about what

630
00:27:22,436 --> 00:27:25,346
Now, all of the responsibilities

631
00:27:25,346 --> 00:27:26,926
in the area of vocabulary.

632
00:27:28,246 --> 00:27:31,166
All of your applications

633
00:27:31,166 --> 00:27:33,756
to your customers, and that

634
00:27:33,756 --> 00:27:35,346
to features of your application.

635
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:37,956
And Siri needs a

636
00:27:38,336 --> 00:27:40,656
in understanding the things

637
00:27:40,656 --> 00:27:42,096
to your app, and the things

638
00:27:42,096 --> 00:27:43,696
that they're accustomed

639
00:27:44,586 --> 00:27:47,256
Some of these phrases are

640
00:27:47,256 --> 00:27:48,666
They're things that every user

641
00:27:48,666 --> 00:27:50,706
of your app knows

642
00:27:51,556 --> 00:27:54,566
Other phrases are going to be

643
00:27:54,696 --> 00:27:56,906
and we have the API to

644
00:27:56,906 --> 00:27:59,076
of SiriKit, and both

645
00:27:59,346 --> 00:28:00,866
to making a great experience.

646
00:27:59,346 --> 00:28:00,866
to making a great experience.

647
00:28:02,076 --> 00:28:04,606
Let's dig into app

648
00:28:05,196 --> 00:28:08,116
These are words or phrases that

649
00:28:08,116 --> 00:28:11,306
and they're known to every

650
00:28:11,766 --> 00:28:14,076
They're things like workout

651
00:28:14,076 --> 00:28:17,546
that everyone uses to refer to

652
00:28:17,546 --> 00:28:21,396
Now because they're part of your

653
00:28:21,396 --> 00:28:24,186
in a plist that's part

654
00:28:24,986 --> 00:28:27,006
And also, because they're

655
00:28:27,476 --> 00:28:28,986
we encourage you

656
00:28:28,986 --> 00:28:31,286
so that they can be

657
00:28:31,286 --> 00:28:33,596
that your app supports,

658
00:28:33,736 --> 00:28:35,036
that Siri's going to be using.

659
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:38,916
Let's talk about what goes

660
00:28:38,916 --> 00:28:41,916
because there's a number of

661
00:28:43,086 --> 00:28:46,246
The first of them, are

662
00:28:46,246 --> 00:28:47,646
to talk to your application.

663
00:28:48,366 --> 00:28:49,666
These are kind of

664
00:28:49,666 --> 00:28:51,296
your hero use cases

665
00:28:51,666 --> 00:28:55,226
In the case of our new Unicorn

666
00:28:55,256 --> 00:28:57,136
like start a workout

667
00:28:57,706 --> 00:28:59,756
The common things that

668
00:29:00,056 --> 00:29:00,866
to talk to your app.

669
00:29:02,006 --> 00:29:04,656
Now in addition to that,

670
00:29:04,836 --> 00:29:07,016
where you can provide

671
00:29:07,016 --> 00:29:09,456
For the Unicorn Fit application,

672
00:29:09,736 --> 00:29:12,496
we're going to specify our

673
00:29:12,786 --> 00:29:16,416
Some things that are unique

674
00:29:16,656 --> 00:29:18,166
but known to all of our users.

675
00:29:18,866 --> 00:29:22,196
Now I'm sure you all are very

676
00:29:22,196 --> 00:29:24,266
but if you're not, now

677
00:29:24,266 --> 00:29:25,666
about the term Colorlicious.

678
00:29:26,046 --> 00:29:28,736
It's a particular workout

679
00:29:28,736 --> 00:29:29,806
where you run around

680
00:29:29,806 --> 00:29:31,496
of falling glitter

681
00:29:31,496 --> 00:29:32,266
It's a great workout.

682
00:29:32,466 --> 00:29:33,296
You should all give it a try.

683
00:29:33,536 --> 00:29:34,216
It's a new craze.

684
00:29:35,216 --> 00:29:37,946
So we're going to tell Siri

685
00:29:37,946 --> 00:29:39,846
It's a unique term for our app.

686
00:29:40,556 --> 00:29:43,466
Now, sometimes these phrases

687
00:29:43,466 --> 00:29:43,976
to pronounce.

688
00:29:43,976 --> 00:29:45,726
They don't look very obvious.

689
00:29:46,436 --> 00:29:48,346
So you're also going

690
00:29:48,346 --> 00:29:49,646
pronunciation information.

691
00:29:50,086 --> 00:29:53,296
And this is just a simple

692
00:29:53,296 --> 00:29:55,006
or phrase that you're

693
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:58,916
And finally, provide some

694
00:29:58,916 --> 00:29:59,976
to use that phrase in your app.

695
00:30:00,736 --> 00:30:03,396
"Do a Colorlicious in Unicorn

696
00:30:03,396 --> 00:30:05,136
of this particular

697
00:30:07,366 --> 00:30:10,836
The other type of vocabulary,

698
00:30:11,516 --> 00:30:13,896
These are words or

699
00:30:13,946 --> 00:30:16,296
to individual users

700
00:30:17,396 --> 00:30:19,986
And because they're unique to

701
00:30:20,366 --> 00:30:22,616
we're asking you to

702
00:30:22,776 --> 00:30:24,296
from your main application.

703
00:30:25,266 --> 00:30:27,236
We ask you to provide

704
00:30:27,236 --> 00:30:29,526
of an ordered set of terms.

705
00:30:30,256 --> 00:30:32,396
Now you might be thinking,

706
00:30:32,396 --> 00:30:33,796
of an odd data structure choice.

707
00:30:33,796 --> 00:30:35,226
Why would we be choosing

708
00:30:35,656 --> 00:30:37,606
Well I promise you there's

709
00:30:38,686 --> 00:30:40,266
We really, we really want you --

710
00:30:40,436 --> 00:30:45,686
we'd encourage you to order

711
00:30:45,966 --> 00:30:48,796
for your users, with the most

712
00:30:48,796 --> 00:30:51,226
that you think users will

713
00:30:51,996 --> 00:30:54,126
Let's talk about that in

714
00:30:54,126 --> 00:30:55,446
where we have an address book

715
00:30:55,446 --> 00:30:57,076
of everyone we can

716
00:30:58,256 --> 00:31:01,196
Now we want you to give Siri

717
00:30:58,256 --> 00:31:01,196
Now we want you to give Siri

718
00:31:01,196 --> 00:31:03,866
in your application, so that

719
00:31:04,136 --> 00:31:05,416
we'll be able to recognize them.

720
00:31:06,386 --> 00:31:09,256
However, Unicorn Pay

721
00:31:09,256 --> 00:31:10,746
that we've paid most recently.

722
00:31:11,136 --> 00:31:13,776
So we're going to put

723
00:31:13,776 --> 00:31:15,696
of all the other contacts

724
00:31:16,936 --> 00:31:20,266
In addition to that, Unicorn

725
00:31:20,706 --> 00:31:22,726
which are the most

726
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:24,796
So we're going to

727
00:31:25,116 --> 00:31:27,336
and start off our ordered

728
00:31:27,816 --> 00:31:30,466
followed by our recent

729
00:31:30,466 --> 00:31:32,366
up with the other

730
00:31:33,006 --> 00:31:34,566
And by prioritizing in this way,

731
00:31:34,986 --> 00:31:37,946
your helping Siri better

732
00:31:38,016 --> 00:31:40,146
and make a better

733
00:31:40,146 --> 00:31:41,406
who uses your app with Siri.

734
00:31:43,066 --> 00:31:44,956
There's a few types of

735
00:31:44,956 --> 00:31:48,066
with user vocabulary, and those

736
00:31:48,386 --> 00:31:51,336
workout names, photo

737
00:31:51,746 --> 00:31:53,976
And as an added benefit

738
00:31:54,386 --> 00:31:58,146
if you rely on the system iOS

739
00:31:58,146 --> 00:32:00,186
to worry about this part

740
00:31:58,146 --> 00:32:00,186
to worry about this part

741
00:32:00,316 --> 00:32:02,136
because Siri has a

742
00:32:02,136 --> 00:32:03,206
of the system address book.

743
00:32:03,446 --> 00:32:05,536
So you only need to

744
00:32:05,836 --> 00:32:07,976
if your app keeps its own

745
00:32:11,196 --> 00:32:14,636
Now, you also should think about

746
00:32:14,636 --> 00:32:17,066
to Siri as part of this

747
00:32:17,256 --> 00:32:19,076
and only tell us

748
00:32:19,416 --> 00:32:21,356
that you your users

749
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:23,026
to recognize and know about.

750
00:32:23,536 --> 00:32:26,046
So we don't want you to give

751
00:32:26,046 --> 00:32:28,476
or e-mail addresses in

752
00:32:28,786 --> 00:32:32,796
Just give us simple common

753
00:32:33,096 --> 00:32:35,746
the things that users would

754
00:32:35,746 --> 00:32:39,696
Now it's important that

755
00:32:40,116 --> 00:32:44,116
as data changes, because users

756
00:32:44,116 --> 00:32:46,536
to Siri the instant they

757
00:32:47,086 --> 00:32:49,266
So for example, if the

758
00:32:49,266 --> 00:32:51,756
in your app, make sure you

759
00:32:51,756 --> 00:32:52,826
as they hit the save button.

760
00:32:53,216 --> 00:32:56,326
That way we can ingest the data,

761
00:32:56,326 --> 00:32:59,246
as soon as users hold down the

762
00:33:00,596 --> 00:33:03,636
It's even more important

763
00:33:03,636 --> 00:33:05,276
from your Siri vocabulary

764
00:33:05,676 --> 00:33:07,606
because your users

765
00:33:07,866 --> 00:33:09,776
if they deleted something

766
00:33:09,986 --> 00:33:12,666
and then Siri was still

767
00:33:12,666 --> 00:33:15,256
or a few weeks later, because

768
00:33:15,256 --> 00:33:17,916
that the user deleted that

769
00:33:19,196 --> 00:33:21,856
And finally, make sure

770
00:33:21,856 --> 00:33:24,716
of your vocabulary data from

771
00:33:24,716 --> 00:33:27,156
to reset your application,

772
00:33:29,346 --> 00:33:32,386
Now the other piece of SiriKit

773
00:33:33,196 --> 00:33:35,276
So like many other parts of iOS,

774
00:33:35,976 --> 00:33:38,296
users have to approve

775
00:33:38,296 --> 00:33:39,706
for your app to talk to Siri.

776
00:33:40,206 --> 00:33:42,456
And we do this through

777
00:33:42,456 --> 00:33:43,656
that you're used to

778
00:33:43,656 --> 00:33:45,496
like the camera,

779
00:33:46,856 --> 00:33:49,816
Now your app is able to

780
00:33:49,816 --> 00:33:52,456
into this alert to

781
00:33:52,456 --> 00:33:55,086
of information your app is

782
00:33:55,656 --> 00:33:59,046
This is also a fantastic

783
00:33:59,046 --> 00:34:00,196
about what your app does,

784
00:33:59,046 --> 00:34:00,196
about what your app does,

785
00:34:00,376 --> 00:34:02,566
and what cool new features

786
00:34:02,566 --> 00:34:04,846
for all of them.

787
00:34:05,036 --> 00:34:08,096
We also are encouraging

788
00:34:08,096 --> 00:34:10,755
from your app the first

789
00:34:10,755 --> 00:34:12,706
after they upgrade to iOS 10.

790
00:34:13,266 --> 00:34:15,996
We want you to do that so

791
00:34:15,996 --> 00:34:17,146
and have approved the use

792
00:34:17,146 --> 00:34:19,706
of Siri before they make

793
00:34:19,706 --> 00:34:22,735
So as soon as they try talking

794
00:34:23,016 --> 00:34:25,216
it's already approved, and

795
00:34:25,216 --> 00:34:25,966
launch experience.

796
00:34:29,156 --> 00:34:30,036
So that's what's involved

797
00:34:30,036 --> 00:34:31,746
in adding SiriKit

798
00:34:32,396 --> 00:34:34,775
These two pieces of extensions,

799
00:34:34,775 --> 00:34:36,726
and two vocabulary mechanisms.

800
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:43,036
The last thing I would like to

801
00:34:43,036 --> 00:34:46,216
into the larger world of iOS.

802
00:34:46,406 --> 00:34:48,795
Now Siri is an integral part

803
00:34:48,966 --> 00:34:52,396
It's always accessible to

804
00:34:52,396 --> 00:34:54,976
via hey Siri, via

805
00:34:54,976 --> 00:34:56,795
and many other ways

806
00:34:57,616 --> 00:34:59,666
And SiriKit is just as integral

807
00:34:59,666 --> 00:35:01,726
to the operating

808
00:34:59,666 --> 00:35:01,726
to the operating

809
00:35:02,876 --> 00:35:07,236
Now Siri integration is part of

810
00:35:07,236 --> 00:35:09,396
that we've created

811
00:35:09,396 --> 00:35:13,416
about communicating these common

812
00:35:13,816 --> 00:35:15,986
between your app and iOS.

813
00:35:15,986 --> 00:35:19,536
And the intense framework

814
00:35:19,536 --> 00:35:20,396
integration this year.

815
00:35:21,226 --> 00:35:22,896
It's part of the

816
00:35:23,106 --> 00:35:25,226
where you can donate

817
00:35:25,566 --> 00:35:29,016
and elevate your application

818
00:35:29,316 --> 00:35:32,086
or telephoning mechanism

819
00:35:33,006 --> 00:35:36,196
We've also done very deep

820
00:35:36,456 --> 00:35:38,046
to make a great VOIP experience.

821
00:35:38,586 --> 00:35:41,426
The most, the biggest

822
00:35:42,296 --> 00:35:45,506
Maps is adding ridesharing

823
00:35:45,506 --> 00:35:48,376
where you can book a ride right

824
00:35:49,146 --> 00:35:51,276
Now we worked very

825
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:53,616
to create a common

826
00:35:53,776 --> 00:35:57,406
This intense extension and

827
00:35:57,406 --> 00:36:01,066
for Siri, and maps, to

828
00:35:57,406 --> 00:36:01,066
for Siri, and maps, to

829
00:36:01,456 --> 00:36:05,676
So if you adopt SiriKit and the

830
00:36:05,676 --> 00:36:07,566
to get the maps integration

831
00:36:08,516 --> 00:36:10,616
We think this is a great

832
00:36:11,126 --> 00:36:13,786
and make an even better

833

[ Applause ]

834
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:23,146
The last part I'd

835
00:36:23,746 --> 00:36:25,486
is how users talk

836
00:36:26,476 --> 00:36:28,496
Now it's very important

837
00:36:28,496 --> 00:36:30,576
and privacy model of iOS

838
00:36:30,576 --> 00:36:33,096
and making your customers

839
00:36:33,096 --> 00:36:36,836
and your data, it's important

840
00:36:36,836 --> 00:36:39,646
they're going to be talking

841
00:36:39,646 --> 00:36:42,566
and when their data

842
00:36:42,866 --> 00:36:45,036
To make sure that all

843
00:36:45,596 --> 00:36:47,976
users are required to

844
00:36:48,496 --> 00:36:50,116
when making a request to Siri.

845
00:36:50,866 --> 00:36:52,396
Specifically, we're

846
00:36:52,396 --> 00:36:53,676
at your bundle display name.

847
00:36:53,866 --> 00:36:55,456
This is what's shown

848
00:36:55,516 --> 00:36:57,396
underneath your app

849
00:36:58,406 --> 00:37:00,286
Now Siri's all about

850
00:36:58,406 --> 00:37:00,286
Now Siri's all about

851
00:37:00,286 --> 00:37:03,646
and having a comfortable fluid

852
00:37:04,536 --> 00:37:06,716
So to make sure that that's

853
00:37:07,126 --> 00:37:10,496
users are able to say your app

854
00:37:10,496 --> 00:37:13,126
at the beginning, or the end

855
00:37:13,516 --> 00:37:16,426
wherever it fits in

856
00:37:16,426 --> 00:37:19,116
to make a natural fluid

857
00:37:19,116 --> 00:37:20,716
to your app, and to your users.

858
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:24,016
One of the common

859
00:37:24,106 --> 00:37:26,886
with SiriKit is what we

860
00:37:27,166 --> 00:37:29,686
or taking your app name

861
00:37:29,856 --> 00:37:31,426
to describe a particular action.

862
00:37:31,946 --> 00:37:33,986
As an example of

863
00:37:34,146 --> 00:37:37,106
"Unicorn Chat Celestra order

864
00:37:37,546 --> 00:37:40,666
And in this case, they're

865
00:37:41,066 --> 00:37:43,116
describing the action

866
00:37:43,116 --> 00:37:46,236
And this will, of course, work

867
00:37:46,946 --> 00:37:49,676
In fact, there's a multitude

868
00:37:49,676 --> 00:37:51,496
to your app using Siri.

869
00:37:51,986 --> 00:37:53,346
The possibilities are endless.

870
00:37:53,346 --> 00:37:55,356
So that's what's involved

871
00:37:55,406 --> 00:37:59,536
in implementing a great Siri

872
00:37:59,916 --> 00:38:02,236
But there's more than just

873
00:37:59,916 --> 00:38:02,236
But there's more than just

874
00:38:02,416 --> 00:38:05,006
involved in creating a

about designing a

[ Applause ]

879
00:38:16,066 --> 00:38:16,446
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

880
00:38:18,616 --> 00:38:19,786
Hello everyone.

881
00:38:19,786 --> 00:38:22,456
I'm Corey Peterson, and

882
00:38:22,836 --> 00:38:25,006
and I'm very excited

883
00:38:25,006 --> 00:38:26,976
about creating magical

884
00:38:32,046 --> 00:38:33,826
I've got three things I

885
00:38:34,886 --> 00:38:37,566
The first is some of the

886
00:38:37,926 --> 00:38:41,116
to help facilitate the

887
00:38:42,266 --> 00:38:45,416
Next, we'll go through

888
00:38:45,416 --> 00:38:48,306
that you should keep in mind as

889
00:38:49,676 --> 00:38:52,646
And then, I'll give a few

890
00:38:52,886 --> 00:38:55,776
to polish the design, and take

891
00:38:56,536 --> 00:39:00,436
So, let's get started

892
00:38:56,536 --> 00:39:00,436
So, let's get started

893
00:39:00,966 --> 00:39:04,016
Now when I say user interface,

894
00:39:04,306 --> 00:39:05,446
about something like this.

895
00:39:07,286 --> 00:39:10,066
A button. Part of

896
00:39:10,486 --> 00:39:11,506
that appears on screen.

897
00:39:11,976 --> 00:39:15,536
Now visual interfaces have

898
00:39:15,536 --> 00:39:16,976
and patterns and

899
00:39:20,096 --> 00:39:22,956
and everyone is pretty

900
00:39:23,496 --> 00:39:24,826
It's part of an application,

901
00:39:25,366 --> 00:39:28,116
and that application gives the

902
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:29,196
the user is trying to do,

903
00:39:30,066 --> 00:39:31,546
the options that

904
00:39:31,546 --> 00:39:33,346
and the details about

905
00:39:33,916 --> 00:39:36,726
And there's pretty much one

906
00:39:37,716 --> 00:39:42,996
But, as you start to work with

907
00:39:42,996 --> 00:39:44,866
and one of the biggest

908
00:39:45,186 --> 00:39:46,996
that button is gone.

909
00:39:48,116 --> 00:39:52,636
Now, it can be -- feel

910
00:39:52,966 --> 00:39:53,466
on a screen.

911
00:39:54,816 --> 00:39:56,496
So how do we solve this?

912
00:39:56,846 --> 00:39:59,186
Because the user could

913
00:39:59,746 --> 00:40:01,286
or they might not

914
00:39:59,746 --> 00:40:01,286
or they might not

915
00:40:02,316 --> 00:40:05,776
So we like to think of it as

916
00:40:06,456 --> 00:40:10,886
The context of what's

917
00:40:10,886 --> 00:40:14,206
through the conversation

918
00:40:14,946 --> 00:40:17,016
Siri, and now your apps.

919
00:40:18,636 --> 00:40:23,106
Now, without a visual reference,

920
00:40:23,106 --> 00:40:24,846
to keep all this

921
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:27,096
So Siri works hard to prevent --

922
00:40:27,236 --> 00:40:30,616
to present just the

923
00:40:30,616 --> 00:40:33,986
to get a task done, and

924
00:40:33,986 --> 00:40:34,926
of the other information.

925
00:40:37,006 --> 00:40:42,376
And, this interface is shaped by

926
00:40:42,726 --> 00:40:44,366
both from the person

927
00:40:45,036 --> 00:40:46,286
And it's important to think

928
00:40:46,286 --> 00:40:49,516
about how Siri asks

929
00:40:49,856 --> 00:40:52,176
And your application

930
00:40:53,076 --> 00:40:54,196
to shape this conversation.

931
00:40:54,196 --> 00:40:56,166
And we'll talk about

932
00:40:57,136 --> 00:41:00,296
So let's go through an

933
00:40:57,136 --> 00:41:00,296
So let's go through an

934
00:41:01,066 --> 00:41:03,206
Let's say, someone

935
00:41:04,106 --> 00:41:05,906
and Siri might say

936
00:41:10,046 --> 00:41:12,736
&gt;&gt; Ready to send it?

937
00:41:12,986 --> 00:41:15,746
&gt;&gt; Now people can say a lot

938
00:41:16,586 --> 00:41:18,516
They might simply say "send it."

939
00:41:19,536 --> 00:41:20,996
Or they might decide not to,

940
00:41:21,796 --> 00:41:24,176
or they might ignore

941
00:41:24,686 --> 00:41:27,076
and say whatever they want.

942
00:41:27,076 --> 00:41:28,256
And that's okay.

943
00:41:28,366 --> 00:41:31,136
These are actually appropriate

944
00:41:31,896 --> 00:41:34,336
And the great thing is, Siri's

945
00:41:34,336 --> 00:41:37,826
for you, and send the right

946
00:41:37,826 --> 00:41:41,076
And even better than that,

947
00:41:41,076 --> 00:41:42,976
of other ways that people

948
00:41:46,126 --> 00:41:51,886
Now earlier, Robby talked

949
00:41:51,886 --> 00:41:53,966
that people can start a

950
00:41:53,966 --> 00:41:56,086
and I'm going to focus

951
00:41:56,726 --> 00:41:58,856
Now everyone's familiar

952
00:41:59,066 --> 00:42:01,646
pressing the home button, and

953
00:41:59,066 --> 00:42:01,646
pressing the home button, and

954
00:42:02,966 --> 00:42:06,626
But, another important mode that

955
00:42:06,966 --> 00:42:07,726
where you don't have

956
00:42:07,726 --> 00:42:10,336
to physically touch the

957
00:42:10,596 --> 00:42:14,846
So just by starting your request

958
00:42:14,846 --> 00:42:22,016
to work from across the room,

959
00:42:22,016 --> 00:42:24,016
if your hands are full, or if

960
00:42:26,046 --> 00:42:27,886
Let me show you a

961
00:42:28,086 --> 00:42:30,566
of how the conversational

962
00:42:31,046 --> 00:42:32,416
to adapt to these situations.

963
00:42:33,446 --> 00:42:36,536
So, here, we're going to say

964
00:42:36,536 --> 00:42:37,296
and pressing the button.

965
00:42:38,706 --> 00:42:42,316
So I'll say, "Do I

966
00:42:43,776 --> 00:42:45,156
&gt;&gt; You have five reminders.

967
00:42:46,176 --> 00:42:49,086
&gt;&gt; So as you heard, Siri

968
00:42:49,126 --> 00:42:51,636
and then gave visual

969
00:42:51,636 --> 00:42:53,876
since I'm holding it and

970
00:42:54,846 --> 00:42:57,976
Now, listen to how this changes

971
00:43:02,046 --> 00:43:04,186
Hey Siri, do I have

972
00:43:05,576 --> 00:43:07,296
&gt;&gt; I found five reminders.

973
00:43:07,636 --> 00:43:12,766
The first one is talk about

974
00:43:12,766 --> 00:43:14,646
to say hi to people

975
00:43:16,246 --> 00:43:18,026
then go to the next slide.

976
00:43:18,026 --> 00:43:19,936
Do you want me to

977
00:43:20,586 --> 00:43:21,256
&gt;&gt; No thanks Siri.

978
00:43:22,156 --> 00:43:24,786
So as you heard, Siri

979
00:43:25,066 --> 00:43:26,766
and it gave a smaller amount

980
00:43:26,766 --> 00:43:29,346
of information that's

981
00:43:29,806 --> 00:43:34,246
And at the end, Siri asks me

982
00:43:34,246 --> 00:43:37,316
in control of the conversation

983
00:43:38,306 --> 00:43:41,366
Now we use these same principles

984
00:43:42,356 --> 00:43:44,896
In car play, where you need

985
00:43:45,056 --> 00:43:50,036
And it's also very helpful for

986
00:43:50,786 --> 00:43:55,166
Now Siri is great because you

987
00:43:55,416 --> 00:43:57,376
and its able to do

988
00:43:57,376 --> 00:44:00,736
to find an application and

989
00:43:57,376 --> 00:44:00,736
to find an application and

990
00:44:00,736 --> 00:44:03,406
to get something done,

991
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:07,006
Siri understands when you have

992
00:44:07,006 --> 00:44:09,436
of headphones, or a

993
00:44:10,426 --> 00:44:13,526
And it adapts what it --

994
00:44:13,526 --> 00:44:15,506
it can recognize settings

995
00:44:15,906 --> 00:44:17,546
which is Apple's

996
00:44:17,546 --> 00:44:19,256
out the visual elements

997
00:44:20,546 --> 00:44:22,756
And it again, adapts

998
00:44:22,756 --> 00:44:27,626
to help these users

999
00:44:27,626 --> 00:44:30,236
So, that's a little bit

1000
00:44:30,396 --> 00:44:32,646
Here's a couple things that

1001
00:44:34,096 --> 00:44:36,786
Make sure that you're testing,

1002
00:44:37,146 --> 00:44:37,976
with many different requests.

1003
00:44:40,646 --> 00:44:43,846
Testing different

1004
00:44:43,846 --> 00:44:45,136
out things hands free.

1005
00:44:47,336 --> 00:44:49,066
And throughout the process,

1006
00:44:49,276 --> 00:44:52,156
make sure that your app is

1007
00:44:52,156 --> 00:44:55,386
to Siri so that Siri can

1008
00:44:56,456 --> 00:44:59,786
And that's especially critical

1009
00:45:01,576 --> 00:45:04,976
All right, let's move on

1010
00:45:13,316 --> 00:45:14,886
And I want you to think of this

1011
00:45:14,886 --> 00:45:17,176
as a conversation

1012
00:45:17,746 --> 00:45:19,486
And as with any important

1013
00:45:19,766 --> 00:45:23,326
you need to make sure that

1014
00:45:24,456 --> 00:45:28,556
that you ask questions, and

1015
00:45:29,386 --> 00:45:31,156
So, how do we prepare?

1016
00:45:32,256 --> 00:45:34,456
The first thing is to recognize

1017
00:45:35,036 --> 00:45:37,576
that your users aren't

1018
00:45:38,066 --> 00:45:40,076
Now, what do I mean by that?

1019
00:45:40,806 --> 00:45:44,026
You've spent a huge

1020
00:45:44,026 --> 00:45:47,406
and designing your application,

1021
00:45:47,406 --> 00:45:50,186
of knowledge that's greater

1022
00:45:50,186 --> 00:45:52,156
with it, and that's going

1023
00:45:52,156 --> 00:45:54,006
to influence how you

1024
00:45:55,006 --> 00:46:00,216
So, you need to go out and find

1025
00:45:55,006 --> 00:46:00,216
So, you need to go out and find

1026
00:46:00,366 --> 00:46:02,846
significant others, or maybe

1027
00:46:03,626 --> 00:46:05,996
and ask them what

1028
00:46:08,266 --> 00:46:13,476
So I'm going to go with

1029
00:46:13,476 --> 00:46:17,496
and talk about an

1030
00:46:18,506 --> 00:46:20,936
So for this fake

1031
00:46:20,936 --> 00:46:25,166
to some real users and they

1032
00:46:25,606 --> 00:46:29,116
Some people might say "Get

1033
00:46:29,426 --> 00:46:32,816
Siri is going to ask the user

1034
00:46:32,816 --> 00:46:37,876
to use, and then can continue

1035
00:46:38,046 --> 00:46:39,956
Some people may provide

1036
00:46:40,686 --> 00:46:43,516
and some people may provide

1037
00:46:43,996 --> 00:46:45,566
some of which may

1038
00:46:46,146 --> 00:46:48,776
because as we all know,

1039
00:46:48,776 --> 00:46:49,976
than two people on a Pegasus.

1040
00:46:54,046 --> 00:46:55,536
Once you have all

1041
00:46:56,996 --> 00:46:59,386
make sure that your

1042
00:47:00,006 --> 00:47:02,826
Take all of the information

1043
00:47:02,826 --> 00:47:05,666
and use that, but they

1044
00:47:05,666 --> 00:47:06,916
of the information

1045
00:47:07,566 --> 00:47:09,496
So, you need to find

1046
00:47:10,076 --> 00:47:11,886
One way, is to pick

1047
00:47:12,626 --> 00:47:15,486
so if I were requesting

1048
00:47:15,486 --> 00:47:18,786
where to be picked up, Unicorn

1049
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:20,816
that I probably want to

1050
00:47:21,296 --> 00:47:23,676
or maybe outside the

1051
00:47:25,496 --> 00:47:28,856
You can also make educated

1052
00:47:28,856 --> 00:47:33,826
about the user, but

1053
00:47:34,576 --> 00:47:36,616
You don't want to pick

1054
00:47:36,616 --> 00:47:41,136
or some other default, or some

1055
00:47:41,136 --> 00:47:42,236
to be unhappy with later.

1056
00:47:43,106 --> 00:47:44,786
So if you have questions

1057
00:47:44,786 --> 00:47:48,376
if someone would be unhappy,

1058
00:47:48,376 --> 00:47:50,406
to ask the question to the user.

1059
00:47:51,806 --> 00:47:55,096
But, with this, you need to

1060
00:47:55,626 --> 00:47:58,376
Nobody wants to play a game of

1061
00:47:58,376 --> 00:47:59,126
to get something done.

1062
00:47:59,966 --> 00:48:03,886
So, only ask for the things

1063
00:47:59,966 --> 00:48:03,886
So, only ask for the things

1064
00:48:04,926 --> 00:48:06,876
And people may provide

1065
00:48:07,436 --> 00:48:08,566
that your app can't handle,

1066
00:48:08,946 --> 00:48:11,656
so you need to send

1067
00:48:12,006 --> 00:48:13,716
so that Siri can

1068
00:48:13,866 --> 00:48:18,056
and try to move forward

1069
00:48:18,056 --> 00:48:22,486
There are two types of questions

1070
00:48:23,046 --> 00:48:24,456
and Brandon talked

1071
00:48:25,036 --> 00:48:26,236
The first is confirmation.

1072
00:48:26,936 --> 00:48:30,686
And this is great when you

1073
00:48:30,686 --> 00:48:31,556
to check with the user.

1074
00:48:32,026 --> 00:48:37,426
And this could happen because

1075
00:48:37,546 --> 00:48:41,186
or if there's an item that

1076
00:48:41,966 --> 00:48:45,266
So if someone is used to

1077
00:48:45,266 --> 00:48:48,676
or small payments

1078
00:48:48,676 --> 00:48:50,966
and suddenly they make a payment

1079
00:48:51,166 --> 00:48:52,556
you may want to confirm

1080
00:48:52,716 --> 00:48:53,646
to make sure it's

1081
00:48:55,926 --> 00:48:57,616
The next is disambiguation.

1082
00:48:58,076 --> 00:49:01,576
And this is great when

1083
00:48:58,076 --> 00:49:01,576
And this is great when

1084
00:49:01,716 --> 00:49:02,936
and you need the

1085
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:07,086
So this can be used when

1086
00:49:07,256 --> 00:49:10,686
such as the available ride

1087
00:49:11,656 --> 00:49:15,376
Or, if you have a much

1088
00:49:15,376 --> 00:49:19,516
to send a message to Eric,

1089
00:49:19,516 --> 00:49:22,016
in my contacts, I

1090
00:49:22,286 --> 00:49:24,236
to just the possible

1091
00:49:24,236 --> 00:49:25,926
and let the user pick that.

1092
00:49:26,956 --> 00:49:31,866
Siri can present this list both

1093
00:49:31,866 --> 00:49:35,976
And the user can respond by

1094
00:49:39,546 --> 00:49:43,106
So before you perform

1095
00:49:43,106 --> 00:49:46,426
with your extension, to make

1096
00:49:47,326 --> 00:49:49,826
And it wants to get all

1097
00:49:50,206 --> 00:49:54,326
from your extension, so that it

1098
00:49:56,546 --> 00:50:00,006
Now, again, Siri will

1099
00:49:56,546 --> 00:50:00,006
Now, again, Siri will

1100
00:50:00,006 --> 00:50:02,976
and it will provide a UI on

1101
00:50:03,046 --> 00:50:05,976
If the user decides to continue,

1102
00:50:10,136 --> 00:50:11,896
if the user decides to continue,

1103
00:50:12,386 --> 00:50:14,646
you should go perform

1104
00:50:14,916 --> 00:50:19,336
return those results back to

1105
00:50:19,336 --> 00:50:20,826
to the user and tell the user.

1106
00:50:21,196 --> 00:50:23,976
And in the same way that

1107
00:50:24,136 --> 00:50:28,506
they started in a conversation

1108
00:50:28,506 --> 00:50:29,736
in the conversation as well.

1109
00:50:31,236 --> 00:50:33,956
The great thing about that,

1110
00:50:34,346 --> 00:50:37,666
It works in car play, it

1111
00:50:37,666 --> 00:50:39,036
when somebody's touching

1112
00:50:40,866 --> 00:50:44,726
And Siri will again, provide

1113
00:50:46,866 --> 00:50:48,666
But, if you want,

1114
00:50:49,416 --> 00:50:52,906
your application can provide

1115
00:50:52,906 --> 00:50:54,546
of your app into Siri.

1116
00:50:54,816 --> 00:51:00,666
I want you to exercise restraint

1117
00:50:54,816 --> 00:51:00,666
I want you to exercise restraint

1118
00:51:01,526 --> 00:51:04,186
The person is trying to get a

1119
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:05,086
to distract them

1120
00:51:05,166 --> 00:51:08,226
with information

1121
00:51:08,416 --> 00:51:10,856
You also need to make sure

1122
00:51:10,856 --> 00:51:14,396
for different screen sizes,

1123
00:51:14,396 --> 00:51:14,976
up to the biggest iPad.

1124
00:51:19,376 --> 00:51:21,136
Here's another example

1125
00:51:21,136 --> 00:51:22,976
from our Unicorn

1126
00:51:28,126 --> 00:51:30,726
And as Brandon said,

1127
00:51:30,726 --> 00:51:33,006
to hide any redundant

1128
00:51:35,046 --> 00:51:37,206
As you do so, you

1129
00:51:37,206 --> 00:51:39,706
that your custom UI

1130
00:51:40,456 --> 00:51:43,326
and that you send all the

1131
00:51:43,826 --> 00:51:45,936
so that hands free

1132
00:51:46,116 --> 00:51:47,216
when they can't see this UI.

1133
00:51:49,396 --> 00:51:53,346
In a few cases, Siri will

1134
00:51:53,516 --> 00:51:55,596
to finish a request,

1135
00:51:55,596 --> 00:51:57,496
that for a photo search request

1136
00:51:57,676 --> 00:51:59,456
where we can show the

1137
00:51:59,806 --> 00:52:01,876
And this is great because

1138
00:51:59,806 --> 00:52:01,876
And this is great because

1139
00:52:01,876 --> 00:52:02,886
follow-up actions.

1140
00:52:03,596 --> 00:52:07,266
Now anytime a user goes

1141
00:52:07,896 --> 00:52:09,136
you don't want to surprise them.

1142
00:52:09,536 --> 00:52:12,216
Don't put any interstitial

1143
00:52:12,216 --> 00:52:14,066
in the way, and make sure

1144
00:52:14,066 --> 00:52:16,976
that you are only performing the

1145
00:52:19,116 --> 00:52:21,596
Okay, next, let's

1146
00:52:22,006 --> 00:52:22,976
about polishing your design.

1147
00:52:30,166 --> 00:52:33,966
So, earlier Brandon talked about

1148
00:52:34,216 --> 00:52:35,686
and the examples

1149
00:52:36,566 --> 00:52:39,776
And people can find that

1150
00:52:40,516 --> 00:52:46,136
and just asking,

1151
00:52:46,266 --> 00:52:49,196
Siri will show lots of

1152
00:52:49,196 --> 00:52:52,726
including your applications, and

1153
00:52:53,696 --> 00:52:55,476
So I want to give you

1154
00:52:55,476 --> 00:52:56,706
to write good examples.

1155
00:52:56,706 --> 00:53:00,056
Make sure that your examples

1156
00:52:56,706 --> 00:53:00,056
Make sure that your examples

1157
00:53:00,296 --> 00:53:03,586
so that people can get to your

1158
00:53:04,896 --> 00:53:09,636
Keep your examples short, and

1159
00:53:09,856 --> 00:53:12,766
You should provide multiple

1160
00:53:12,766 --> 00:53:14,526
that you support, and make sure

1161
00:53:14,526 --> 00:53:16,396
that you prioritize

1162
00:53:16,526 --> 00:53:18,626
and the examples

1163
00:53:20,746 --> 00:53:23,816
If your app works in multiple

1164
00:53:24,586 --> 00:53:26,716
make sure that you

1165
00:53:26,716 --> 00:53:28,706
in the appropriate places.

1166
00:53:30,806 --> 00:53:33,786
And most importantly,

1167
00:53:35,376 --> 00:53:36,886
A couple things to avoid.

1168
00:53:37,366 --> 00:53:41,476
You don't need to address

1169
00:53:42,406 --> 00:53:45,546
and you also don't need any

1170
00:53:45,986 --> 00:53:50,396
Just focus on the

1171
00:53:50,546 --> 00:53:52,456
And the last thing I

1172
00:53:52,796 --> 00:53:54,516
is iterating on the experience.

1173
00:53:55,216 --> 00:53:58,456
You want to make sure that

1174
00:53:58,616 --> 00:54:01,976
and to experiment in how

1175
00:53:58,616 --> 00:54:01,976
and to experiment in how

1176
00:54:04,676 --> 00:54:06,666
Make sure that you

1177
00:54:07,126 --> 00:54:08,766
not just what they

1178
00:54:08,956 --> 00:54:12,266
but throughout the process

1179
00:54:13,876 --> 00:54:17,206
And again, try it in different

1180
00:54:18,156 --> 00:54:20,686
or out and about, not

1181
00:54:22,606 --> 00:54:23,646
And throughout, make sure

1182
00:54:23,646 --> 00:54:25,796
that you are asking,

1183
00:54:25,796 --> 00:54:29,866
If you need to, make a

1184
00:54:30,796 --> 00:54:33,876
because we want to

1185
00:54:34,226 --> 00:54:37,406
where you have a great Siri

1186
00:54:39,266 --> 00:54:44,216
So, let's recap what

1187
00:54:44,376 --> 00:54:49,166
Robby started us out introducing

1188
00:54:49,166 --> 00:54:53,776
of Siri and your applications to

1189
00:54:55,146 --> 00:54:57,606
Brandon talked about

1190
00:54:57,606 --> 00:55:01,036
and the way they communicate

1191
00:54:57,606 --> 00:55:01,036
and the way they communicate

1192
00:55:01,196 --> 00:55:04,606
and intent responses,

1193
00:55:04,916 --> 00:55:08,356
of resolve, confirm, and handle.

1194
00:55:09,566 --> 00:55:13,376
And also that your apps

1195
00:55:13,786 --> 00:55:16,426
of the common things that

1196
00:55:17,616 --> 00:55:19,276
And then we talked about design.

1197
00:55:19,916 --> 00:55:21,926
Introducing the conversational

1198
00:55:22,516 --> 00:55:23,886
the conversational interface,

1199
00:55:24,616 --> 00:55:27,246
and talking about the

1200
00:55:27,246 --> 00:55:28,746
as you're developing

1201
00:55:29,196 --> 00:55:31,836
that will shape the

1202
00:55:33,076 --> 00:55:39,436
And last we talked about

1203
00:55:39,436 --> 00:55:44,096
to a Siri experience that

1204
00:55:44,786 --> 00:55:47,276
We have more information

1205
00:55:49,416 --> 00:55:51,546
We have some related

1206
00:55:51,996 --> 00:55:55,776
and I want to especially

1207
00:55:55,776 --> 00:55:57,596
with SiriKit, which is tomorrow,

1208
00:55:58,056 --> 00:56:01,526
where some of our colleagues

1209
00:55:58,056 --> 00:56:01,526
where some of our colleagues

1210
00:56:01,526 --> 00:56:03,556
about the API and

1211
00:56:03,556 --> 00:56:05,476
for an example integration

1212
00:56:06,506 --> 00:56:08,396
So thank you very

1213
00:56:08,396 --> 00:56:08,956
to see what you create.

1214
00:56:09,516 --> 00:56:14,500
