&gt;&gt; Good afternoon.

00:00:40,786 --> 00:00:43,236
Welcome to "iMessage Apps

5
00:00:44,006 --> 00:00:46,776
My name's Alex and with me today

6
00:00:46,776 --> 00:00:47,796
He's going to do the demos.

7
00:00:49,226 --> 00:00:51,526
So, in the first part

8
00:00:51,526 --> 00:00:54,876
and Lily introduced

9
00:00:54,966 --> 00:00:56,876
and simple iMessage apps focused

00:00:56,946 --> 00:00:59,386
on providing sticker

00:01:01,976 --> 00:01:05,105
Today we're going to talk

12
00:01:05,146 --> 00:01:07,376
and we're going to dive

13
00:01:07,376 --> 00:01:08,356
and the Messages framework.

14
00:01:10,216 --> 00:01:12,526
So, what are interactive

15
00:01:13,776 --> 00:01:15,966
Well, you can see one

16
00:01:15,966 --> 00:01:17,146
in the Messages transcript.

17
00:01:18,926 --> 00:01:21,826
This is a special type of

18
00:01:21,826 --> 00:01:25,926
by a Messages extension and

19
00:01:25,926 --> 00:01:27,226
in the screenshot highlighted.

20
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:34,836
Messages extensions

21
00:01:34,836 --> 00:01:38,776
to compose interactive messages

22
00:01:38,776 --> 00:01:41,766
to insert them on the

23
00:01:43,006 --> 00:01:48,186
They also allow a user to

24
00:01:48,186 --> 00:01:50,976
by tapping one in the transcript

25
00:01:51,366 --> 00:01:54,046
and in this point an extension

26
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:54,816
as shown here.

27
00:01:54,816 --> 00:02:00,866
The user can interact with this

28
00:01:54,816 --> 00:02:00,866
The user can interact with this

29
00:02:00,866 --> 00:02:05,866
Your extension can then

30
00:02:06,806 --> 00:02:08,895
into the messages and it will

31
00:02:08,895 --> 00:02:11,656
and the user can send it.

32
00:02:12,056 --> 00:02:14,316
So, now we're going to

33
00:02:14,316 --> 00:02:16,196
and he's going to show

34
00:02:16,196 --> 00:02:16,956
in the simulator.

that I've written to demo all

38
00:02:31,916 --> 00:02:32,906
to learn in today's session.

39
00:02:33,626 --> 00:02:35,776
If you look here in the

40
00:02:35,976 --> 00:02:37,506
from my iMessage app

41
00:02:38,856 --> 00:02:42,086
When I tap this, my iMessage

42
00:02:42,136 --> 00:02:43,576
within the context of Messages.

00:02:44,486 --> 00:02:47,506
All of the UI with this

44
00:02:47,686 --> 00:02:49,336
is UI provided by my extension.

45
00:02:50,696 --> 00:02:53,266
Now, my iMessage app is

00:03:09,946 --> 00:03:13,236
If I choose an ice cream cone,

Now, on iOS 10, we've

00:03:23,466 --> 00:03:26,206
for you to develop and test

57
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:26,966
within the simulator.

58
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,936
If you go back to the

59
00:03:30,596 --> 00:03:33,516
you'll see two ends of a

60
00:03:35,186 --> 00:03:38,506
Tapping the second one shows

61
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:44,086
When I tap this, my iMessage app

62
00:03:44,086 --> 00:03:45,346
in the ice cream

63
00:03:46,146 --> 00:03:47,966
I can select my favorite

64
00:03:49,606 --> 00:03:52,076
stage that message, and send it.

65
00:03:54,016 --> 00:03:57,086
Now, if I go back to that first

66
00:03:57,086 --> 00:03:59,826
of the conversation

67
00:04:00,986 --> 00:04:03,276
and select the final part of

68
00:04:05,486 --> 00:04:08,766
and send it, I now have

69
00:04:09,336 --> 00:04:09,906
that I've built.

70
00:04:10,536 --> 00:04:13,526
In fact, now when I go

71
00:04:14,686 --> 00:04:17,536
you'll see that it appears

72
00:04:17,805 --> 00:04:20,935
as a sticker that I can then

73
00:04:22,236 --> 00:04:23,756
And that's a quick

74
00:04:23,756 --> 00:04:24,756
with interactive messages.

of the features of

00:04:36,986 --> 00:04:41,426
So, let's talk about how we can

81
00:04:41,976 --> 00:04:43,326
I'm going to go through

82
00:04:44,466 --> 00:04:47,266
One of them-- so I'm going

83
00:04:47,266 --> 00:04:50,246
of the API followed by

84
00:04:50,246 --> 00:04:51,706
into the extension lifecycle.

85
00:04:52,696 --> 00:04:56,546
Number three, we're

86
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:58,686
to compose a message

87
00:04:59,156 --> 00:05:01,476
Number four, we're going

88
00:04:59,156 --> 00:05:01,476
Number four, we're going

89
00:05:01,476 --> 00:05:02,816
about how the message is sent.

90
00:05:04,206 --> 00:05:06,736
So, starting with

91
00:05:08,796 --> 00:05:10,806
We have our iMessage

92
00:05:10,806 --> 00:05:15,126
shown in compact presentation

93
00:05:15,696 --> 00:05:17,436
Extensions have a

94
00:05:17,476 --> 00:05:19,946
and for iMessage apps

95
00:05:19,946 --> 00:05:22,236
of the

96
00:05:22,236 --> 00:05:23,836
Now, ultimately,

97
00:05:23,836 --> 00:05:26,516
the MSMessagesAppViewController

98
00:05:26,516 --> 00:05:29,436
of UIViewController, so it's

99
00:05:29,436 --> 00:05:34,436
Above the extension, we

100
00:05:35,026 --> 00:05:37,376
and specifically the

101
00:05:38,456 --> 00:05:42,136
This is represented in our API

102
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:45,916
And finally we have

103
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:47,696
We have this bubble

104
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:51,196
and this is represented

105
00:05:52,106 --> 00:05:55,096
Also, you'll note in this slide

106
00:05:55,096 --> 00:05:58,536
shown, the MSSession and

107
00:05:58,836 --> 00:06:01,426
These provide some control

These provide some control

109
00:06:01,726 --> 00:06:03,736
and how the message

110
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:10,406
So, let's move on and talk about

111
00:06:10,406 --> 00:06:17,086
Here we have a timeline and

112
00:06:18,126 --> 00:06:22,466
perhaps from the app drawer,

113
00:06:25,346 --> 00:06:28,246
Shortly afterwards, we'll

114
00:06:28,276 --> 00:06:30,176
with conversation and

115
00:06:30,176 --> 00:06:31,316
in a conversation object

116
00:06:31,316 --> 00:06:33,896
that represents the conversation

117
00:06:33,896 --> 00:06:37,476
And since this is a

118
00:06:37,476 --> 00:06:40,816
we'll also call will--

119
00:06:41,906 --> 00:06:43,756
as your extension

120
00:06:45,756 --> 00:06:47,666
Now, what happens

121
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:48,696
is removed from the screen?

122
00:06:48,696 --> 00:06:51,096
We're going to call

123
00:06:51,096 --> 00:06:54,646
and what happens is first you

124
00:06:55,286 --> 00:06:57,666
viewDidDisappear calls

125
00:06:58,836 --> 00:07:01,086
This is followed by

126
00:06:58,836 --> 00:07:01,086
This is followed by

127
00:07:01,326 --> 00:07:01,926
this is followed

128
00:07:01,926 --> 00:07:04,716
by a willResignActive

129
00:07:05,116 --> 00:07:08,016
At this point, we're about

130
00:07:08,016 --> 00:07:10,206
between Messages

131
00:07:10,976 --> 00:07:13,076
So, this is the last time

132
00:07:13,076 --> 00:07:14,016
with the conversation.

133
00:07:14,216 --> 00:07:17,466
And then at some point later

134
00:07:17,796 --> 00:07:20,786
and this-- just to stress-- is

135
00:07:20,786 --> 00:07:23,606
on extensions and extensions

136
00:07:23,606 --> 00:07:25,236
and they're terminated

137
00:07:26,396 --> 00:07:32,516
So, let's see now that we have

138
00:07:32,516 --> 00:07:36,656
within Messages, your user is

139
00:07:36,656 --> 00:07:38,556
and build a message and

140
00:07:38,556 --> 00:07:40,166
to deal with that in our API.

141
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:41,856
Well, the first thing

142
00:07:41,856 --> 00:07:44,986
to do is create an MSMessage

143
00:07:44,986 --> 00:07:46,576
to set some properties

144
00:07:47,096 --> 00:07:50,816
In this case, I'm

145
00:07:50,816 --> 00:07:54,486
so the message is URL property

146
00:07:54,486 --> 00:07:55,966
about the ice cream

147
00:07:55,966 --> 00:07:57,796
in the query string of that URL.

148
00:07:57,796 --> 00:08:00,676
The only platform that is

149
00:07:57,796 --> 00:08:00,676
The only platform that is

150
00:08:00,936 --> 00:08:04,386
these messages is iOS, but

151
00:08:04,676 --> 00:08:06,386
to macOS and to watchOS.

152
00:08:08,106 --> 00:08:09,806
When they're delivered on

153
00:08:09,806 --> 00:08:12,336
in full fidelity in the

154
00:08:12,336 --> 00:08:15,986
and clicking on a message

155
00:08:15,986 --> 00:08:18,276
and get this URL and open

156
00:08:18,746 --> 00:08:23,586
So, if you provide an https URL

157
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:27,286
to show-- should be able

158
00:08:27,286 --> 00:08:30,136
of the message for

159
00:08:30,696 --> 00:08:32,846
Moving on, we have an

160
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:33,466
property here.

161
00:08:33,966 --> 00:08:36,616
This is used by screen readers

162
00:08:37,226 --> 00:08:39,126
So, I'm setting this

163
00:08:39,126 --> 00:08:41,176
of the message bubble

164
00:08:41,176 --> 00:08:43,566
who use screen readers get

165
00:08:43,616 --> 00:08:46,766
of the bubble as it is

166
00:08:47,566 --> 00:08:50,836
And finally I'm going to talk

167
00:08:50,836 --> 00:08:54,576
And I'm going to talk about this

168
00:08:55,156 --> 00:08:59,596
The layout object is how

169
00:09:00,116 --> 00:09:01,436
of a message in the transcript.

170
00:09:01,956 --> 00:09:03,426
Right now we only

171
00:09:03,426 --> 00:09:05,766
and that's the

172
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:08,246
We can set some properties

173
00:09:08,246 --> 00:09:10,236
and this affects how

174
00:09:11,456 --> 00:09:13,596
So, right here we

175
00:09:13,596 --> 00:09:16,626
and this takes a UI image

176
00:09:16,626 --> 00:09:18,036
for the area highlighted

177
00:09:19,626 --> 00:09:21,726
We also have a mediaFileURL

178
00:09:22,376 --> 00:09:26,456
The mediaFileURL also provides

179
00:09:26,456 --> 00:09:29,566
as the image, but here you

180
00:09:29,566 --> 00:09:30,796
supported by UI image.

181
00:09:31,056 --> 00:09:33,806
For instance, you could provide

182
00:09:34,176 --> 00:09:36,386
A short video would be then

183
00:09:36,386 --> 00:09:38,056
of the message bubble

184
00:09:38,656 --> 00:09:41,046
Let's take a second to

185
00:09:41,046 --> 00:09:42,026
on these two properties.

186
00:09:42,866 --> 00:09:46,176
We should note first

187
00:09:46,396 --> 00:09:49,276
and the URL are both provided,

188
00:09:49,276 --> 00:09:51,266
to take precedence over the URL.

189
00:09:51,266 --> 00:09:56,256
We had some recommended--

190
00:09:56,256 --> 00:09:58,446
of the assets provided

191
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:01,156
We're recommending that

192
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:01,156
We're recommending that

193
00:10:01,156 --> 00:10:03,646
at roughly 300 point

194
00:10:04,116 --> 00:10:06,396
You can provide slightly

195
00:10:06,396 --> 00:10:08,516
and slightly smaller assets

196
00:10:08,516 --> 00:10:11,956
to experiment with asset

197
00:10:11,956 --> 00:10:14,946
to find what best suits

198
00:10:16,046 --> 00:10:19,616
All of these assets, as with

199
00:10:19,856 --> 00:10:23,376
and Messages will downsample

200
00:10:23,376 --> 00:10:25,626
when they arrive on other

201
00:10:25,626 --> 00:10:28,416
for the screen resolution on

202
00:10:28,996 --> 00:10:35,446
In the mediaFileURL, we support

203
00:10:35,836 --> 00:10:37,736
When I say video,

204
00:10:37,736 --> 00:10:39,976
that we support any

205
00:10:39,976 --> 00:10:42,506
with our media player frameworks

206
00:10:42,506 --> 00:10:44,346
to the media player

207
00:10:44,346 --> 00:10:47,066
to find out more about this.

208
00:10:48,236 --> 00:10:49,496
The other thing that

209
00:10:49,496 --> 00:10:50,906
with this media is we're going

210
00:10:50,906 --> 00:10:52,646
to transcode the assets

211
00:10:52,946 --> 00:10:54,336
This is in order

212
00:10:54,336 --> 00:10:55,826
for transfer over our networks.

213
00:10:56,386 --> 00:11:00,436
And finally I'd like

214
00:10:56,386 --> 00:11:00,436
And finally I'd like

215
00:11:00,436 --> 00:11:02,986
to avoid rendering

216
00:11:04,376 --> 00:11:07,186
As I said, these images

217
00:11:07,186 --> 00:11:10,496
on devices with 1x and 2x

218
00:11:10,496 --> 00:11:12,136
to provide them at 3x.

219
00:11:12,556 --> 00:11:14,286
If you were to render

220
00:11:14,286 --> 00:11:17,666
particularly small text, when

221
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:21,686
the text could be rendered

222
00:11:21,686 --> 00:11:24,796
that we actually do show in this

223
00:11:24,796 --> 00:11:27,946
of the image, so let's

224
00:11:28,126 --> 00:11:29,426
without degrading quality.

225
00:11:30,676 --> 00:11:34,586
The layout has some additional

226
00:11:34,586 --> 00:11:37,566
the two that provide images--

227
00:11:38,746 --> 00:11:42,906
They're transformatted with

228
00:11:42,906 --> 00:11:45,656
on the receiving devices

229
00:11:46,146 --> 00:11:49,866
on the receiving devices as

230
00:11:50,546 --> 00:11:52,976
We have here shown

231
00:11:52,976 --> 00:11:55,756
and this is text that's

232
00:11:56,386 --> 00:11:57,586
in the lower left hand corner.

233
00:11:59,016 --> 00:12:02,476
We have an image subtitle that's

234
00:11:59,016 --> 00:12:02,476
We have an image subtitle that's

235
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:04,566
right below the image

236
00:12:04,566 --> 00:12:06,566
And we have these

237
00:12:06,566 --> 00:12:09,406
and these are drawn below

238
00:12:09,476 --> 00:12:10,876
That's this gray area onscreen.

239
00:12:11,296 --> 00:12:16,996
So, we have caption,

240
00:12:17,046 --> 00:12:20,206
and trailing subcaption.

241
00:12:20,766 --> 00:12:29,786
Now, if you look at the caption

242
00:12:29,786 --> 00:12:33,596
to omit these altogether

243
00:12:34,466 --> 00:12:36,986
If you do that, then

244
00:12:36,986 --> 00:12:38,926
that doesn't have the

245
00:12:38,996 --> 00:12:40,546
and it'll look something

246
00:12:41,686 --> 00:12:43,896
And one last thing to

247
00:12:44,746 --> 00:12:47,536
We have an icon in the top

248
00:12:48,026 --> 00:12:50,786
This icon is provided and

249
00:12:50,786 --> 00:12:53,116
of your content and

250
00:12:53,116 --> 00:12:57,886
to be the iMessage app icon of

251
00:12:59,836 --> 00:13:03,116
So, let's move on now and talk

252
00:12:59,836 --> 00:13:03,116
So, let's move on now and talk

253
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:03,996
that we've constructed.

254
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:08,426
To do that, we're going to need

255
00:13:08,426 --> 00:13:10,356
to get an MSConversation

256
00:13:10,856 --> 00:13:12,866
You can get this from

257
00:13:12,866 --> 00:13:14,066
active conversation.

258
00:13:15,316 --> 00:13:16,746
Once you have a conversation,

259
00:13:17,206 --> 00:13:18,716
you can call the

260
00:13:19,066 --> 00:13:21,916
pass the message you

261
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:23,526
that you handle any

262
00:13:24,756 --> 00:13:26,156
Doing this will cause

263
00:13:26,156 --> 00:13:27,496
to appear in the input field.

264
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:33,026
Of course, as mentioned

265
00:13:33,026 --> 00:13:34,796
you can also send some

266
00:13:34,996 --> 00:13:39,056
We support sending

267
00:13:39,626 --> 00:13:45,226
and of course stickers.

268
00:13:46,066 --> 00:13:48,876
Once you've got your

269
00:13:48,876 --> 00:13:50,706
the user is able

270
00:13:50,736 --> 00:13:53,176
by tapping the blue Send

271
00:13:53,176 --> 00:13:54,656
that there's no way

272
00:13:54,656 --> 00:13:56,756
to actually automatically

273
00:13:56,756 --> 00:13:59,186
and we always want the

274
00:13:59,716 --> 00:14:01,516
as to what gets sent

275
00:13:59,716 --> 00:14:01,516
as to what gets sent

276
00:14:02,126 --> 00:14:05,926
So, now I'd like to hand

277
00:14:05,926 --> 00:14:07,996
who is going to show you

278
00:14:08,156 --> 00:14:09,396
in our sample project.

279
00:14:12,516 --> 00:14:17,056
[ Applause ]

280
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:18,446
&gt;&gt; Thanks again, Alex.

281
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:21,846
OK. I've taken the

282
00:14:21,896 --> 00:14:24,046
that I showed earlier in

283
00:14:24,046 --> 00:14:26,616
down to a very basic minimum

284
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:29,146
Here we still have our

285
00:14:29,146 --> 00:14:31,026
that have already been

286
00:14:31,026 --> 00:14:33,426
that if I tap the Add

287
00:14:34,156 --> 00:14:38,796
Here in Xcode, I have my

288
00:14:38,796 --> 00:14:39,976
subclass shown.

289
00:14:40,566 --> 00:14:42,806
I override the lifecycle

290
00:14:42,806 --> 00:14:44,656
with conversation, call super,

291
00:14:45,086 --> 00:14:46,916
and then call present

292
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:48,316
which is a helper

293
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:51,856
which will instantiate an

294
00:14:52,886 --> 00:14:54,286
and add it as a child

295
00:14:55,466 --> 00:14:56,536
And that's all I have so far.

296
00:14:58,366 --> 00:14:59,846
Now, what I'd like to do is

297
00:14:59,846 --> 00:15:02,656
when I tap this Add

298
00:14:59,846 --> 00:15:02,656
when I tap this Add

299
00:15:02,656 --> 00:15:03,856
sticker-building process.

300
00:15:05,006 --> 00:15:07,706
Now, this ice cream history

301
00:15:07,706 --> 00:15:10,796
protocol and I have an extension

302
00:15:11,226 --> 00:15:12,416
which conforms to this delegate

303
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:14,326
by implementing the method

304
00:15:14,516 --> 00:15:15,376
AddButtonTapped.

305
00:15:17,056 --> 00:15:19,976
This is where I'm going to

306
00:15:19,976 --> 00:15:22,536
and I'm going to also start

307
00:15:22,536 --> 00:15:26,796
by adding a helper method called

308
00:15:27,246 --> 00:15:29,856
which will take an ice cream

309
00:15:29,856 --> 00:15:32,696
into an MSMessage for me to

310
00:15:34,146 --> 00:15:37,746
To do so, I'm going to create

311
00:15:38,176 --> 00:15:40,436
and set the query items

312
00:15:40,436 --> 00:15:42,826
to be a query items

313
00:15:44,236 --> 00:15:46,836
Next thing I'm going to

314
00:15:46,836 --> 00:15:50,176
of MSMessageTemplateLayout and

315
00:15:50,426 --> 00:15:52,316
to be a rendered

316
00:15:53,306 --> 00:15:55,316
I also want to set a

317
00:15:56,056 --> 00:16:01,996
and I'll declare

318
00:15:56,056 --> 00:16:01,996
and I'll declare

319
00:16:02,456 --> 00:16:04,606
Now I'm ready to create

320
00:16:05,646 --> 00:16:09,776
I'll do so by declaring

321
00:16:10,206 --> 00:16:11,466
and set the URL property

322
00:16:11,466 --> 00:16:13,696
to be the URL representation

323
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:16,546
Then I'll set the layout

324
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:18,546
For brevity in the

325
00:16:18,546 --> 00:16:21,816
to reuse my message caption

326
00:16:22,446 --> 00:16:24,806
Now that I have my message,

327
00:16:24,806 --> 00:16:26,216
I'm ready to stage it

328
00:16:27,176 --> 00:16:29,086
I'll get a reference to

329
00:16:30,576 --> 00:16:32,846
and call conversation.insert

330
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:36,796
to insert the message

331
00:16:38,296 --> 00:16:40,086
Now that I've written my

332
00:16:41,056 --> 00:16:42,056
here I'm ready to call it

333
00:16:42,056 --> 00:16:44,266
from my historyViewController

334
00:16:44,786 --> 00:16:49,496
And I'll start off

335
00:16:50,026 --> 00:16:52,296
or passing a new ice

336
00:16:52,906 --> 00:16:56,516
Now when I run this

337
00:16:57,896 --> 00:16:59,486
and launch my iMessage

338
00:17:00,236 --> 00:17:05,415
wait for that debugger to attach

339
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:07,876
My message is staged

340
00:17:08,776 --> 00:17:10,886
Now, because I haven't actually

341
00:17:10,886 --> 00:17:13,516
I just have a placeholder

342
00:17:13,996 --> 00:17:15,685
and you see my caption

343
00:17:17,096 --> 00:17:19,866
Now, this is a great start,

344
00:17:19,866 --> 00:17:21,756
to that final demo that

345
00:17:22,866 --> 00:17:24,836
When I tap that Plus

346
00:17:24,836 --> 00:17:26,766
into my sticker-building

347
00:17:27,656 --> 00:17:30,546
To do so, I need to introduce

348
00:17:31,766 --> 00:17:33,356
Here my iMessage

349
00:17:33,356 --> 00:17:35,006
in a compact presentation style.

350
00:17:36,176 --> 00:17:38,186
I can choose to have my

351
00:17:38,186 --> 00:17:40,716
in an expanded presentation

352
00:17:42,746 --> 00:17:44,086
Instead of calling

353
00:17:44,086 --> 00:17:47,386
for iceCream here, I'll call

354
00:17:48,036 --> 00:17:51,006
request presentation style

355
00:17:52,386 --> 00:17:55,686
This will trigger a lifecycle

356
00:17:55,686 --> 00:17:58,256
willTransition to

357
00:17:59,816 --> 00:18:01,676
I'll call the super

358
00:17:59,816 --> 00:18:01,676
I'll call the super

359
00:18:05,376 --> 00:18:06,906
and then I'll call

360
00:18:07,196 --> 00:18:09,126
to present the right

361
00:18:09,186 --> 00:18:10,256
for this presentation style.

362
00:18:12,456 --> 00:18:12,596
Now,

363
00:18:12,596 --> 00:18:15,366
my presentChildViewController

364
00:18:15,366 --> 00:18:17,436
cream history view

365
00:18:17,436 --> 00:18:19,916
to change the logic to take into

366
00:18:20,306 --> 00:18:21,906
so I present the

367
00:18:23,116 --> 00:18:25,346
First, I'm going to add a

368
00:18:25,346 --> 00:18:26,906
which presentation

369
00:18:28,246 --> 00:18:30,086
Then I'm going to change this

370
00:18:30,856 --> 00:18:33,626
to only present my history

371
00:18:33,626 --> 00:18:35,046
in the compact presentation

372
00:18:36,566 --> 00:18:39,546
If I'm in the expanded

373
00:18:39,546 --> 00:18:41,926
to declare a new instance

374
00:18:42,826 --> 00:18:45,416
and let my controller

375
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:48,456
of an ice cream builder

376
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:50,526
to which I'll pass

377
00:18:52,406 --> 00:18:55,776
Now, lastly, before I add this

378
00:18:56,236 --> 00:18:59,666
I need to remove any previous

379
00:19:00,146 --> 00:19:01,156
to clean up my view hierarchy.

380
00:19:01,156 --> 00:19:08,246
Now I need to update the call

381
00:19:08,766 --> 00:19:11,826
Here I'm going to add that--

382
00:19:11,926 --> 00:19:16,316
pass that pending presentation

383
00:19:16,316 --> 00:19:17,396
with conversation method,

384
00:19:17,956 --> 00:19:20,396
I'm going to pass the

385
00:19:20,776 --> 00:19:24,026
which I can get as a property

386
00:19:28,676 --> 00:19:29,216
Should be right.

387
00:19:31,096 --> 00:19:34,416
Lastly-- actually, let's see--

388
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:37,306
let's see what this looks like

389
00:19:46,646 --> 00:19:47,846
And I tap that Plus (+) button.

390
00:19:48,826 --> 00:19:51,136
My iMessage application

391
00:19:51,446 --> 00:19:54,106
and I'm presenting that ice

392
00:19:55,216 --> 00:19:57,126
However, you'll notice that

393
00:19:57,126 --> 00:19:57,606
happens yet.

394
00:19:58,286 --> 00:20:00,586
Now, this is because my ice

395
00:19:58,286 --> 00:20:00,586
Now, this is because my ice

396
00:20:00,706 --> 00:20:03,686
also has a delegate protocol

397
00:20:04,306 --> 00:20:07,896
on my view controller here--

398
00:20:08,676 --> 00:20:12,146
so fast-- that implements

399
00:20:12,436 --> 00:20:14,636
by implementing the method

400
00:20:14,716 --> 00:20:16,276
didSelect iceCreamPart

401
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:20,016
This is called whenever that

402
00:20:21,476 --> 00:20:23,156
So, this is the right

403
00:20:23,156 --> 00:20:26,406
that helper method I wrote,

404
00:20:26,406 --> 00:20:28,466
in the updated ice cream

405
00:20:29,796 --> 00:20:32,226
The other thing I'm going

406
00:20:32,986 --> 00:20:37,356
because my iMessage app is done

407
00:20:37,356 --> 00:20:38,726
like my iMessage app to dismiss

408
00:20:38,726 --> 00:20:40,546
and display the staged

409
00:20:51,046 --> 00:20:54,466
Now when we launch this,

410
00:20:55,216 --> 00:20:56,476
and select an ice cream cone.

411
00:20:57,666 --> 00:20:59,816
I dismiss my iMessage app

412
00:20:59,816 --> 00:21:02,326
and the correct interactive

413
00:20:59,816 --> 00:21:02,326
and the correct interactive

414
00:21:02,326 --> 00:21:03,086
for the user to send.

415
00:21:03,086 --> 00:21:05,106
And that's a quick

416
00:21:05,106 --> 00:21:06,976
like to send an interactive

417
00:21:07,446 --> 00:21:07,976
Now back to Alex.

418
00:21:08,516 --> 00:21:15,266
[ Applause ]

419
00:21:15,766 --> 00:21:16,476
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Stephen.

420
00:21:16,556 --> 00:21:17,026
Great demo.

421
00:21:19,686 --> 00:21:25,056
So, Stephen has introduced

422
00:21:25,056 --> 00:21:28,416
to use our APIs to

423
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:30,026
into the conversation

424
00:21:30,986 --> 00:21:33,286
Stephen also introduced

425
00:21:33,916 --> 00:21:35,036
so we're going to

426
00:21:35,036 --> 00:21:36,296
at that in some more detail.

427
00:21:37,656 --> 00:21:41,076
We have two presentation

428
00:21:42,376 --> 00:21:46,076
Compact one is shown here

429
00:21:48,766 --> 00:21:50,206
So, there's a couple

430
00:21:50,206 --> 00:21:52,056
between these two

431
00:21:52,986 --> 00:21:55,386
In compact mode, you don't

432
00:21:56,496 --> 00:22:00,296
You also don't have access

433
00:21:56,496 --> 00:22:00,296
You also don't have access

434
00:22:00,426 --> 00:22:02,096
swipe gesture recognizes.

435
00:22:02,726 --> 00:22:05,986
This is because in the compact

436
00:22:05,986 --> 00:22:10,896
and right to switch between

437
00:22:11,566 --> 00:22:14,506
However, you do have

438
00:22:14,506 --> 00:22:16,316
so whenever insert

439
00:22:16,366 --> 00:22:18,386
in compact presentation style,

440
00:22:19,056 --> 00:22:20,466
the message will

441
00:22:20,466 --> 00:22:21,816
into the input fields right away

442
00:22:21,816 --> 00:22:24,046
and the user can

443
00:22:24,896 --> 00:22:28,356
Subsequent calls to insert

444
00:22:28,356 --> 00:22:30,096
message to be replaced

445
00:22:30,246 --> 00:22:32,096
so what you can do

446
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:36,106
to iteratively build a

447
00:22:36,106 --> 00:22:37,746
on the input field,

448
00:22:37,746 --> 00:22:39,906
with it they can send it.

449
00:22:41,616 --> 00:22:45,186
To contrast, in expanded

450
00:22:45,186 --> 00:22:46,836
don't have access to

451
00:22:47,406 --> 00:22:49,056
but we do have access

452
00:22:49,056 --> 00:22:51,556
to horizontal swipe gesture

453
00:22:52,286 --> 00:22:53,696
and you can use the keyboard.

454
00:22:56,796 --> 00:23:01,566
The user can always

455
00:22:56,796 --> 00:23:01,566
The user can always

456
00:23:01,686 --> 00:23:04,566
between these two styles by

457
00:23:04,566 --> 00:23:08,336
from expanded to collapse to

458
00:23:08,766 --> 00:23:11,956
and when in compact they can

459
00:23:11,956 --> 00:23:13,576
of the screen to expand your app

460
00:23:13,576 --> 00:23:15,256
into expanded presentation

461
00:23:15,856 --> 00:23:17,796
So, when you're using

462
00:23:17,796 --> 00:23:21,956
you need to be very

463
00:23:21,956 --> 00:23:23,586
in which your app is displayed.

464
00:23:23,586 --> 00:23:28,916
Whenever these transitions

465
00:23:28,916 --> 00:23:31,226
to get some callbacks

466
00:23:31,936 --> 00:23:35,016
The willTransition to

467
00:23:35,016 --> 00:23:38,456
as the transition

468
00:23:38,946 --> 00:23:42,076
when the transition is complete

469
00:23:42,076 --> 00:23:43,056
presentationStyle).

470
00:23:44,526 --> 00:23:47,936
As Stephen showed, you can

471
00:23:47,936 --> 00:23:52,856
expanded or compact by calling

472
00:23:52,856 --> 00:23:54,606
method on your principal class.

473
00:23:55,056 --> 00:23:57,886
And again, as was shown in

474
00:23:57,886 --> 00:23:59,506
and this will dismiss

475
00:23:59,836 --> 00:24:00,766
and show the keyboard.

476
00:23:59,836 --> 00:24:00,766
and show the keyboard.

477
00:24:02,796 --> 00:24:06,176
So, let's move on and talk

478
00:24:06,846 --> 00:24:10,056
We have two cases here to cover.

479
00:24:11,396 --> 00:24:13,996
One case when your extension is

480
00:24:13,996 --> 00:24:16,476
in the transcript that the

481
00:24:16,476 --> 00:24:17,496
to look at that first.

482
00:24:18,636 --> 00:24:19,986
We'll come back to

483
00:24:22,796 --> 00:24:24,246
So, looking at our

484
00:24:24,806 --> 00:24:26,896
this should be very familiar.

485
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:29,526
The bubble is tapped by the user

486
00:24:30,756 --> 00:24:32,106
and your process

487
00:24:32,186 --> 00:24:36,676
And now we go through exactly

488
00:24:36,676 --> 00:24:38,576
when your app is launched

489
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:42,786
You'll get a didBecomeActive

490
00:24:42,786 --> 00:24:45,186
by the viewWillAppear

491
00:24:46,076 --> 00:24:47,726
When this is done, you'll--

492
00:24:47,726 --> 00:24:50,666
your app will be presented in

493
00:24:51,936 --> 00:24:56,476
We always present apps in

494
00:24:56,476 --> 00:24:58,846
when the user taps a button

495
00:24:58,846 --> 00:25:01,466
taps a bubble in the

496
00:24:58,846 --> 00:25:01,466
taps a bubble in the

497
00:25:02,106 --> 00:25:07,696
Now, looking at our second case,

498
00:25:07,696 --> 00:25:11,456
In this case it's showing UI in

499
00:25:13,056 --> 00:25:16,286
So, looking again at our

500
00:25:16,286 --> 00:25:18,836
the bubble is tapped

501
00:25:19,496 --> 00:25:21,986
So, we're not going to

502
00:25:21,986 --> 00:25:22,866
or didBecomeActive.

503
00:25:23,726 --> 00:25:26,326
Instead, you'll receive

504
00:25:26,326 --> 00:25:28,236
to presentationStyle expanded.

505
00:25:29,356 --> 00:25:32,596
This is followed by a didSelect

506
00:25:33,906 --> 00:25:36,286
This is called on your principal

507
00:25:36,286 --> 00:25:38,346
that the user tapped on a

508
00:25:38,346 --> 00:25:39,876
and selected a message.

509
00:25:41,106 --> 00:25:42,536
Then finally as the transition

510
00:25:42,536 --> 00:25:45,186
to expanded presentation

511
00:25:45,186 --> 00:25:47,146
didTransition to

512
00:25:47,146 --> 00:25:52,466
So, now at the end of

513
00:25:53,096 --> 00:25:56,606
your app is presenting the UI in

514
00:25:56,856 --> 00:25:59,686
and you'll want to get that

515
00:26:00,196 --> 00:26:03,976
so this is done using the

516
00:26:03,976 --> 00:26:05,676
property and you can get this

517
00:26:05,676 --> 00:26:07,306
from the current

518
00:26:07,306 --> 00:26:09,966
on your principal class.

519
00:26:10,606 --> 00:26:13,706
You're going to want to show

520
00:26:13,736 --> 00:26:16,216
and allow the user to

521
00:26:18,386 --> 00:26:20,126
Now I'd like you to hand

522
00:26:20,126 --> 00:26:21,486
for one final demo

523
00:26:21,486 --> 00:26:23,986
to implement reply

524
00:26:25,516 --> 00:26:30,696
[ Applause ]

525
00:26:31,196 --> 00:26:32,376
&gt;&gt; OK, so we left off

526
00:26:32,626 --> 00:26:34,336
with a staged message

527
00:26:34,756 --> 00:26:35,786
which I'll go ahead and send.

528
00:26:36,126 --> 00:26:40,326
And now if I go back to the

529
00:26:40,326 --> 00:26:42,776
to the other end of

530
00:26:42,776 --> 00:26:43,676
that received message.

531
00:26:44,916 --> 00:26:46,026
When I tap that message,

532
00:26:46,376 --> 00:26:49,086
my iMessage app is

533
00:26:49,266 --> 00:26:51,916
my ice cream building experience

534
00:26:51,916 --> 00:26:52,956
in the ice cream

535
00:26:52,956 --> 00:26:56,156
I'm not ready to select ice

536
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:57,046
because every time

537
00:26:57,046 --> 00:26:59,016
that I currently present

538
00:26:59,276 --> 00:27:01,226
I'm always passing in a

539
00:26:59,276 --> 00:27:01,226
I'm always passing in a

540
00:27:02,206 --> 00:27:04,216
What I need to do is look

541
00:27:04,216 --> 00:27:06,766
on the conversation and use

542
00:27:06,766 --> 00:27:08,466
from that selected

543
00:27:10,136 --> 00:27:14,476
So, I'll go back up here

544
00:27:14,476 --> 00:27:18,306
that ice cream builder

545
00:27:18,306 --> 00:27:24,196
to my active conversation

546
00:27:24,196 --> 00:27:28,796
initializer here that looks at

547
00:27:29,966 --> 00:27:31,856
and if that initializer

548
00:27:31,856 --> 00:27:34,316
that I don't have anything in

549
00:27:34,316 --> 00:27:37,546
that new ice cream model, but

550
00:27:37,546 --> 00:27:38,726
in the in progress ice cream.

551
00:27:40,406 --> 00:27:42,546
The other thing I want

552
00:27:42,546 --> 00:27:45,096
that I am passing the

553
00:27:45,166 --> 00:27:47,886
on the ice cream part

554
00:27:50,026 --> 00:27:54,246
To do so, I'm going to need

555
00:27:54,246 --> 00:27:56,606
into this method, which is

556
00:27:57,726 --> 00:28:02,486
Now, this message caption here

557
00:27:57,726 --> 00:28:02,486
Now, this message caption here

558
00:28:03,266 --> 00:28:07,216
of the string type and

559
00:28:08,616 --> 00:28:09,896
on the selectedIceCreamPart

560
00:28:10,196 --> 00:28:11,606
to choose a correct

561
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:19,996
Oh, and I also need to update

562
00:28:19,996 --> 00:28:21,546
to pass in that new parameter.

563
00:28:22,586 --> 00:28:38,596
Now when I launch my iMessage

564
00:28:39,306 --> 00:28:43,926
send that first message and then

565
00:28:44,286 --> 00:28:45,766
and to the other end

566
00:28:47,346 --> 00:28:49,566
and now I'll tap the received

567
00:28:49,916 --> 00:28:52,376
that my ice cream builder view

568
00:28:52,376 --> 00:28:53,626
up to pick an ice cream scoop.

569
00:28:55,946 --> 00:29:00,006
Now I can select some

570
00:28:55,946 --> 00:29:00,006
Now I can select some

571
00:29:01,746 --> 00:29:02,646
go back to the other end

572
00:29:02,646 --> 00:29:06,056
of the conversation once

573
00:29:06,056 --> 00:29:11,056
So, now you can see

574
00:29:11,056 --> 00:29:13,016
like to send interactive

575
00:29:13,266 --> 00:29:14,956
and accomplish a

576
00:29:16,786 --> 00:29:18,546
However, you'll see that

577
00:29:18,546 --> 00:29:20,516
my partially built ice

578
00:29:20,516 --> 00:29:21,896
to pollute my conversation

579
00:29:23,296 --> 00:29:25,306
I don't really need to see the

580
00:29:25,306 --> 00:29:27,056
I only really care about

581
00:29:28,876 --> 00:29:31,746
What I'd like to do is

582
00:29:32,006 --> 00:29:33,716
and maybe leave behind

583
00:29:34,226 --> 00:29:34,996
of those messages.

584
00:29:35,996 --> 00:29:38,576
To do so, I'm going to make use

585
00:29:39,046 --> 00:29:40,116
to group messages together.

586
00:29:43,406 --> 00:29:44,986
Here when I'm composing

587
00:29:46,016 --> 00:29:48,166
I'm going to move my reference

588
00:29:48,166 --> 00:29:51,566
to my active conversation

589
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:57,366
when I declare my session

590
00:29:57,366 --> 00:30:01,616
if I have a session already on

591
00:29:57,366 --> 00:30:01,616
if I have a session already on

592
00:30:01,616 --> 00:30:04,086
that if it exists so that it

593
00:30:05,196 --> 00:30:07,046
Otherwise, I'll create

594
00:30:09,386 --> 00:30:10,736
I'll then pass that session here

595
00:30:12,406 --> 00:30:14,456
into my initializer

596
00:30:17,576 --> 00:30:19,806
Now, the other thing I want to

597
00:30:19,806 --> 00:30:21,306
of messages when

598
00:30:23,956 --> 00:30:25,136
Here I'm going to

599
00:30:25,366 --> 00:30:27,826
or declare a variable

600
00:30:29,896 --> 00:30:35,126
and here I'll choose the right

601
00:30:35,126 --> 00:30:36,176
ice cream part that was chosen.

602
00:30:39,756 --> 00:30:42,746
Now I could take that

603
00:30:42,746 --> 00:30:43,916
on my MSMessage object.

604
00:30:45,856 --> 00:30:47,756
And that's it.

605
00:30:50,256 --> 00:30:53,476
Oh, maybe I should

606
00:30:54,666 --> 00:31:01,096
There we go.

607
00:30:54,666 --> 00:31:01,096
There we go.

608
00:31:01,736 --> 00:31:06,416
Now when I launch my iMessage

609
00:31:06,416 --> 00:31:10,756
of building an ice cream--

610
00:31:12,356 --> 00:31:15,686
doesn't ice cream

611
00:31:16,586 --> 00:31:20,586
I can pick my flavor of

612
00:31:20,586 --> 00:31:24,436
that that summary text has

613
00:31:24,436 --> 00:31:26,536
for me there when

614
00:31:28,966 --> 00:31:32,446
Now if I go-- sorry-- I'm going

615
00:31:32,446 --> 00:31:35,856
of the conversation, tap

616
00:31:35,926 --> 00:31:41,456
I think chocolate sounds like

617
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:44,326
Now when I send that I have a

618
00:31:44,766 --> 00:31:47,626
but I'm only showing the one--

619
00:31:47,626 --> 00:31:51,206
the one image here and I have a

620
00:31:51,206 --> 00:31:53,556
transcript there.

621
00:31:53,796 --> 00:31:56,906
Also, when I go into

622
00:31:57,836 --> 00:32:00,776
you'll see my newly completed

623
00:31:57,836 --> 00:32:00,776
you'll see my newly completed

624
00:32:00,776 --> 00:32:01,946
to use however I'd like.

625
00:32:03,186 --> 00:32:03,716
And that's it.

626
00:32:03,716 --> 00:32:05,146
We have a completed

627
00:32:05,756 --> 00:32:07,666
Now, this was an example of how

628
00:32:07,666 --> 00:32:11,066
to build an interactive

629
00:32:11,436 --> 00:32:13,266
but you could take

630
00:32:13,266 --> 00:32:14,676
You can build-- you

631
00:32:14,676 --> 00:32:15,786
with wonderful services

632
00:32:16,146 --> 00:32:18,386
and build nice awesome

633
00:32:18,386 --> 00:32:19,386
and I can't wait to

634
00:32:20,036 --> 00:32:20,636
Now, back to Alex.

635
00:32:21,516 --> 00:32:23,926
[ Applause ]

636
00:32:24,426 --> 00:32:24,886
Thanks, Stephen.

637
00:32:24,886 --> 00:32:26,166
That was another awesome demo

638
00:32:26,456 --> 00:32:28,716
and Stephen implemented

639
00:32:28,806 --> 00:32:32,486
and also introduced

640
00:32:33,066 --> 00:32:34,996
So, let's dive into

641
00:32:35,526 --> 00:32:42,146
What we saw in the demo was a

642
00:32:42,146 --> 00:32:45,626
of half-completed ice creams

643
00:32:46,026 --> 00:32:48,486
to take that and turn it into

644
00:32:48,486 --> 00:32:51,806
like this, which is a lot

645
00:32:52,536 --> 00:32:52,916
It's great.

646
00:32:53,666 --> 00:32:58,476
So, to implement this, we

647
00:32:58,676 --> 00:33:03,026
We created an MSSession and

648
00:32:58,676 --> 00:33:03,026
We created an MSSession and

649
00:33:03,026 --> 00:33:05,496
that was part of the session,

650
00:33:05,836 --> 00:33:08,646
into its initializer and we

651
00:33:09,556 --> 00:33:12,486
We can set some summary text

652
00:33:13,016 --> 00:33:17,356
and then we send it using the

653
00:33:17,446 --> 00:33:18,406
as we've seen before.

654
00:33:18,406 --> 00:33:24,626
When we're replying to a

655
00:33:24,626 --> 00:33:27,406
to create a new session; we

656
00:33:27,456 --> 00:33:29,726
and we can get the

657
00:33:29,936 --> 00:33:31,786
from the current conversation

658
00:33:31,786 --> 00:33:34,036
so the activeConversation

659
00:33:34,276 --> 00:33:36,836
The selected message will

660
00:33:37,096 --> 00:33:38,356
if it's a session message.

661
00:33:40,016 --> 00:33:44,716
Then we take that session, we

662
00:33:44,716 --> 00:33:47,186
the messages initializer,

663
00:33:49,316 --> 00:33:53,036
We see here the summaryText

664
00:33:53,096 --> 00:33:55,646
for the message summary in

665
00:33:56,816 --> 00:34:00,116
You can now also omit this

666
00:33:56,816 --> 00:34:00,116
You can now also omit this

667
00:34:00,116 --> 00:34:04,826
and if you do that then there

668
00:34:04,826 --> 00:34:07,656
in the transcript, but your

669
00:34:08,146 --> 00:34:09,275
in the session behavior.

670
00:34:09,576 --> 00:34:12,116
So, now we've covered the basics

671
00:34:12,116 --> 00:34:14,295
to build a very simple

672
00:34:14,826 --> 00:34:18,545
that sends interactive

673
00:34:19,045 --> 00:34:22,106
We're going to move

674
00:34:22,106 --> 00:34:28,295
of the more advanced

675
00:34:28,876 --> 00:34:31,616
We'll start by looking at

676
00:34:31,616 --> 00:34:32,636
on your principal class.

677
00:34:34,085 --> 00:34:36,565
We'll move on and talk

678
00:34:37,666 --> 00:34:40,656
and finally we'll discuss

679
00:34:40,656 --> 00:34:41,726
of a particular message.

680
00:34:43,835 --> 00:34:48,426
First, when the user

681
00:34:48,426 --> 00:34:51,596
we realize that your app may wan

682
00:34:52,585 --> 00:34:55,266
For instance, if you're a game

683
00:34:55,976 --> 00:34:58,726
we need to know when to update

684
00:34:58,726 --> 00:34:59,896
and that should really

685
00:34:59,896 --> 00:35:01,736
when the message

686
00:34:59,896 --> 00:35:01,736
when the message

687
00:35:03,896 --> 00:35:06,246
So, we have a

688
00:35:06,686 --> 00:35:12,366
on the principal class

689
00:35:12,366 --> 00:35:13,946
when the user taps

690
00:35:14,516 --> 00:35:15,446
Now, this is important.

691
00:35:15,706 --> 00:35:16,996
That message-- that

692
00:35:16,996 --> 00:35:20,096
that the message has actually

693
00:35:20,386 --> 00:35:23,226
All it means is the user

694
00:35:23,226 --> 00:35:28,336
and it communicates the

695
00:35:29,056 --> 00:35:31,916
We also have, similarly,

696
00:35:32,906 --> 00:35:34,936
This happens when the

697
00:35:35,336 --> 00:35:38,626
in the top right hand corner of

698
00:35:39,526 --> 00:35:41,646
didCancelSending is your

699
00:35:41,646 --> 00:35:44,046
up any resources that have

700
00:35:44,046 --> 00:35:45,306
composition of that message.

701
00:35:45,956 --> 00:35:49,866
And lastly we have

702
00:35:51,256 --> 00:35:56,416
didRecieveMessage happens-- is

703
00:35:56,896 --> 00:36:01,556
or active and a message has come

704
00:35:56,896 --> 00:36:01,556
or active and a message has come

705
00:36:01,556 --> 00:36:03,316
one of the participants

706
00:36:03,316 --> 00:36:08,246
And it's a-- this is useful,

707
00:36:08,336 --> 00:36:11,006
if your user is editing

708
00:36:11,006 --> 00:36:13,146
and another message comes

709
00:36:13,456 --> 00:36:17,006
it's an updated state and

710
00:36:17,006 --> 00:36:18,316
that represents this state.

711
00:36:19,316 --> 00:36:22,176
So, let's move on and talk

712
00:36:22,676 --> 00:36:25,296
iMessage apps are going to be

713
00:36:25,606 --> 00:36:26,776
so you're going to

714
00:36:26,776 --> 00:36:29,266
that when you're building them.

715
00:36:29,866 --> 00:36:32,516
We have here an example

716
00:36:32,516 --> 00:36:35,466
between three friends:

717
00:36:36,766 --> 00:36:41,336
Ben's getting ice cream

718
00:36:41,336 --> 00:36:43,396
out a question to

719
00:36:43,766 --> 00:36:45,766
Which topping do you-- would

720
00:36:46,016 --> 00:36:47,776
Chocolate sauce or sprinkles?

721
00:36:48,286 --> 00:36:53,756
Amber is going to reply

722
00:36:54,726 --> 00:36:57,446
and Chris here is going

723
00:36:59,056 --> 00:37:01,966
Both users send these messages

724
00:36:59,056 --> 00:37:01,966
Both users send these messages

725
00:37:02,526 --> 00:37:09,206
Let's focus a little bit now

726
00:37:09,206 --> 00:37:10,966
on his device as

727
00:37:11,486 --> 00:37:17,306
First, Amber's reply is going

728
00:37:17,486 --> 00:37:19,226
and this is followed

729
00:37:19,456 --> 00:37:20,516
by the reply from Chris.

730
00:37:20,516 --> 00:37:26,526
So, you note Amber's reply was

731
00:37:26,846 --> 00:37:28,356
and Chris's reply is shown

732
00:37:28,356 --> 00:37:30,056
as the last bubble

733
00:37:30,606 --> 00:37:34,956
This could just as easily have

734
00:37:37,156 --> 00:37:40,836
and we should note that only

735
00:37:40,836 --> 00:37:45,286
to your iMessage app, so

736
00:37:45,286 --> 00:37:47,456
to Amber's reply in our example.

737
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:49,776
How do we deal with this?

738
00:37:49,866 --> 00:37:51,896
Well, right now we're

739
00:37:51,896 --> 00:37:54,586
that you store state in

740
00:37:54,586 --> 00:37:57,166
that the URL property of the

741
00:37:57,166 --> 00:38:02,076
and from the participants in

742
00:37:57,166 --> 00:38:02,076
and from the participants in

743
00:38:02,076 --> 00:38:05,846
only needs to take a token

744
00:38:07,806 --> 00:38:10,166
and then you receive the

745
00:38:10,796 --> 00:38:13,066
when the user taps on a message.

746
00:38:13,376 --> 00:38:15,076
And when a user sends a message,

747
00:38:15,076 --> 00:38:16,486
you should push the

748
00:38:16,486 --> 00:38:20,046
of the session up to the cloud.

749
00:38:20,736 --> 00:38:22,906
Moving on, we're going to

750
00:38:23,516 --> 00:38:29,126
Here we have a conversation

751
00:38:29,516 --> 00:38:31,116
between Amber, Ben,

752
00:38:31,706 --> 00:38:35,706
In this scenario,

753
00:38:36,876 --> 00:38:38,386
with a preference

754
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:40,066
Chris has not yet replied.

755
00:38:42,456 --> 00:38:46,816
Focusing again on Ben's

756
00:38:46,816 --> 00:38:52,396
and we don't know who to

757
00:38:52,506 --> 00:38:55,316
out some information about that.

758
00:38:55,316 --> 00:38:59,686
Now, what we have here are some

759
00:38:59,996 --> 00:39:01,846
sorry, let me rephrase that.

760
00:38:59,996 --> 00:39:01,846
sorry, let me rephrase that.

761
00:39:01,946 --> 00:39:04,816
What we have here are some

762
00:39:05,656 --> 00:39:08,456
Apple is very, very

763
00:39:08,516 --> 00:39:12,156
and we really very highly value

764
00:39:12,476 --> 00:39:14,576
so we don't expose

765
00:39:14,576 --> 00:39:17,806
at all to iMessage apps.

766
00:39:18,346 --> 00:39:20,926
Instead, we provide these

767
00:39:22,486 --> 00:39:25,626
On Ben's device, he has a

768
00:39:25,756 --> 00:39:29,846
and this is a UUID that

769
00:39:31,056 --> 00:39:34,766
He also has two remote

770
00:39:35,766 --> 00:39:39,336
These represent the

771
00:39:39,336 --> 00:39:40,226
in the conversation.

772
00:39:40,316 --> 00:39:41,406
In this case, we have two.

773
00:39:41,406 --> 00:39:42,956
We have Amber and we have Chris.

774
00:39:43,006 --> 00:39:46,606
Looking at the incoming message,

775
00:39:46,646 --> 00:39:48,946
we see that the message

776
00:39:49,516 --> 00:39:51,176
and this will map to one

777
00:39:51,176 --> 00:39:54,466
of the local participant

778
00:39:56,036 --> 00:39:59,526
Moving back to the big

779
00:39:59,526 --> 00:40:06,276
and Chris's device, the sending

780
00:39:59,526 --> 00:40:06,276
and Chris's device, the sending

781
00:40:06,346 --> 00:40:12,716
and these map to the local

782
00:40:12,716 --> 00:40:14,266
that sent that message.

783
00:40:14,836 --> 00:40:22,246
You can use these identifiers

784
00:40:22,246 --> 00:40:23,856
of participants in

785
00:40:25,066 --> 00:40:26,886
You can attribute

786
00:40:26,886 --> 00:40:28,566
so once you've received

787
00:40:28,656 --> 00:40:30,306
with a particular

788
00:40:30,306 --> 00:40:32,716
and you receive a second

789
00:40:32,986 --> 00:40:34,526
you know they've come

790
00:40:35,986 --> 00:40:40,586
They can also be used in

791
00:40:41,156 --> 00:40:44,266
They can be used to

792
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:46,356
And one more thing.

793
00:40:48,466 --> 00:40:51,116
You can use these identifiers

794
00:40:51,116 --> 00:40:55,336
of these identifiers prefixed

795
00:40:55,336 --> 00:40:56,636
of the text passed

796
00:40:56,636 --> 00:40:58,956
to the MessageTemplateLayout's

797
00:40:59,476 --> 00:41:02,806
You can also use-- similarly,

798
00:40:59,476 --> 00:41:02,806
You can also use-- similarly,

799
00:41:02,806 --> 00:41:06,296
in the text passed to the

800
00:41:07,656 --> 00:41:10,936
When Messages displays the UI

801
00:41:10,936 --> 00:41:14,766
of formatting in their text,

802
00:41:14,766 --> 00:41:17,396
with the contact

803
00:41:17,396 --> 00:41:23,456
that their identifier maps to.

804
00:41:26,156 --> 00:41:30,916
These identifiers are

805
00:41:31,256 --> 00:41:33,326
If you noticed on the

806
00:41:33,326 --> 00:41:35,376
for every person the

807
00:41:37,356 --> 00:41:40,716
And they're scoped to the

808
00:41:40,716 --> 00:41:42,766
and what I mean by this is

809
00:41:42,766 --> 00:41:45,936
that the identifiers themselves

810
00:41:47,486 --> 00:41:50,356
but if the user removes

811
00:41:50,356 --> 00:41:52,176
and then later reinstalls it,

812
00:41:52,906 --> 00:41:56,016
you'll get a completely

813
00:41:56,016 --> 00:41:57,776
within the same conversation.

814
00:41:58,366 --> 00:42:02,806
You can get the sender

815
00:41:58,366 --> 00:42:02,806
You can get the sender

816
00:42:02,806 --> 00:42:06,176
from an MSMessage using the

817
00:42:06,176 --> 00:42:10,736
property and you can get the

818
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:14,236
conversation using the

819
00:42:14,236 --> 00:42:14,696
property.

820
00:42:16,326 --> 00:42:19,746
And you can get the list of

821
00:42:19,746 --> 00:42:21,976
from the

822
00:42:28,236 --> 00:42:28,456
property.

823
00:42:30,046 --> 00:42:33,946
So, that wraps our more

824
00:42:33,946 --> 00:42:37,886
We're going to talk a little bit

825
00:42:39,366 --> 00:42:44,006
Interactive messages will be

826
00:42:44,006 --> 00:42:47,136
watchOS 3, macOS

827
00:42:47,956 --> 00:42:51,626
Of these platforms, only iOS 10

828
00:42:53,026 --> 00:42:55,916
On macOS Sierra, the user

829
00:42:55,916 --> 00:43:00,106
in the conversation

830
00:42:55,916 --> 00:43:00,106
in the conversation

831
00:43:00,106 --> 00:43:04,456
to the Messages URL property

832
00:43:04,456 --> 00:43:08,656
That will only be if it's

833
00:43:09,706 --> 00:43:13,426
On watch, you can hand off

834
00:43:13,426 --> 00:43:23,616
where you're able

835
00:43:24,726 --> 00:43:28,316
We also support some

836
00:43:28,806 --> 00:43:32,566
These messages will be

837
00:43:32,566 --> 00:43:36,426
iOS 9, and OS 10.11,

838
00:43:36,426 --> 00:43:37,456
in a fallback format.

839
00:43:37,596 --> 00:43:39,086
There's two separate messages.

840
00:43:39,996 --> 00:43:42,316
The first one will be

841
00:43:42,316 --> 00:43:43,376
in the template layout.

842
00:43:44,326 --> 00:43:48,996
The second one will be a URL

843
00:43:49,836 --> 00:43:53,216
Now, again note if this is

844
00:43:53,606 --> 00:43:55,186
If it's a data URL, we won't.

845
00:43:56,036 --> 00:44:00,076
So, we only-- we'll only

846
00:43:56,036 --> 00:44:00,076
So, we only-- we'll only

847
00:44:00,076 --> 00:44:01,286
in the fallback message.

848
00:44:01,866 --> 00:44:05,776
So, that wraps up our talk.

849
00:44:06,596 --> 00:44:08,946
In summary, we have-- this week,

850
00:44:09,006 --> 00:44:12,556
we've introduced the Messages

851
00:44:13,166 --> 00:44:17,976
In the first part of this talk,

852
00:44:18,256 --> 00:44:20,306
to sticker packs

853
00:44:20,306 --> 00:44:23,416
to create simple iMessage apps

854
00:44:24,906 --> 00:44:26,966
Today, we've created

855
00:44:26,966 --> 00:44:30,636
that send interactive

856
00:44:30,636 --> 00:44:32,516
about how they work

857
00:44:32,516 --> 00:44:35,586
and a few other things.

858
00:44:35,996 --> 00:44:38,476
Now I'm really excited to

859
00:44:38,476 --> 00:44:39,876
and make with this API.

860
00:44:39,876 --> 00:44:45,426
I can't wait to see what you

864
00:44:59,386 --> 00:45:00,606
We have a related session.

865
00:44:59,386 --> 00:45:00,606
We have a related session.

866
00:45:00,606 --> 00:45:03,786
If you haven't already seen

867
00:45:03,786 --> 00:45:06,176
Part 1", then please go

868
00:45:07,446 --> 00:45:09,456
And that wraps up our talk.

869
00:45:09,456 --> 00:45:11,496
Thanks to Stephen

870
00:45:11,796 --> 00:45:12,916
Thanks to you guys for coming.
