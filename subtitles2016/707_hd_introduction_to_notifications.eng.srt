&gt;&gt; Good morning everybody

4
00:00:29,076 --> 00:00:30,386
Introduction to Notifications.

5
00:00:30,956 --> 00:00:33,976
I'm Kritarth Jain an engineer

6
00:00:33,976 --> 00:00:36,176
and today I'll be joined

7
00:00:36,246 --> 00:00:37,596
for the later half

8
00:00:38,366 --> 00:00:40,206
Now the team's been

9
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:43,206
over the last one year to

10
00:00:43,206 --> 00:00:46,336
for notifications for iOS

11
00:00:46,496 --> 00:00:47,366
to share it with you today.

12
00:00:47,996 --> 00:00:49,826
We're going to start

13
00:00:49,826 --> 00:00:52,576
out by doing an overview

14
00:00:53,526 --> 00:00:56,146
And today we're existing

15
00:00:56,216 --> 00:00:57,806
for doing user notifications.

16
00:00:58,666 --> 00:01:01,386
As part of this, we're

17
00:00:58,666 --> 00:01:01,386
As part of this, we're

18
00:01:02,056 --> 00:01:04,916
content creation, scheduling

19
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:08,816
managing them, and action

20
00:01:10,146 --> 00:01:11,436
And lastly, we're going

21
00:01:11,436 --> 00:01:14,936
to introduce a brand new feature

22
00:01:15,426 --> 00:01:18,106
that we think you're

23
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:21,736
But there's a lot more to cover

24
00:01:22,036 --> 00:01:24,116
and we're not going to get

25
00:01:24,686 --> 00:01:26,756
So there's going to be an

26
00:01:26,756 --> 00:01:29,076
following this one

27
00:01:29,536 --> 00:01:30,656
So do make sure to check it out.

28
00:01:32,106 --> 00:01:34,796
So let's begin by talking

29
00:01:35,796 --> 00:01:37,146
Now I'm sure all

30
00:01:37,146 --> 00:01:38,826
with what a notification

31
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:42,566
This is how your

32
00:01:42,566 --> 00:01:45,306
to your app users when your

33
00:01:46,476 --> 00:01:48,596
It's a push mechanism

34
00:01:48,906 --> 00:01:52,916
versus a pull mechanism where

35
00:01:52,916 --> 00:01:55,696
to the application to get the

36
00:01:57,296 --> 00:01:59,916
Now, you as app developers,

37
00:01:59,916 --> 00:02:02,096
in which you can send these

38
00:01:59,916 --> 00:02:02,096
in which you can send these

39
00:02:03,396 --> 00:02:06,376
They can be visual alerts,

40
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:07,426
down from the top as a banner.

41
00:02:08,356 --> 00:02:10,536
You can do sound and

42
00:02:10,536 --> 00:02:13,606
with your notifications as

43
00:02:13,936 --> 00:02:14,976
So that the user knows

44
00:02:14,976 --> 00:02:18,906
which application has

45
00:02:19,076 --> 00:02:20,826
Depending upon the

46
00:02:21,076 --> 00:02:23,266
there're different ways how

47
00:02:23,936 --> 00:02:26,696
If the device is unlocked

48
00:02:26,696 --> 00:02:27,896
down from the top as a banner.

49
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:31,706
While the device is locked,

50
00:02:31,706 --> 00:02:32,816
on the user's lock screen.

51
00:02:32,816 --> 00:02:36,096
And if the user ever

52
00:02:36,286 --> 00:02:38,216
they can always go to

53
00:02:38,216 --> 00:02:40,716
and see all the pending

54
00:02:40,716 --> 00:02:42,356
for them there.

55
00:02:42,566 --> 00:02:45,356
So what are the different

56
00:02:45,356 --> 00:02:48,466
as app developers can use for

57
00:02:49,136 --> 00:02:50,376
Mainly there are two types.

58
00:02:50,736 --> 00:02:53,036
Local notifications and

59
00:02:53,356 --> 00:02:55,006
depending on their

60
00:02:55,566 --> 00:02:57,336
So let's look at

61
00:02:58,266 --> 00:03:01,226
Now local notifications

62
00:02:58,266 --> 00:03:01,226
Now local notifications

63
00:03:01,226 --> 00:03:03,136
by applications that

64
00:03:04,356 --> 00:03:07,206
Examples of local notifications

65
00:03:07,206 --> 00:03:08,386
or location based triggers,

66
00:03:08,776 --> 00:03:11,006
where your application

67
00:03:11,146 --> 00:03:13,276
with the system showing

68
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:16,096
to the user's device, and

69
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:18,656
notification, your

70
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:21,416
As I mentioned, examples

71
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:23,576
of these can include

72
00:03:23,976 --> 00:03:26,096
calendar alerts, or

73
00:03:27,456 --> 00:03:30,376
Now, not all your

74
00:03:30,576 --> 00:03:31,626
on the user's device.

75
00:03:32,196 --> 00:03:34,836
A lot of them have a

76
00:03:35,076 --> 00:03:37,086
where your server-side

77
00:03:37,516 --> 00:03:39,176
across the network

78
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:41,856
So to facilitate notifications

79
00:03:41,856 --> 00:03:44,056
for that we have

80
00:03:44,656 --> 00:03:46,496
Let's take a look at how

81
00:03:47,906 --> 00:03:51,016
The main piece involved in

82
00:03:51,016 --> 00:03:53,326
Notification Service,

83
00:03:54,456 --> 00:03:55,776
It's part of remote

84
00:03:56,556 --> 00:03:59,096
Your remote site application

85
00:03:59,256 --> 00:04:02,506
to APNs, which then does

86
00:03:59,256 --> 00:04:02,506
to APNs, which then does

87
00:04:02,656 --> 00:04:05,456
of this notification to the

88
00:04:05,456 --> 00:04:08,006
that notification and then

89
00:04:08,006 --> 00:04:11,306
to be handled when the

90
00:04:11,566 --> 00:04:14,686
Examples of remote notifications

91
00:04:14,726 --> 00:04:17,685
where your server-side

92
00:04:17,685 --> 00:04:20,866
breaking news and then

93
00:04:21,026 --> 00:04:23,456
to the different devices

94
00:04:23,656 --> 00:04:26,496
that have your application

95
00:04:27,676 --> 00:04:30,246
Instant messaging alerts as well

96
00:04:30,246 --> 00:04:33,256
on your servers, and when a new

97
00:04:33,256 --> 00:04:37,216
that notification along

98
00:04:37,366 --> 00:04:40,956
Now remote notifications in turn

99
00:04:41,276 --> 00:04:43,676
they can be either

100
00:04:44,286 --> 00:04:46,206
Now user-facing notifications,

101
00:04:46,206 --> 00:04:48,646
as the name suggests are

102
00:04:48,646 --> 00:04:49,806
to the user on the device.

103
00:04:50,446 --> 00:04:53,266
And by setting up your

104
00:04:53,266 --> 00:04:56,406
way, you can add this content

105
00:04:57,696 --> 00:04:59,536
As opposed to user-facing

106
00:04:59,926 --> 00:05:02,196
we also offer silent

107
00:04:59,926 --> 00:05:02,196
we also offer silent

108
00:05:04,216 --> 00:05:06,836
Now, these silent

109
00:05:07,196 --> 00:05:10,306
where your notification payload

110
00:05:10,306 --> 00:05:13,856
flag when this notification

111
00:05:14,116 --> 00:05:17,196
the system knows to wake your

112
00:05:17,486 --> 00:05:19,046
to perform a background

113
00:05:19,576 --> 00:05:22,956
So then your client-side

114
00:05:23,196 --> 00:05:24,946
to your remote server

115
00:05:25,236 --> 00:05:27,236
and get the latest

116
00:05:27,236 --> 00:05:29,846
so that the next time your

117
00:05:29,846 --> 00:05:33,386
to your device they see the

118
00:05:33,386 --> 00:05:36,196
to them giving them a

119
00:05:38,436 --> 00:05:41,006
So that was in a nutshell

120
00:05:41,186 --> 00:05:43,196
type of those notification

121
00:05:43,686 --> 00:05:46,356
Now before we proceed,

122
00:05:46,356 --> 00:05:47,366
of the existing API

123
00:05:47,526 --> 00:05:51,226
for notifications

124
00:05:51,386 --> 00:05:55,016
Now, you use UI application for

125
00:05:55,426 --> 00:05:56,976
and then scheduling

126
00:05:57,316 --> 00:05:58,526
that your application

127
00:05:59,196 --> 00:06:01,996
This is part of the UI kit

128
00:05:59,196 --> 00:06:01,996
This is part of the UI kit

129
00:06:01,996 --> 00:06:02,706
of you are familiar with.

130
00:06:03,706 --> 00:06:06,406
However, there were some

131
00:06:06,406 --> 00:06:09,846
For example, there are

132
00:06:09,846 --> 00:06:11,576
and remote notifications

133
00:06:11,576 --> 00:06:13,476
to the duplication of code.

134
00:06:14,716 --> 00:06:16,376
There's also limited control.

135
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:19,266
After your application has

136
00:06:19,366 --> 00:06:22,996
to the user and there's

137
00:06:23,236 --> 00:06:25,596
for notifications across

138
00:06:25,596 --> 00:06:27,986
that Apple supports today.

139
00:06:28,176 --> 00:06:31,166
So we really wanted to

140
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:34,706
and on top of that give you

141
00:06:35,066 --> 00:06:37,486
for really elevating the

142
00:06:37,526 --> 00:06:38,326
for your app users.

143
00:06:38,326 --> 00:06:42,736
So today we're really excited to

144
00:06:42,796 --> 00:06:44,346
for doing user notifications.

145
00:06:45,376 --> 00:06:47,706
Let's take a look at what's

146
00:06:48,696 --> 00:06:52,736
To start out, it has a very

with what exists today.

So transferring your code

149
00:06:56,796 --> 00:07:00,286
to the new framework

to the new framework

151
00:07:00,436 --> 00:07:03,436
We've also expanded the

152
00:07:03,436 --> 00:07:06,496
on the notifications for having

153
00:07:06,496 --> 00:07:07,496
to your user.

154
00:07:08,336 --> 00:07:10,736
We've combined the

155
00:07:10,736 --> 00:07:13,406
and remote notification handling

156
00:07:13,636 --> 00:07:14,846
for handling the notifications.

[ Applause ]

158
00:07:21,326 --> 00:07:23,286
We've also simplified

159
00:07:23,656 --> 00:07:26,186
that your application gets

160
00:07:26,186 --> 00:07:28,116
with actions on these

161
00:07:28,646 --> 00:07:32,396
We've also included better

162
00:07:32,836 --> 00:07:35,576
What this means is that

163
00:07:35,576 --> 00:07:37,806
to notifications that are

164
00:07:37,806 --> 00:07:41,266
or already delivered to the

165
00:07:41,476 --> 00:07:43,026
as well update notifications.

166
00:07:43,456 --> 00:07:45,746
We'll take a look at all of this

167
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:50,496
Starting in iOS 10 we now

168
00:07:50,616 --> 00:07:52,956
to do in-app presentation

[ Applause ]

170
00:07:57,046 --> 00:08:00,476
So now, your apps get the

So now, your apps get the

172
00:08:00,636 --> 00:08:03,196
as the system supports

173
00:08:06,076 --> 00:08:07,126
You can now also schedule

174
00:08:07,126 --> 00:08:12,306
and handle notifications

175
00:08:13,766 --> 00:08:15,746
And lastly, we've

176
00:08:15,946 --> 00:08:18,586
to notifications themselves,

177

So what this new

178
00:08:22,816 --> 00:08:26,486
to have a single notifications

179
00:08:26,486 --> 00:08:30,506
that Apple supports, including

Let's take a look at what

181
00:08:33,905 --> 00:08:35,116
for all these different

182
00:08:37,046 --> 00:08:40,316
On iOS, we give the full

183
00:08:40,316 --> 00:08:42,806
and scheduling notification

184
00:08:44,256 --> 00:08:46,746
On watchOS, we continue

of forwarding notifications

to their Watch, but

187
00:08:52,856 --> 00:08:54,786
we now let your WatchOS

188

to be connected to your device,

192

and your applications can

193
00:09:08,536 --> 00:09:12,076
For example, you have the

194
00:09:12,076 --> 00:09:14,356
of your application

195
00:09:14,446 --> 00:09:15,976
but forgot their device behind.

196
00:09:16,456 --> 00:09:18,266
You can still send

00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:19,646
of when they meet

198
00:09:19,736 --> 00:09:22,246

to badging app icons for both

This can be used

205

For example, if your

Let's continue and dive into

216
00:10:14,676 --> 00:10:18,206
How does your application

217
00:10:18,406 --> 00:10:20,246
to the user's device

218
00:10:21,116 --> 00:10:24,256
Well, even before you can

219
00:10:24,536 --> 00:10:27,096
that your application needs

220
00:10:27,806 --> 00:10:31,326
Let's take a look at

221
00:10:31,486 --> 00:10:34,536
Now notifications are an

222
00:10:34,646 --> 00:10:37,336
So it's very important you

223
00:10:37,336 --> 00:10:39,996
and permission before you

224
00:10:40,466 --> 00:10:44,246
So you can ask them permission

225
00:10:44,246 --> 00:10:47,236
or badging the app icon and the

226
00:10:47,236 --> 00:10:49,276
user gets prompted

227
00:10:49,986 --> 00:10:53,096
You need to do this registration

228
00:10:53,096 --> 00:10:54,086
as remote notification.

229
00:10:55,616 --> 00:10:58,796

that you want registration for.

235
00:11:09,976 --> 00:11:11,826
However, do note

236
00:11:11,826 --> 00:11:13,746
that the user might

237
00:11:13,746 --> 00:11:15,946
configurable in the settings

238
00:11:16,536 --> 00:11:20,006
So your application users can

239

to access these user

242

For remote notifications,

247
00:11:42,756 --> 00:11:43,776
for token registration,

248
00:11:44,046 --> 00:11:47,136
which uses the existing

249
00:11:47,676 --> 00:11:49,706
So you register for

250
00:11:50,576 --> 00:11:53,796
you need a network connection so

251
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:55,656
to APNs for this registration

252
00:11:55,656 --> 00:11:57,176
for your device and

253
00:11:58,316 --> 00:12:00,886
This token gets returned to

254
00:11:58,316 --> 00:12:00,886
This token gets returned to

255
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:02,316
which then you need to forward

256
00:12:02,316 --> 00:12:03,676
to your servicer-side

257
00:12:04,406 --> 00:12:07,286
Now this is important because

258
00:12:07,286 --> 00:12:09,096
as part of the notification

259
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:11,466
that your remote side

260
00:12:11,466 --> 00:12:12,106
through your APNs.

261
00:12:12,846 --> 00:12:16,556
Because this token acts as the

262
00:12:16,726 --> 00:12:19,356
and the application to which it

263
00:12:21,316 --> 00:12:22,686
So that was registration.

264
00:12:22,966 --> 00:12:24,476
Now your application is ready

00:12:24,476 --> 00:12:26,516
to start sending

266
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:28,066

00:12:28,066 --> 00:12:31,346
after that is create the

Let's take a look at how

280
00:13:03,676 --> 00:13:08,866
So it's as simple as creating

281
00:13:08,866 --> 00:13:11,896

Your notification payload

00:13:19,986 --> 00:13:24,356
of your payload before

on how to set these up in the

So now that your content

296
00:13:55,406 --> 00:13:57,666
that your app needs to

297
00:13:57,666 --> 00:13:58,586
to send the notification.

298
00:13:59,036 --> 00:14:00,706
And for that there are triggers.

299
00:13:59,036 --> 00:14:00,706
And for that there are triggers.

300
00:14:02,276 --> 00:14:05,686
In iOS 10 we support four

301
00:14:06,016 --> 00:14:08,836
timer interval, calendar,

302
00:14:10,156 --> 00:14:13,086
Now the push trigger is

00:14:13,146 --> 00:14:14,366
with remote notifications

304
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:16,446
when your remote side

305
00:14:16,446 --> 00:14:19,846

Now, time interval based

309
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:32,996
notification at a certain time

310
00:14:33,506 --> 00:14:35,556
For example, if you wanted

311
00:14:35,556 --> 00:14:36,496
in two minutes from now,

312
00:14:36,956 --> 00:14:39,766
or you want to send it every

313
00:14:40,616 --> 00:14:43,016
This also lets you schedule

314
00:14:43,016 --> 00:14:44,486
by setting the time

315
00:14:46,336 --> 00:14:48,596
Now as opposed to time interval

316
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:51,556
calendar triggers that

317
00:14:51,696 --> 00:14:53,846
at a specific date and

318
00:14:53,936 --> 00:14:56,086

319
00:14:56,086 --> 00:14:57,266
when the notification gets sent.

324
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:12,556

in relation to Bluetooth

00:15:15,736 --> 00:15:16,706
if your device is entering

327
00:15:16,706 --> 00:15:19,136
or leaving the region you can

328
00:15:20,176 --> 00:15:23,266
Examples of this is when the

329
00:15:23,266 --> 00:15:25,316
and the device is

330
00:15:25,736 --> 00:15:27,596
or say that the user

331
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:28,816
and your application wants

00:15:28,816 --> 00:15:30,256
to send them a coupon

So those are the different

334
00:15:34,586 --> 00:15:35,336
of this new framework.

00:15:36,266 --> 00:15:38,776
Now that your content's ready

336
00:15:38,776 --> 00:15:39,766
to send the notification,

337
00:15:40,156 --> 00:15:42,756
the next step left is

338
00:15:42,756 --> 00:15:43,436
with the system.

339
00:15:44,896 --> 00:15:49,266

on the UUserNotificationCenter

341
00:15:52,146 --> 00:15:54,546
Which then on the trigger

342
00:15:54,546 --> 00:15:55,686
notification to the user.

your service-side application

346
00:16:03,576 --> 00:16:05,406
which does a best effort

347
00:16:05,406 --> 00:16:07,256
notification to the

348
00:16:08,536 --> 00:16:10,436
So let's summarize this

349
00:16:10,496 --> 00:16:12,096
that we've talked about so far.

350
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:15,676
Your application starts out by

351
00:16:16,886 --> 00:16:20,426
Then it creates the content,

352
00:16:20,426 --> 00:16:21,476
to send the notification

353
00:16:22,006 --> 00:16:23,556
and finally schedules

354
00:16:23,556 --> 00:16:24,836
with the system leading

355
00:16:24,836 --> 00:16:27,386
to the notification getting

356
00:16:27,516 --> 00:16:29,506
It's as simple as that.

357
00:16:29,586 --> 00:16:31,306
Let's take a look at

358
00:16:32,496 --> 00:16:36,056
Start out by doing registration,

359
00:16:37,136 --> 00:16:39,136
you create the content

360
00:16:39,176 --> 00:16:43,536
You create the trigger, in this

361
00:16:43,536 --> 00:16:46,736
based trigger, and then

362
00:16:46,776 --> 00:16:49,496
in a UNNotificationRequest

363
00:16:49,736 --> 00:16:51,186
passing a unique identifier,

364
00:16:51,736 --> 00:16:53,286
which will be important

365
00:16:53,286 --> 00:16:54,106
about later in this session.

366
00:16:54,926 --> 00:16:57,546
And then you schedule this

367
00:16:58,306 --> 00:17:00,006
completing the notification's

368
00:16:58,306 --> 00:17:00,006
completing the notification's

369
00:17:02,786 --> 00:17:04,646
So, so far we've talked

370
00:17:04,646 --> 00:17:07,215
to a notification while your

371
00:17:07,376 --> 00:17:08,955
and the user's not

372
00:17:09,096 --> 00:17:11,236
but what if your application

373
00:17:11,276 --> 00:17:13,036
when it receives a notification?

374
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:15,455
And for this we do offer support

375
00:17:15,626 --> 00:17:17,826
for notification handling while

376
00:17:19,215 --> 00:17:20,016
Your application needs

377
00:17:20,016 --> 00:17:22,165
to implement the

378
00:17:22,165 --> 00:17:22,646
delegate.

379
00:17:23,256 --> 00:17:25,616
And it has a method of

380
00:17:25,976 --> 00:17:28,796
which lets you get the

381
00:17:28,796 --> 00:17:32,076
of the UNNotification object

382
00:17:32,966 --> 00:17:34,956
Now this method also

383
00:17:35,076 --> 00:17:36,896
which must be called at

384
00:17:38,186 --> 00:17:40,556
One thing to note is that

385
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:42,156
presentation options parameters.

386
00:17:43,516 --> 00:17:46,086
Now, what this enables you to

387
00:17:46,086 --> 00:17:47,106
that we talked about earlier.

388
00:17:48,106 --> 00:17:50,456
Let's see an example of how

389
00:17:51,526 --> 00:17:55,576
So, say your application still

390
00:17:55,816 --> 00:17:58,066
as well as your sound alert

391
00:17:58,066 --> 00:17:58,636
in foreground.

392
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:01,266
So this is as simple as

393
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:01,266
So this is as simple as

394
00:18:01,356 --> 00:18:02,676
with these different parameters.

395
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:04,966
And if you don't want

396
00:18:04,966 --> 00:18:06,376
you just don't pass

397
00:18:07,396 --> 00:18:10,206
So that was notification

398
00:18:10,206 --> 00:18:11,086
is in foreground.

399
00:18:11,996 --> 00:18:14,876
Let's move on and talk about

400
00:18:15,766 --> 00:18:18,086
Now notification management

401
00:18:18,446 --> 00:18:22,496
and what this allows you to do

402
00:18:22,576 --> 00:18:24,006
that are pending delivery

403
00:18:24,006 --> 00:18:27,236
for your locally scheduled

404
00:18:27,236 --> 00:18:28,396
to delivered notification

405
00:18:28,696 --> 00:18:31,086
that the user might

406
00:18:31,086 --> 00:18:32,216
or remove notifications.

407
00:18:32,886 --> 00:18:34,866
Now you can also

408
00:18:34,866 --> 00:18:38,166
that have already been sent

409
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:39,556
and promote these notifications.

410
00:18:40,896 --> 00:18:42,056
And important piece

411
00:18:42,056 --> 00:18:44,766
of notification management

412
00:18:45,636 --> 00:18:49,686
Now, in the summary you saw that

413
00:18:49,686 --> 00:18:51,226
on the notification

414
00:18:51,766 --> 00:18:54,916
And for remote notifications

415
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:57,886
APNs collapse id that you

416
00:18:59,006 --> 00:19:01,286
The system uses this

417
00:18:59,006 --> 00:19:01,286
The system uses this

418
00:19:01,286 --> 00:19:03,406
which notification

419
00:19:03,406 --> 00:19:04,626
to be removed or updated.

420
00:19:05,816 --> 00:19:06,426
Let's take a look

421
00:19:06,426 --> 00:19:08,226
at notification management

422
00:19:09,396 --> 00:19:12,436
Say your application wants to

423
00:19:12,826 --> 00:19:14,006
and it wants to send

424
00:19:14,006 --> 00:19:15,076
for the start time of the game.

425
00:19:15,956 --> 00:19:19,266
So you start out by creating

426
00:19:20,406 --> 00:19:21,776
and scheduling it

427
00:19:22,226 --> 00:19:23,586
but say that the

428
00:19:23,976 --> 00:19:27,336
So this is as simple as calling

429
00:19:27,336 --> 00:19:30,746
Request, passing it the

430
00:19:30,746 --> 00:19:32,656
that you created for the

431
00:19:33,836 --> 00:19:35,726
But what if the game

432
00:19:36,556 --> 00:19:38,616
Then you create a new request,

433
00:19:39,326 --> 00:19:40,816
giving it the exact

434
00:19:40,816 --> 00:19:44,726
for the initial request,

435
00:19:45,396 --> 00:19:46,876
and just scheduling

436
00:19:47,446 --> 00:19:49,716
And this in turn leads to

437
00:19:50,206 --> 00:19:54,236
Let's continue this example

438
00:19:54,456 --> 00:19:56,286
and talk about score updates.

439
00:19:57,596 --> 00:19:58,376
Again, you just start

440
00:19:58,376 --> 00:20:00,546
out by creating this

441
00:19:58,376 --> 00:20:00,546
out by creating this

442
00:20:01,456 --> 00:20:02,626
and sending it to the system.

443
00:20:03,526 --> 00:20:05,326
But say that the wrong

444
00:20:06,536 --> 00:20:08,766
then you can simple

445
00:20:08,856 --> 00:20:10,726
by calling

446
00:20:11,206 --> 00:20:12,786
giving it the same identifier.

447
00:20:14,716 --> 00:20:16,726
And what if the score

448
00:20:16,726 --> 00:20:18,666
which of course is a very

449
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:21,856
So all you can do in

450
00:20:21,856 --> 00:20:25,156
notification request, giving

451
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:27,696
passing it the new

452
00:20:28,056 --> 00:20:30,346
and then simply scheduling

453
00:20:31,746 --> 00:20:34,316
Now, what this means, let's

454
00:20:34,596 --> 00:20:36,646
say that notification

455
00:20:36,646 --> 00:20:37,836
for initial score update.

456
00:20:38,526 --> 00:20:42,006
So by calling update, as I

457
00:20:42,006 --> 00:20:45,416
to is that that notification

458
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:46,506
in the notification list,

459
00:20:46,756 --> 00:20:48,246
replacing the original

460
00:20:48,586 --> 00:20:51,266
so that you're not cluttering

461
00:20:51,266 --> 00:20:51,596
at all.

00:20:58,556 --> 00:21:01,606
And you can use this in multiple

464
00:20:58,556 --> 00:21:01,606
And you can use this in multiple

465
00:21:01,966 --> 00:21:03,246
that is right for

466
00:21:04,316 --> 00:21:05,756
So that was notification

467
00:21:05,996 --> 00:21:08,496
it really gives your

468
00:21:08,756 --> 00:21:10,986
on the notifications that

469
00:21:12,196 --> 00:21:13,716
So so far in this

470
00:21:13,716 --> 00:21:16,206
about how your application

471
00:21:16,206 --> 00:21:16,786
to the users.

472
00:21:17,266 --> 00:21:19,326
But what about the other

473
00:21:19,886 --> 00:21:22,456
Notifications are very

474
00:21:22,456 --> 00:21:24,636
of default actions as

475
00:21:24,716 --> 00:21:26,716
that your applications

476
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:30,576
So, to talk about notification

&gt;&gt; Hi everyone.

481
00:21:42,716 --> 00:21:43,316
I'm Julien.

482
00:21:43,316 --> 00:21:46,006
I am a software engineer

483
00:21:46,816 --> 00:21:49,036
Kritarth showed you the web flow

484
00:21:49,036 --> 00:21:51,056
with the current user

485
00:21:51,506 --> 00:21:54,036
from registration up to the time

486
00:21:54,036 --> 00:21:56,106
when notifications are

487
00:21:57,356 --> 00:21:59,126
So now let's talk

488
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:01,646
that the user can take

489
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:01,646
that the user can take

490
00:22:02,616 --> 00:22:04,076
There are three types of actions

491
00:22:04,316 --> 00:22:06,606
that your applications

492
00:22:08,836 --> 00:22:11,106
The first one is

493
00:22:11,756 --> 00:22:14,806
It is when the user opens

494
00:22:16,246 --> 00:22:18,556
This can be done when

495
00:22:18,556 --> 00:22:21,266
and the user receives a

496
00:22:21,316 --> 00:22:23,546
on the banner, which

497
00:22:24,496 --> 00:22:27,786
It can also be done from the

498
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:32,506
from left to right, as well

499
00:22:32,906 --> 00:22:35,806
when the user swipes down to

500
00:22:36,226 --> 00:22:38,196
they can tap on any

501
00:22:38,596 --> 00:22:39,596
to open your application.

502
00:22:42,506 --> 00:22:45,006
Now the second type of

503
00:22:45,516 --> 00:22:47,746
And they are within the

504
00:22:48,456 --> 00:22:51,426
We introduced actionable

505
00:22:52,256 --> 00:22:53,866
and they provide

506
00:22:53,866 --> 00:22:57,136
to execute an action

507
00:22:57,726 --> 00:22:59,766
without the need of

508
00:23:01,486 --> 00:23:04,346
Now these custom actions,

509
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:07,386
with customizable title below

510
00:23:09,196 --> 00:23:12,636
In iOS 9 we introduced

511
00:23:13,046 --> 00:23:16,346
so that the user can for example

512
00:23:17,006 --> 00:23:18,786
of directly from

513
00:23:19,316 --> 00:23:25,526
And these custom actions can be

514
00:23:26,126 --> 00:23:29,046
A background action will

515
00:23:29,496 --> 00:23:31,796
and give you a short amount

516
00:23:31,906 --> 00:23:34,576
to process that custom action

517
00:23:35,616 --> 00:23:38,826
On the other hand, a foreground

518
00:23:38,826 --> 00:23:42,036
notification and launch your

519
00:23:42,036 --> 00:23:43,756
so that you can process

520
00:23:46,336 --> 00:23:48,406
Now these custom

521
00:23:48,406 --> 00:23:50,126
on both iOS and watchOS.

522
00:23:52,116 --> 00:23:55,406
So first, let's take a look

523
00:23:56,856 --> 00:23:59,156
Here we have an example

524
00:23:59,886 --> 00:24:02,576
On this device, the

525
00:23:59,886 --> 00:24:02,576
On this device, the

526
00:24:02,966 --> 00:24:04,236
to expand a notification.

527
00:24:04,716 --> 00:24:08,836
When they do so the custom

528
00:24:08,836 --> 00:24:09,866
notification content.

529
00:24:10,666 --> 00:24:11,596
And some of these actions,

530
00:24:11,596 --> 00:24:13,386
as you can see can

531
00:24:13,736 --> 00:24:19,336
so the user can quickly

532
00:24:19,496 --> 00:24:23,396
Now on watchOS, same

533
00:24:23,786 --> 00:24:25,726
appear below the

534
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:30,246
and some of these actions can

535
00:24:30,786 --> 00:24:32,926
And on the watchOS, you

536
00:24:32,926 --> 00:24:36,436
to provide some suggestions that

537
00:24:37,176 --> 00:24:38,326
for your text input action.

538
00:24:40,156 --> 00:24:42,796
Now for more information

539
00:24:42,796 --> 00:24:46,436
on watchOS you can attend the

540
00:24:46,436 --> 00:24:50,926
for watchOS Session later today.

541
00:24:51,116 --> 00:24:51,936
So now that we've talked

542
00:24:51,936 --> 00:24:54,466
about what the custom

543
00:24:54,866 --> 00:24:57,616
Let's first talk about how you

544
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:59,446
and then present

545
00:25:00,016 --> 00:25:05,096
So for registration, the first

546
00:25:05,096 --> 00:25:06,396
to create an action object.

547
00:25:07,046 --> 00:25:10,046
You give it a unique

548
00:25:10,746 --> 00:25:13,096
The title will appear on

549
00:25:13,096 --> 00:25:15,896
that we previously saw.

550
00:25:16,036 --> 00:25:18,336
Action will be by

551
00:25:18,876 --> 00:25:21,086
but you can also provide some

552
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:24,236
to be a foreground action.

553
00:25:24,236 --> 00:25:25,826
Now, all your actions they need

554
00:25:25,826 --> 00:25:27,716
to be associated

555
00:25:28,716 --> 00:25:30,946
The category requires

556
00:25:31,846 --> 00:25:33,936
You give it all the

557
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:37,376
You can also provide now

558
00:25:38,846 --> 00:25:40,746
for more information

559
00:25:41,506 --> 00:25:43,566
you can attend the

560
00:25:44,756 --> 00:25:45,946
There are also some options

561
00:25:45,946 --> 00:25:47,446
that you can provide

562
00:25:48,016 --> 00:25:50,206
We will talk about one

563
00:25:52,276 --> 00:25:54,166
Now, once you've

564
00:25:54,166 --> 00:25:57,176
and all your categories, the

565
00:25:57,176 --> 00:25:57,966
to register them

566
00:25:58,226 --> 00:26:01,406
to the UNUserNotificationCenter

567
00:25:58,226 --> 00:26:01,406
to the UNUserNotificationCenter

568
00:26:01,406 --> 00:26:02,326
with your application.

569
00:26:05,006 --> 00:26:07,516
Now let's talk about how you

570
00:26:07,516 --> 00:26:08,036
to your user.

571
00:26:09,166 --> 00:26:12,586
You can do so from both remote

572
00:26:14,616 --> 00:26:16,836
So first for remote

573
00:26:17,336 --> 00:26:20,836
the only thing you need to do

574
00:26:20,836 --> 00:26:24,406
in the APS dictionary of the

575
00:26:25,296 --> 00:26:28,606
Now this identifier needs to

576
00:26:28,746 --> 00:26:30,956
for the categories you

577
00:26:33,746 --> 00:26:36,426
For local notifications

578
00:26:36,426 --> 00:26:38,006
to set the category identifier

579
00:26:38,476 --> 00:26:40,876
on the mutable content

580
00:26:41,396 --> 00:26:44,406
Same thing this identifier

581
00:26:44,406 --> 00:26:49,376
that you [inaudible] before.

582
00:26:49,546 --> 00:26:51,226
Now let's talk about

583
00:26:51,226 --> 00:26:53,446
that your app can be aware

584
00:26:53,986 --> 00:26:58,186
Now the dismiss action is

585
00:26:58,186 --> 00:27:00,776
when the user dismisses

586
00:26:58,186 --> 00:27:00,776
when the user dismisses

587
00:27:02,286 --> 00:27:04,396
You could use this

588
00:27:04,396 --> 00:27:06,016
you have a calendar application

589
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:09,356
and let's say you send a remote

590
00:27:09,356 --> 00:27:11,306
about an upcoming meeting.

591
00:27:12,066 --> 00:27:13,616
The user looks at

592
00:27:14,156 --> 00:27:16,786
and decides to dismiss it.

593
00:27:17,056 --> 00:27:18,816
When in this case you might want

594
00:27:18,816 --> 00:27:21,906
to stop sending other remote

595
00:27:21,906 --> 00:27:24,276
of this user since they have

596
00:27:26,036 --> 00:27:29,096
Now, how can the user actually

597
00:27:29,986 --> 00:27:33,056
Well they can do that on

598
00:27:33,056 --> 00:27:36,106
from right to left, and

599
00:27:38,836 --> 00:27:42,356
They can also do that from the

600
00:27:42,356 --> 00:27:45,096
from right to left as well,

601
00:27:45,096 --> 00:27:46,786
which will dismiss

602
00:27:47,316 --> 00:27:53,166
Now since this is not the

603
00:27:53,166 --> 00:27:56,146
to update for it.

604
00:27:56,406 --> 00:27:57,716
So remember earlier

605
00:27:57,716 --> 00:27:59,776
about the different categories

606
00:28:00,456 --> 00:28:02,666
we talked about some

607
00:28:03,006 --> 00:28:04,586
the customDismissAction option.

608
00:28:07,166 --> 00:28:09,626
So let's look at the

609
00:28:09,626 --> 00:28:10,856
to register our category.

610
00:28:11,806 --> 00:28:12,946
The only thing you

611
00:28:14,196 --> 00:28:16,006
is simply add the

612
00:28:16,466 --> 00:28:17,886
to the options of this category

613
00:28:18,266 --> 00:28:20,516
and your app will

614
00:28:20,516 --> 00:28:22,876
when the result dismisses

615
00:28:23,206 --> 00:28:23,916
with this category.

616
00:28:27,156 --> 00:28:29,576
So let's summarize the actions

617
00:28:30,996 --> 00:28:32,546
The first one is

618
00:28:32,946 --> 00:28:34,756
when the user opens

619
00:28:34,946 --> 00:28:35,936
from the notification.

620
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:39,726
The second one where

621
00:28:39,726 --> 00:28:42,616
within actionable notifications

622
00:28:42,616 --> 00:28:45,256
for the user to execute

623
00:28:45,256 --> 00:28:46,176
from the notification.

624
00:28:47,926 --> 00:28:50,226
And finally the third one

625
00:28:51,006 --> 00:28:53,526
it is new to iOS 10 and

626
00:28:53,566 --> 00:28:56,126
when a user dismisses a

627
00:28:58,516 --> 00:29:04,016
[ Applause ]

628
00:28:58,516 --> 00:29:04,016
[ Applause ]

629
00:29:04,516 --> 00:29:07,516
Now let's talk about how you can

630
00:29:07,516 --> 00:29:10,336
from these actions

631
00:29:11,616 --> 00:29:14,056
So until now we had

632
00:29:14,056 --> 00:29:16,546
on if the user opened the

633
00:29:16,976 --> 00:29:21,746
or if we had custom actions or

634
00:29:21,746 --> 00:29:23,516
from a remote or a

635
00:29:24,536 --> 00:29:27,026
Well now with our new user

636
00:29:27,026 --> 00:29:32,026
we have a single method

637
00:29:32,026 --> 00:29:35,286
of the UNUserNotificationCenter

638
00:29:37,006 --> 00:29:40,756
The method you will need to

639
00:29:40,836 --> 00:29:41,806
with CompletionHandler.

640
00:29:43,636 --> 00:29:46,326
Now let's take a closer

641
00:29:46,936 --> 00:29:48,696
and what you can do with

642
00:29:50,936 --> 00:29:53,496
Your response object has

643
00:29:53,996 --> 00:29:57,266
which can either be the

644
00:29:57,656 --> 00:29:59,816
or any of the custom

645
00:30:01,486 --> 00:30:03,606
It can have a user

646
00:30:03,606 --> 00:30:05,476
if it was a text input action.

647
00:30:05,866 --> 00:30:11,086
It can also have a notification

648
00:30:11,086 --> 00:30:14,126
and the identifier of

649
00:30:14,126 --> 00:30:15,266
as the trigger and the content.

650
00:30:16,236 --> 00:30:19,066
Based on the type of trigger

651
00:30:19,066 --> 00:30:21,316
from a local or a

652
00:30:22,796 --> 00:30:24,986
So this is all with the new

653
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:27,496
you can handle your

654
00:30:30,856 --> 00:30:32,696
Now, let's talk about

655
00:30:33,186 --> 00:30:37,666
This is your current

656
00:30:37,666 --> 00:30:40,216
with remote notification that

657
00:30:41,286 --> 00:30:42,736
You have your service

658
00:30:43,246 --> 00:30:45,436
which sends a remote

659
00:30:45,436 --> 00:30:47,096
to Apple push notification

660
00:30:47,096 --> 00:30:52,386
And then it is delivered to the

661
00:30:52,506 --> 00:30:54,926
Now, maybe some of

662
00:30:54,926 --> 00:30:58,636
where you have your server side

663
00:30:58,926 --> 00:31:01,776
to your iOS application

664
00:30:58,926 --> 00:31:01,776
to your iOS application

665
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:02,816
end-to-end encryption.

666
00:31:04,476 --> 00:31:07,696
Well, wouldn't that be great

667
00:31:07,696 --> 00:31:10,906
to end encryption for your

668
00:31:13,256 --> 00:31:16,116
Well for that in iOS 10

669
00:31:16,116 --> 00:31:17,036
service extension.

670
00:31:18,386 --> 00:31:19,316
So now we are going to talk

671
00:31:19,316 --> 00:31:21,346
about what the service

672
00:31:22,076 --> 00:31:23,716
and then how you can

673
00:31:23,716 --> 00:31:24,526
in your application.

674
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:32,226
Now the service extension is

675
00:31:32,226 --> 00:31:35,366
on iOS 10, which means it

676
00:31:36,546 --> 00:31:41,366
And its main purpose is to

677
00:31:41,536 --> 00:31:44,166
of visible or remote

678
00:31:44,166 --> 00:31:45,086
displayed to the user.

679
00:31:47,006 --> 00:31:49,356
So let's take a look again

680
00:31:49,356 --> 00:31:50,556
for remote notifications.

681
00:31:51,066 --> 00:31:55,126
So you have your server-side

682
00:31:55,126 --> 00:31:56,896
to Apple push notification

683
00:31:56,896 --> 00:31:58,556
and then it is sent

684
00:32:00,236 --> 00:32:02,086
Well, now with the extension,

685
00:32:02,746 --> 00:32:04,256
you're able to modify

686
00:32:04,736 --> 00:32:05,886
between the time you sent it

687
00:32:05,886 --> 00:32:07,966
from your server-side

688
00:32:08,046 --> 00:32:10,496
and the time it is displayed

689
00:32:11,396 --> 00:32:14,556
As you can see in this

690
00:32:14,556 --> 00:32:15,846
as well as a subtitle,

691
00:32:16,396 --> 00:32:18,496
and I modified the body

692
00:32:21,146 --> 00:32:23,836
Now a few more details about

693
00:32:24,156 --> 00:32:26,886
You will get a short execution

694
00:32:26,886 --> 00:32:28,816
for long background

695
00:32:30,526 --> 00:32:35,146
And in case you fail to

696
00:32:35,146 --> 00:32:37,516
in a timely manner, you

697
00:32:38,616 --> 00:32:40,826
In case you still fail to

698
00:32:41,296 --> 00:32:43,876
we will show the original

699
00:32:44,086 --> 00:32:45,526
that you sent to the user.

700
00:32:46,096 --> 00:32:50,596
Now some potential uses of

701
00:32:50,596 --> 00:32:54,706
encryption for your remote

702
00:32:54,706 --> 00:32:57,916
as well add some attachments

703
00:32:57,916 --> 00:32:59,236
to make them even richer.

704
00:33:00,666 --> 00:33:02,856
Now there will be a

705
00:33:02,856 --> 00:33:05,136
that in the Advance

706
00:33:07,696 --> 00:33:10,596
Now let's talk about how you

707
00:33:10,596 --> 00:33:12,506
service extension

708
00:33:13,026 --> 00:33:17,736
The first thing you would need

709
00:33:18,226 --> 00:33:19,136
to add the new target.

710
00:33:20,036 --> 00:33:22,516
You can use the template,

711
00:33:22,516 --> 00:33:24,936
under the application

712
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:27,936
And it is known as the

713
00:33:28,796 --> 00:33:31,596
Now this template

714
00:33:32,726 --> 00:33:37,906
So we are going to take a look

715
00:33:38,176 --> 00:33:41,146
So this class, is a subclass

716
00:33:41,146 --> 00:33:43,336
of the UNNotification

717
00:33:44,626 --> 00:33:45,776
and it has two main methods.

718
00:33:48,316 --> 00:33:52,126
The first method is

719
00:33:53,746 --> 00:33:56,376
Now this method will give

720
00:33:56,376 --> 00:33:58,426
which has the identifier

721
00:33:58,716 --> 00:33:59,686
as well as the content.

722
00:34:01,016 --> 00:34:02,576
Then we have the ContentHandler.

723
00:34:03,076 --> 00:34:05,946
You will need to call this

724
00:34:05,946 --> 00:34:08,466
to present the notification

725
00:34:08,466 --> 00:34:12,585
to provide some content for it.

726
00:34:12,846 --> 00:34:15,846
Now, the second method is

727
00:34:15,846 --> 00:34:17,856
expire, and this will be called

728
00:34:17,856 --> 00:34:20,666
if you cannot provide updated

729
00:34:22,056 --> 00:34:25,436
So now remember if you fail

730
00:34:25,436 --> 00:34:29,056
in this method, we will show

731
00:34:29,056 --> 00:34:30,226
content that you sent.

732
00:34:33,606 --> 00:34:36,626
So now let's talk about how you

733
00:34:36,626 --> 00:34:38,136
from a remote notification.

734
00:34:38,706 --> 00:34:43,766
Here, we have a very

735
00:34:43,766 --> 00:34:46,126
of remote notification

736
00:34:47,196 --> 00:34:50,766
And as you can see we have a new

737
00:34:51,786 --> 00:34:54,356
Now, you will need to use this

738
00:34:54,565 --> 00:34:56,426
that you want the service

739
00:34:56,926 --> 00:34:58,926
to update the remote

740
00:35:00,536 --> 00:35:02,836
You do not need to use

741
00:35:03,076 --> 00:35:04,726
only use it when

742
00:35:04,726 --> 00:35:06,606
to replace the content

743
00:35:10,116 --> 00:35:12,826
Now you can see that I also

744
00:35:12,826 --> 00:35:13,416
of my own.

745
00:35:14,106 --> 00:35:16,316
So let's take a look at some

746
00:35:16,316 --> 00:35:18,776
to process this remote

747
00:35:22,336 --> 00:35:26,006
So you can see here we have

748
00:35:26,006 --> 00:35:30,386
and the first thing I do here is

749
00:35:30,466 --> 00:35:32,026
of the remote notification

750
00:35:35,426 --> 00:35:38,106
I then create a

751
00:35:38,266 --> 00:35:43,126
object and I assign the

752
00:35:43,696 --> 00:35:46,246
with the decrypted content

753
00:35:51,496 --> 00:35:54,716
And finally we call

754
00:35:55,176 --> 00:35:57,426
to present the notification

755
00:35:57,956 --> 00:36:01,466
Now, this is how simple it is

756
00:35:57,956 --> 00:36:01,466
Now, this is how simple it is

757
00:36:01,466 --> 00:36:04,796
to implement the new service

758
00:36:06,516 --> 00:36:13,956
[ Applause ]

759
00:36:14,456 --> 00:36:19,016
Now let's recap what

760
00:36:19,186 --> 00:36:21,976
We saw an overview of

761
00:36:21,976 --> 00:36:23,206
and remote notifications.

762
00:36:25,256 --> 00:36:28,266
