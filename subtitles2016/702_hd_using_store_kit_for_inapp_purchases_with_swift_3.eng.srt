00:00:29,356 --> 00:00:30,696
&gt;&gt; So my name is Dana DuBois.

5
00:00:30,696 --> 00:00:32,665
I'm an engineering

6
00:00:32,665 --> 00:00:33,796
that writes the frameworks

7
00:00:33,796 --> 00:00:37,216
that help power the App

8
00:00:37,216 --> 00:00:38,646
And today we're going

9
00:00:38,646 --> 00:00:42,296
of those particular

10
00:00:43,996 --> 00:00:45,056
Many of you know,

11
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:46,966
around for a long, long time.

It was introduced in

00:01:03,326 --> 00:01:05,066
It's really widely used.

19
00:01:05,325 --> 00:01:09,106
And we've talked about

20
00:01:09,106 --> 00:01:12,656
but this year we're going

21
00:01:12,656 --> 00:01:14,696
and we're going to talk

22
00:01:14,736 --> 00:01:15,786
So that's really exciting.

23
00:01:15,786 --> 00:01:17,026
We've got some new APIs.

00:01:18,046 --> 00:01:21,266
There's a couple other things

25

00:01:23,026 --> 00:01:26,036
Last week, many of you probably

27
00:01:26,036 --> 00:01:28,066
of big announcements

00:01:28,066 --> 00:01:30,486
This is something we're

29
00:01:30,796 --> 00:01:34,016
I think a lot of developers are

30
00:01:34,246 --> 00:01:37,376
of these new enhancements

31
00:01:37,376 --> 00:01:39,296

32
00:01:40,816 --> 00:01:43,306
First up, categories.

34
00:01:46,296 --> 00:01:49,666

00:01:53,296 --> 00:01:55,336
There are still going

38
00:01:55,336 --> 00:01:58,166
to be criteria behind how

00:01:58,166 --> 00:02:01,026

00:02:05,256 --> 00:02:07,736
we're giving more

00:02:08,006 --> 00:02:10,336
If you keep your

44
00:02:10,336 --> 00:02:12,276
than one year, that's

45
00:02:12,276 --> 00:02:13,976

47
00:02:18,696 --> 00:02:23,226
Pricing. A lot of control

48
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:26,256
to developers through iTunes

49
00:02:26,256 --> 00:02:28,966
for their subscriptions

50
00:02:28,966 --> 00:02:30,966

52
00:02:33,996 --> 00:02:36,926
in Europe compared to the

53
00:02:36,926 --> 00:02:38,156
that you now have over that.

54
00:02:38,156 --> 00:02:42,306
And then along with pricing,

55
00:02:42,486 --> 00:02:46,966
to save the price, to

56
00:02:47,116 --> 00:02:49,366
who may have already been

57
00:02:49,366 --> 00:02:51,006
adjusting it for new users.

00:02:51,006 --> 00:02:54,076
So, if you have early adopters

59
00:02:54,076 --> 00:02:56,766
and you want to keep them using

60
00:02:56,766 --> 00:03:00,276
to adjust the price for newer

64
00:03:06,406 --> 00:03:08,926
to control exactly what level

65
00:03:08,926 --> 00:03:11,456
of subscription they might

66
00:03:11,456 --> 00:03:14,106
So if they want to go up

67
00:03:14,106 --> 00:03:17,366
or go back down to the basic

68
00:03:17,366 --> 00:03:20,586
in the Manage Subscription

69
00:03:21,256 --> 00:03:25,556

70
00:03:26,006 --> 00:03:27,406
There's a lot more to it.

71
00:03:27,406 --> 00:03:29,356

72
00:03:29,356 --> 00:03:31,406
in your application,

76
00:03:40,716 --> 00:03:43,306
to set this up, how to manage

77
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:45,526
and I really highly

78
00:03:47,046 --> 00:03:48,626
So that's subscriptions.

79
00:03:48,736 --> 00:03:51,536
There's one other new thing that

80
00:03:51,716 --> 00:03:53,616
and that's iMessage apps.

81
00:03:54,096 --> 00:03:56,266
We announced that

82
00:03:56,836 --> 00:03:59,506
We're bringing apps, a whole

83
00:03:59,506 --> 00:04:01,966
into the iMessage app, iMessage.

84
00:03:59,506 --> 00:04:01,966
into the iMessage app, iMessage.

85
00:04:02,246 --> 00:04:07,026
You'll be able to build custom

86
00:04:07,406 --> 00:04:10,816
to allow in-app purchases

87
00:04:10,816 --> 00:04:15,226
right in iMessage aps using the

88
00:04:15,226 --> 00:04:17,036
would use in a normal

89
00:04:17,036 --> 00:04:18,346
that you have in

90
00:04:18,636 --> 00:04:21,196
So if you have additional

91
00:04:21,576 --> 00:04:24,706
or provide right inside

92
00:04:25,396 --> 00:04:26,606
that's now supported.

93
00:04:26,776 --> 00:04:29,006
And this will all be

94
00:04:29,006 --> 00:04:30,806
so that's something we're

95
00:04:30,806 --> 00:04:32,126
and I think developers are going

96
00:04:32,126 --> 00:04:34,986
to take a lot of

97
00:04:35,506 --> 00:04:38,946
So as I said before, StoreKit's

98
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:41,656
People have been using in-app

99
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:43,316
but maybe some of

100
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:45,136
So I'd like to just

101
00:04:45,456 --> 00:04:47,546
of what exactly in-app

102
00:04:47,866 --> 00:04:51,156
In-app purchases are

103
00:04:51,566 --> 00:04:53,856
that can be bought right

104
00:04:54,556 --> 00:04:57,336
However, to be clear, it's

105
00:04:57,336 --> 00:04:58,696
There's other ways

106
00:04:58,876 --> 00:05:02,036
This is really just about

107
00:04:58,876 --> 00:05:02,036
This is really just about

108
00:05:02,076 --> 00:05:06,116
Now when we're talking about

109
00:05:06,116 --> 00:05:07,356
there's a bunch of

110
00:05:07,356 --> 00:05:09,766
When you're configuring this in

111
00:05:09,766 --> 00:05:11,496
of options and you

112
00:05:11,796 --> 00:05:15,506
that you choose the right

113
00:05:15,756 --> 00:05:17,816
So let's take a look

114
00:05:18,676 --> 00:05:20,196
Consumable products.

115
00:05:20,566 --> 00:05:23,656
Everybody's played a game and

116
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:27,496
currency, or gas in your

117
00:05:27,496 --> 00:05:30,066
that they user's going

118
00:05:30,066 --> 00:05:32,326
and buy again, and

119
00:05:32,326 --> 00:05:34,286
That's what a consumable

120
00:05:35,526 --> 00:05:39,606
A non-consumable product is

121
00:05:39,606 --> 00:05:42,186
it will stick around for as long

122
00:05:42,186 --> 00:05:43,626
They'll be able to restore it.

123
00:05:43,626 --> 00:05:48,006
They'll be able to move

124
00:05:48,326 --> 00:05:49,776
So that's a little different.

125
00:05:49,776 --> 00:05:52,386
And again in a game

126
00:05:52,386 --> 00:05:56,066
or you know some sort of weapon,

127
00:05:56,066 --> 00:05:58,866
or a level, or if you

128
00:05:58,866 --> 00:06:01,896
you might have a basic edition

129
00:05:58,866 --> 00:06:01,896
you might have a basic edition

130
00:06:01,896 --> 00:06:03,676
to offer a pro-edition

131
00:06:03,976 --> 00:06:06,696
That's kind of a

132
00:06:07,596 --> 00:06:10,146
We also have two

133
00:06:10,146 --> 00:06:11,606
when we're talking

134
00:06:11,846 --> 00:06:13,836
There's non-renewing

135
00:06:14,616 --> 00:06:16,636
as the name suggests

136
00:06:16,636 --> 00:06:18,966
that don't automatically

137
00:06:18,966 --> 00:06:22,116
and your application, and

138
00:06:22,116 --> 00:06:23,886
to renew those subscriptions.

139
00:06:24,046 --> 00:06:27,556
But then we also have auto

140
00:06:27,556 --> 00:06:31,726
And these are subscriptions that

141
00:06:31,776 --> 00:06:34,446
on a periodic basis, based

142
00:06:34,446 --> 00:06:36,056
So if it's a monthly

143
00:06:36,546 --> 00:06:39,646
we'll bill the user every month,

144
00:06:39,646 --> 00:06:40,806
into that subscription.

145
00:06:41,296 --> 00:06:46,266
So these are the types,

146
00:06:46,266 --> 00:06:49,036
of adding in-app purchases

147
00:06:49,266 --> 00:06:54,006
So, what I'm going to do is I'm

148
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:56,676
of all the various steps,

149
00:06:56,676 --> 00:06:57,916
into each one and

150
00:06:57,916 --> 00:07:00,116
about how to do this in Swift.

151
00:06:57,916 --> 00:07:00,116
about how to do this in Swift.

152
00:07:00,316 --> 00:07:04,066
And you know exactly what you

153
00:07:04,066 --> 00:07:07,646
as pitfalls, or any concerns

154
00:07:07,646 --> 00:07:10,916
There's a lot of things that

155
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:13,096
when you're developing

156
00:07:13,226 --> 00:07:15,066
A couple of things

157
00:07:15,196 --> 00:07:19,376
So first off you're

158
00:07:19,376 --> 00:07:21,616
out exactly what it is

159
00:07:21,616 --> 00:07:24,216
to the consumer, the

160
00:07:24,216 --> 00:07:28,126
So this is done just by

161
00:07:28,126 --> 00:07:31,396
those in-app identifiers

162
00:07:31,396 --> 00:07:32,636
to the user right

163
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:36,436
Once you have the identifiers,

164
00:07:37,036 --> 00:07:38,816
and you fetch the information,

165
00:07:39,156 --> 00:07:42,456
localized product

166
00:07:42,456 --> 00:07:43,616
to those identifiers.

167
00:07:43,696 --> 00:07:44,446
And that's key.

168
00:07:44,446 --> 00:07:46,086
This is localized information.

169
00:07:46,086 --> 00:07:48,916
This is a global marketplace,

170
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:51,516
that you're displaying

171
00:07:51,826 --> 00:07:55,546
to your users in

172
00:07:56,376 --> 00:07:59,706
And now once you have that

173
00:07:59,706 --> 00:08:01,666
to show off the products.

174
00:07:59,706 --> 00:08:01,666
to show off the products.

175
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:02,446
You're going to market them.

176
00:08:02,446 --> 00:08:03,086
You're going to sell them.

177
00:08:03,236 --> 00:08:05,976
These are your products, this is

178
00:08:05,976 --> 00:08:09,106
to build the best UI you

179
00:08:09,366 --> 00:08:12,806
The users then are going to be

180
00:08:12,806 --> 00:08:14,646
They're going to be you

181
00:08:14,646 --> 00:08:17,126
to select the product

182
00:08:17,466 --> 00:08:20,596
But it's up to you to

183
00:08:20,596 --> 00:08:23,136
for that product and add

184
00:08:23,216 --> 00:08:24,366
And we'll be talking a lot more

185
00:08:24,366 --> 00:08:26,646
about the Payment

186
00:08:27,676 --> 00:08:30,506
As the payment is going through

187
00:08:30,506 --> 00:08:33,076
be notified about that

188
00:08:33,076 --> 00:08:35,676
to have to make some

189
00:08:35,676 --> 00:08:38,226
and that's how you

190
00:08:38,606 --> 00:08:41,686
Finally, when the payment is

191
00:08:41,686 --> 00:08:42,866
that product available.

192
00:08:43,285 --> 00:08:44,896
Give the user what

193
00:08:44,996 --> 00:08:47,916
And then finally tell the

194
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:49,906
with the transaction,

195
00:08:50,156 --> 00:08:51,186
the product's available,

196
00:08:51,256 --> 00:08:53,206
so that's finishing

197
00:08:53,956 --> 00:08:56,316
So those are all the different

198
00:08:56,316 --> 00:08:56,656
Real quick.

199
00:08:56,656 --> 00:08:59,096
We're going to dive into each

200
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:02,336
but first special note

201
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:02,336
but first special note

202
00:09:03,316 --> 00:09:05,206
The Payment Queue is the center

203
00:09:05,206 --> 00:09:07,286
of your in-app purchase

204
00:09:07,546 --> 00:09:11,726
It's the source of truth

205
00:09:11,726 --> 00:09:14,626
and payments as they're

206
00:09:14,626 --> 00:09:18,146
from when the user selected that

207
00:09:19,146 --> 00:09:21,886
And it's important to keep

208
00:09:21,886 --> 00:09:25,896
on the queue and only the queue

209
00:09:25,896 --> 00:09:29,146
that are progress,

210
00:09:29,576 --> 00:09:32,146
and if you're using

211
00:09:32,386 --> 00:09:34,946
the Payment Queue will tell

212
00:09:36,896 --> 00:09:41,446
And then another thing

213
00:09:41,446 --> 00:09:44,676
that if the Payment Queue

214
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:46,866
it's a valid and real payment.

215
00:09:47,496 --> 00:09:50,746
In fact, there are

216
00:09:50,746 --> 00:09:53,836
where developers might

217
00:09:54,426 --> 00:09:57,636
where they've noticed that a

218
00:09:57,976 --> 00:09:59,946
and they're managing

219
00:10:00,446 --> 00:10:02,166
And then their app will crash,

220
00:10:02,256 --> 00:10:03,796
or something will

221
00:10:03,796 --> 00:10:06,216
the user will close the

222
00:10:06,216 --> 00:10:09,646
payment, and they'll come back

223
00:10:09,646 --> 00:10:11,496
that they were purchasing

224
00:10:11,846 --> 00:10:14,856
And they don't necessarily

225
00:10:14,856 --> 00:10:17,176
from the Payment Queue

226
00:10:17,176 --> 00:10:18,456
to those payment transactions

227
00:10:18,456 --> 00:10:21,636
because their own queue no

228
00:10:22,196 --> 00:10:25,266
So you should really just

229
00:10:25,266 --> 00:10:27,946
to tell what's going

230
00:10:27,946 --> 00:10:28,706
as they're happening.

231
00:10:28,926 --> 00:10:32,336
And in fact it's very

232
00:10:32,336 --> 00:10:34,396
into some code here, to listen

233
00:10:34,506 --> 00:10:38,736
and observe the Payment Queue

234
00:10:38,736 --> 00:10:40,916
This can be done in the

235
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:43,316
we have

236
00:10:43,316 --> 00:10:45,556
the first thing that

237
00:10:45,556 --> 00:10:49,746
when it starts up and we create

238
00:10:49,746 --> 00:10:51,626
in this case it's the

239
00:10:51,816 --> 00:10:53,336
And we set it right

240
00:10:53,336 --> 00:10:54,806
we add it to the Payment Queue.

241
00:10:55,116 --> 00:10:58,616
And then if there's

242
00:10:58,766 --> 00:11:00,746
that may have been there

243
00:10:58,766 --> 00:11:00,746
that may have been there

244
00:11:00,966 --> 00:11:02,776
we'll get notified

245
00:11:03,436 --> 00:11:07,486
Another kind of case that comes

246
00:11:07,486 --> 00:11:10,786
that have in-app purchases

247
00:11:11,026 --> 00:11:13,476
So the user might have

248
00:11:13,476 --> 00:11:16,916
and redeemed that in-app

249
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:17,346
of your app.

250
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:20,726
The user then is exciting about

251
00:11:21,006 --> 00:11:23,866
they launch your application,

252
00:11:23,866 --> 00:11:26,996
to the Payment Queue that

253
00:11:27,656 --> 00:11:30,166
You got to do it right

254
00:11:30,736 --> 00:11:33,756
So that's a quick note

255
00:11:34,436 --> 00:11:37,816
Let's get back into the process

256
00:11:37,816 --> 00:11:39,256
to add this to your application.

257
00:11:40,326 --> 00:11:44,386
So the first thing you want

258
00:11:44,626 --> 00:11:46,216
for your in-app purchases.

259
00:11:46,866 --> 00:11:48,796
These are the same identifiers

260
00:11:48,796 --> 00:11:50,776
that you set up in

261
00:11:51,016 --> 00:11:53,056
You define them, you name them.

262
00:11:53,376 --> 00:11:54,826
And you just need to

263
00:11:55,366 --> 00:11:56,656
There's a couple

264
00:11:56,656 --> 00:11:58,026
if your app is very simple,

265
00:11:58,436 --> 00:12:00,506
you might just bake

266
00:11:58,436 --> 00:12:00,506
you might just bake

267
00:12:00,506 --> 00:12:02,276
into your application.

268
00:12:02,276 --> 00:12:05,186
If you have an application

269
00:12:05,186 --> 00:12:08,146
and a pro version, you might

270
00:12:08,206 --> 00:12:10,286
and you just baked it right

271
00:12:10,706 --> 00:12:13,876
However, we've seen more and

272
00:12:14,136 --> 00:12:16,036
where they're interested

273
00:12:16,036 --> 00:12:18,576
and fetching those in-app

274
00:12:18,576 --> 00:12:19,866
that they provide so that

275
00:12:19,866 --> 00:12:22,346
over time maybe they can

276
00:12:22,346 --> 00:12:26,526
to the users, or exactly

277
00:12:27,486 --> 00:12:28,476
That's okay to do.

278
00:12:28,476 --> 00:12:29,936
Completely valid to do.

279
00:12:30,016 --> 00:12:32,166
The thing we want to call

280
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:36,246
that make sure your host

281
00:12:36,246 --> 00:12:39,386
This is the beginning of

282
00:12:39,626 --> 00:12:42,466
The worst thing to show a user

283
00:12:42,466 --> 00:12:44,026
while they're waiting

284
00:12:44,566 --> 00:12:49,016
This should be, and if you can

285
00:12:49,496 --> 00:12:51,696
If you can cache on the

286
00:12:51,956 --> 00:12:54,446
Be very cognizant of

287
00:12:54,446 --> 00:12:56,156
and preserving these

288
00:12:56,866 --> 00:13:00,586
Now that you have the

289
00:12:56,866 --> 00:13:00,586
Now that you have the

290
00:13:00,586 --> 00:13:04,056
to the App Store to fetch the

291
00:13:04,086 --> 00:13:05,746
associated with those products.

292
00:13:07,006 --> 00:13:09,666
This can be done with

293
00:13:09,966 --> 00:13:12,476
You pass in the identifiers

294
00:13:12,946 --> 00:13:15,426
Again, for the smoothest

295
00:13:15,426 --> 00:13:16,726
you want to do this in advance.

296
00:13:16,726 --> 00:13:19,506
You want to anticipate when

297
00:13:19,506 --> 00:13:21,476
in looking at your

298
00:13:21,636 --> 00:13:26,046
and have that information

299
00:13:26,156 --> 00:13:28,826
So first thing you do, create

300
00:13:29,056 --> 00:13:31,236
You pass in the identifiers

301
00:13:32,296 --> 00:13:33,136
You set your delegate.

302
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:35,536
This will give information

303
00:13:35,536 --> 00:13:39,206
about when those

304
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:40,766
And then you just call start.

305
00:13:40,936 --> 00:13:41,646
That simple.

306
00:13:44,616 --> 00:13:47,366
The delegate looks like this.

307
00:13:47,746 --> 00:13:50,166
We have product request,

308
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:52,026
This will pass in

309
00:13:52,026 --> 00:13:53,926
that you requested

310
00:13:54,196 --> 00:13:56,386
And each of those products

311
00:13:56,386 --> 00:13:58,816
like a localized

312
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:01,496
As I said before this is

313
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:01,496
As I said before this is

314
00:14:01,496 --> 00:14:04,696
you're marketing your in-app

315
00:14:05,096 --> 00:14:06,286
So it's important to make sure

316
00:14:06,286 --> 00:14:09,426
that you're actually using

317
00:14:09,636 --> 00:14:11,216
to make your sales.

318
00:14:11,306 --> 00:14:13,436
So localized title

319
00:14:14,616 --> 00:14:17,916
even more important is

320
00:14:18,096 --> 00:14:20,806
You want to present the user the

321
00:14:20,996 --> 00:14:22,336
and you want to make

322
00:14:22,336 --> 00:14:24,736
in a format that

323
00:14:24,996 --> 00:14:29,316
Currency is represented

324
00:14:29,906 --> 00:14:33,186
and you know it's important

325
00:14:33,186 --> 00:14:35,606
We'll get into that in a moment.

326
00:14:36,576 --> 00:14:40,136
And then finally if you're

327
00:14:40,136 --> 00:14:43,086
content, this is something that

328
00:14:43,086 --> 00:14:45,566
we actually give information

329
00:14:45,566 --> 00:14:47,346
about the download

330
00:14:47,346 --> 00:14:50,216
and versions associated

331
00:14:50,636 --> 00:14:52,546
So as I mentioned the

332
00:14:52,546 --> 00:14:58,666
that you do the right thing when

333
00:14:58,986 --> 00:15:01,396
When you're presenting those

334
00:14:58,986 --> 00:15:01,396
When you're presenting those

335
00:15:01,396 --> 00:15:05,166
that price locale and pass that

336
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:06,936
and that will get

337
00:15:07,036 --> 00:15:08,666
about that pricing information.

338
00:15:08,906 --> 00:15:12,026
That NS number formatter, will

339
00:15:12,206 --> 00:15:13,956
take the locale associated

340
00:15:13,956 --> 00:15:16,696
If you set it to a currency

341
00:15:16,696 --> 00:15:18,746
that you're getting that

342
00:15:19,206 --> 00:15:22,556
The other thing you want to do

343
00:15:22,556 --> 00:15:24,356
of currency conversion

344
00:15:24,396 --> 00:15:27,376
The App Store knows

345
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:28,976
convert those currencies.

346
00:15:29,236 --> 00:15:31,206
So you don't need to

347
00:15:31,486 --> 00:15:34,776
Just present the price using

348
00:15:35,316 --> 00:15:37,836
The next step after that

349
00:15:38,226 --> 00:15:39,946
Not really going to talk

350
00:15:40,136 --> 00:15:42,476
these are your products,

351
00:15:42,476 --> 00:15:44,286
You know how to present

352
00:15:44,826 --> 00:15:47,686
to make the best

353
00:15:48,826 --> 00:15:51,346
However, once the

354
00:15:51,936 --> 00:15:56,036
or once the UI has been shown,

355
00:15:56,106 --> 00:15:57,686
into making the purchase itself.

356
00:15:58,036 --> 00:15:59,996
And that can be done by adding

357
00:15:59,996 --> 00:16:02,436
and creating an SK

358
00:15:59,996 --> 00:16:02,436
and creating an SK

359
00:16:02,436 --> 00:16:04,026
and adding it to

360
00:16:04,816 --> 00:16:07,266
Once you've created that SK

361
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:10,316
to the Payment Queue,

362
00:16:10,626 --> 00:16:12,886
as the payment is

363
00:16:13,086 --> 00:16:14,726
through updated transactions.

364
00:16:14,726 --> 00:16:18,016
So this is that Payment Queue

365
00:16:18,016 --> 00:16:19,376
when the application started.

366
00:16:19,766 --> 00:16:21,626
You created your

367
00:16:21,886 --> 00:16:24,256
It called Payment Queue

368
00:16:24,396 --> 00:16:26,976
And you'll get information

369
00:16:26,976 --> 00:16:29,976
through the process so all

370
00:16:29,976 --> 00:16:30,686
SK payment.

371
00:16:31,356 --> 00:16:32,716
Added it to the Payment Queue.

372
00:16:32,716 --> 00:16:36,236
The information started

373
00:16:36,236 --> 00:16:38,986
to get information about all

374
00:16:38,986 --> 00:16:40,566
You might have one,

375
00:16:40,786 --> 00:16:45,246
You should iterate through those

376
00:16:45,246 --> 00:16:47,756
to the state for each

377
00:16:47,966 --> 00:16:49,086
It's a couple different states,

378
00:16:49,086 --> 00:16:50,656
the one you're probably

379
00:16:50,656 --> 00:16:51,936
in is the purchase state.

380
00:16:51,976 --> 00:16:54,906
This is where you know that

381
00:16:55,086 --> 00:16:57,426
and should go ahead and

382
00:16:57,666 --> 00:16:59,696
we'll get into that

383
00:16:59,696 --> 00:17:01,106
and make that content available.

384
00:16:59,696 --> 00:17:01,106
and make that content available.

385
00:17:01,786 --> 00:17:04,675
However, there's one other state

386
00:17:04,915 --> 00:17:07,316
and that's the deferred

387
00:17:07,986 --> 00:17:11,925
Deferred was added

388
00:17:11,925 --> 00:17:14,316
for the Ask to Buy feature.

389
00:17:14,626 --> 00:17:16,945
This was to allow

390
00:17:16,945 --> 00:17:19,685
where children could

391
00:17:19,965 --> 00:17:23,326
such as an in-app purchase,

392
00:17:23,326 --> 00:17:26,366
their approver, will have

393
00:17:26,366 --> 00:17:27,626
that purchase will go through.

394
00:17:27,965 --> 00:17:29,686
The deferred state is the state

395
00:17:29,686 --> 00:17:31,166
that you're in-app

396
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:36,846
on when it's currently pending

397
00:17:37,446 --> 00:17:39,796
One thing we've seen

398
00:17:39,796 --> 00:17:44,006
to make it very clear is you

399
00:17:44,006 --> 00:17:44,966
in the deferred state.

400
00:17:44,966 --> 00:17:46,496
You should handle that in a way

401
00:17:46,786 --> 00:17:50,886
where maybe the purchase

402
00:17:50,886 --> 00:17:53,516
just let the child who's

403
00:17:53,516 --> 00:17:56,446
to use your app make that

404
00:17:56,446 --> 00:17:58,356
and continue to use the game

405
00:17:58,356 --> 00:17:59,906
or whatever it is

406
00:18:00,226 --> 00:18:01,286
Because it might be hours,

407
00:18:01,286 --> 00:18:03,486
it might be days before

408
00:18:03,486 --> 00:18:04,846
and approves that purchase.

409
00:18:05,146 --> 00:18:07,826
So no spinner, no

410
00:18:08,216 --> 00:18:11,636
Just treat deferred state as

411
00:18:11,636 --> 00:18:13,236
you know hasn't even

412
00:18:13,266 --> 00:18:18,616
One thing I also want to get

413
00:18:18,616 --> 00:18:21,796
to test your applications

414
00:18:21,796 --> 00:18:24,466
just like testing your

415
00:18:24,926 --> 00:18:27,826
And this can be done

416
00:18:27,826 --> 00:18:29,226
Sandbox environment.

417
00:18:29,226 --> 00:18:30,986
This is a special environment.

418
00:18:31,306 --> 00:18:33,116
If you're running

419
00:18:33,116 --> 00:18:36,176
and it's a developer signed

420
00:18:36,176 --> 00:18:39,166
that you make will go to

421
00:18:40,126 --> 00:18:46,746
However, if you're interested in

422
00:18:46,746 --> 00:18:49,386
there's really no good

423
00:18:49,606 --> 00:18:52,056
so that you can actually

424
00:18:52,546 --> 00:18:55,686
So if you want to test your

425
00:18:55,996 --> 00:18:59,886
it can be done using

426
00:19:00,246 --> 00:19:04,116
This is where you create your

427
00:19:04,716 --> 00:19:06,046
You pass in that product

428
00:19:06,196 --> 00:19:10,136
and then you set the

429
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:12,976
This is a flag that's going

430
00:19:13,236 --> 00:19:15,626
treat this as if a

431
00:19:15,626 --> 00:19:17,396
and that child was

432
00:19:18,016 --> 00:19:19,956
Once you add it to the

433
00:19:19,956 --> 00:19:22,856
up to the App Store and the

434
00:19:22,856 --> 00:19:25,066
with a deferred state

435
00:19:25,066 --> 00:19:28,436
This is your way of knowing,

436
00:19:28,436 --> 00:19:29,506
when kids are using it.

437
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:34,396
We also should talk a little

438
00:19:34,396 --> 00:19:36,536
Not everything is

439
00:19:36,536 --> 00:19:38,836
There's going to be error

440
00:19:39,366 --> 00:19:41,516
Especially with in-app

441
00:19:41,906 --> 00:19:46,396
One thing to keep in mind is not

442
00:19:46,396 --> 00:19:47,826
I really encourage you to check

443
00:19:47,826 --> 00:19:50,656
out the In-App Purchase

444
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:53,046
or the StoreKit Framework

445
00:19:53,426 --> 00:19:56,066
to get a good sense of

446
00:19:56,066 --> 00:19:59,326
that can be returned in

447
00:20:00,106 --> 00:20:03,526
One thing to keep

448
00:20:03,526 --> 00:20:05,606
of these errors aren't

449
00:20:05,606 --> 00:20:07,956
to inform the user about.

450
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:10,526
Most of these are just errors

451
00:20:10,696 --> 00:20:12,276
to handle in your application.

452
00:20:12,786 --> 00:20:15,496
A great example of that

453
00:20:15,496 --> 00:20:17,636
I'm using your application,

454
00:20:17,636 --> 00:20:19,176
I'm doing a little bit

455
00:20:19,406 --> 00:20:20,616
I click on purchase.

456
00:20:21,046 --> 00:20:24,386
I'll get the price confirmation

457
00:20:24,386 --> 00:20:26,506
And then I change my

458
00:20:26,506 --> 00:20:27,586
and see what else is there.

459
00:20:27,786 --> 00:20:28,746
And I hit cancel.

460
00:20:29,406 --> 00:20:33,646
Cancel error, StoreKit will

461
00:20:33,646 --> 00:20:34,566
to your application.

462
00:20:34,886 --> 00:20:36,576
There's no need to

463
00:20:36,576 --> 00:20:38,676
with a user did cancel alert.

464
00:20:39,026 --> 00:20:41,316
And we'll see this in

465
00:20:41,316 --> 00:20:42,836
The user knows that

466
00:20:43,206 --> 00:20:46,956
There's no reason to

467
00:20:47,516 --> 00:20:49,506
Let StoreKit handle

468
00:20:49,506 --> 00:20:50,496
as much as possible.

469
00:20:50,496 --> 00:20:52,146
Again, we got into

470
00:20:52,146 --> 00:20:55,946
The Payment Queue is where

471
00:20:56,266 --> 00:20:58,026
The App Store and StoreKit

472
00:20:58,086 --> 00:21:01,076
for you will confirm the

473
00:20:58,086 --> 00:21:01,076
for you will confirm the

474
00:21:01,296 --> 00:21:02,506
They'll present a price.

475
00:21:02,976 --> 00:21:05,316
That price should match

476
00:21:05,316 --> 00:21:06,536
So that's why isn't important

477
00:21:06,536 --> 00:21:09,396
to make sure you localize the

478
00:21:09,746 --> 00:21:11,076
We'll authenticate the user.

479
00:21:11,326 --> 00:21:13,456
If there's any issue with

480
00:21:13,456 --> 00:21:14,496
we'll handle that.

481
00:21:14,986 --> 00:21:17,376
No need for you to

482
00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:20,936
or do anything special, let

483
00:21:22,736 --> 00:21:25,836
So we talked a little bit about

484
00:21:25,836 --> 00:21:27,306
and we talked about the states

485
00:21:27,306 --> 00:21:29,356
that can be returned

486
00:21:30,296 --> 00:21:33,216
Once your payment has made

487
00:21:33,246 --> 00:21:35,056
you have a number

488
00:21:35,056 --> 00:21:36,406
to make in your application.

489
00:21:38,776 --> 00:21:42,846
Specifically, around validating

490
00:21:42,906 --> 00:21:45,136
by a real monetary transaction.

491
00:21:45,776 --> 00:21:48,976
So we'll get into a couple

492
00:21:49,336 --> 00:21:51,286
But again, it's your

493
00:21:51,286 --> 00:21:52,426
they're your products.

494
00:21:52,656 --> 00:21:53,836
So it's really important to keep

495
00:21:53,836 --> 00:21:57,466
in mind exactly what

496
00:21:57,686 --> 00:22:01,056
and what level of

497
00:21:57,686 --> 00:22:01,056
and what level of

498
00:22:01,056 --> 00:22:02,926
to validate your purchase.

499
00:22:05,236 --> 00:22:09,646
So receipt validation, this is

500
00:22:09,646 --> 00:22:11,936
to the application at

501
00:22:11,986 --> 00:22:17,596
It's just like a bill that a

502
00:22:17,596 --> 00:22:20,316
at a mall or something

503
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:24,146
It includes all this information

504
00:22:24,146 --> 00:22:25,956
and the purchasing

505
00:22:26,376 --> 00:22:28,456
And there's kind

506
00:22:28,456 --> 00:22:30,736
that you can attack

507
00:22:31,216 --> 00:22:33,586
First is on the device itself.

508
00:22:33,836 --> 00:22:37,826
This receipt comes down, you

509
00:22:37,826 --> 00:22:40,526
on the device to pull

510
00:22:40,766 --> 00:22:43,936
make sure you know authenticate

511
00:22:43,936 --> 00:22:47,196
make sure that it's from

512
00:22:47,696 --> 00:22:51,706
And this can be done

513
00:22:51,706 --> 00:22:54,846
for just unlocking features and

514
00:22:54,846 --> 00:22:56,926
So again, this is one of the

515
00:22:57,206 --> 00:22:59,316
Is this a purely client side,

516
00:22:59,316 --> 00:23:01,446
right inside your

517
00:22:59,316 --> 00:23:01,446
right inside your

518
00:23:01,996 --> 00:23:05,626
Or if you have a server

519
00:23:05,626 --> 00:23:07,896
to actually have the

520
00:23:07,956 --> 00:23:10,066
because you want that

521
00:23:10,066 --> 00:23:11,756
for your content or service.

522
00:23:11,986 --> 00:23:14,896
And this can be done by taking

523
00:23:14,896 --> 00:23:18,396
to the device, uploading it

524
00:23:18,396 --> 00:23:21,716
that server send the receipt

525
00:23:21,896 --> 00:23:25,176
there's a backend API

526
00:23:25,596 --> 00:23:28,316
And that can be done

527
00:23:29,726 --> 00:23:30,976
One note with that though,

528
00:23:30,976 --> 00:23:34,676
is yes the App Store does have

529
00:23:34,676 --> 00:23:39,076
in that receipt and validate

530
00:23:39,076 --> 00:23:41,926
that receipt to that API

531
00:23:42,076 --> 00:23:46,836
That is not a secure

532
00:23:46,836 --> 00:23:50,706
to how trustworthy that can

533
00:23:51,056 --> 00:23:55,086
So if you're going to use

534
00:23:55,086 --> 00:23:57,376
it should really be

535
00:23:57,676 --> 00:23:59,326
right into the App Store itself.

536
00:24:01,676 --> 00:24:04,706
So let's get a little bit

537
00:24:05,686 --> 00:24:09,996
The receipt is a trusted record

538
00:24:10,576 --> 00:24:13,876
It contains information

539
00:24:13,916 --> 00:24:17,326
that this app was bought by

540
00:24:17,646 --> 00:24:21,246
and those in-app were bought

541
00:24:22,096 --> 00:24:23,566
Stored right on the device,

542
00:24:23,566 --> 00:24:27,006
right into the application

543
00:24:27,726 --> 00:24:30,986
It's issued by the App Store and

544
00:24:30,986 --> 00:24:33,636
that allow you to verify

545
00:24:33,636 --> 00:24:35,096
from the App Store itself.

546
00:24:35,706 --> 00:24:39,436
And again, it's for your

547
00:24:39,706 --> 00:24:41,696
If your app is running

548
00:24:41,696 --> 00:24:43,716
on a different device it will

549
00:24:43,716 --> 00:24:45,766
it will get a different

550
00:24:47,356 --> 00:24:50,386
This is kind of, this

551
00:24:50,386 --> 00:24:52,176
of what it looks like.

552
00:24:52,486 --> 00:24:56,006
Again, stored in the app bundle.

553
00:24:56,436 --> 00:24:57,896
We give you an API to get it.

554
00:24:57,896 --> 00:24:59,566
We'll see what that

555
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:02,156
And it's a single file.

556
00:25:02,536 --> 00:25:05,846
Old, old, old versions

557
00:25:05,846 --> 00:25:07,966
to be multiple files for

558
00:25:07,966 --> 00:25:11,086
but since iOS 7 we've

559
00:25:11,086 --> 00:25:13,646
that contains all this

560
00:25:14,216 --> 00:25:17,746
It also, again, contains

561
00:25:17,746 --> 00:25:21,006
to allow you to verify

562
00:25:21,966 --> 00:25:27,216
We do this through a Public

563
00:25:27,216 --> 00:25:28,526
7 Container.

564
00:25:28,726 --> 00:25:31,686
This is the container that

565
00:25:31,686 --> 00:25:33,836
in it and this is

566
00:25:33,876 --> 00:25:36,456
So there's a lot of information

567
00:25:36,776 --> 00:25:40,426
on how to work with

568
00:25:40,936 --> 00:25:43,526
The payload of that container,

569
00:25:43,916 --> 00:25:46,686
the thing that contains

570
00:25:46,686 --> 00:25:49,066
that you're going to be

571
00:25:49,066 --> 00:25:53,066
in an ASN1 format, again

572
00:25:53,766 --> 00:25:57,576
And there's a lot of

573
00:25:57,576 --> 00:26:01,106
for verifying this, OpenSSL

574
00:25:57,576 --> 00:26:01,106
for verifying this, OpenSSL

575
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:03,386
Sometimes people

576
00:26:03,826 --> 00:26:06,226
But again, something

577
00:26:06,226 --> 00:26:08,876
that this is your

578
00:26:08,946 --> 00:26:10,476
this is your business.

579
00:26:10,766 --> 00:26:12,826
So you've got to make

580
00:26:12,826 --> 00:26:15,286
to verify this receipt and

581
00:26:15,286 --> 00:26:15,906
to use.

582
00:26:17,596 --> 00:26:22,466
However, whatever you choose,

583
00:26:22,466 --> 00:26:24,256
that you're going to go through.

584
00:26:24,396 --> 00:26:26,806
First up, is you're going

585
00:26:26,806 --> 00:26:29,266
in the application

586
00:26:30,026 --> 00:26:32,456
And again, this is what

587
00:26:32,506 --> 00:26:35,706
You can call right

588
00:26:36,056 --> 00:26:37,576
and there's an App

589
00:26:37,576 --> 00:26:39,376
that will be returned by that.

590
00:26:39,376 --> 00:26:42,316
This is a local URL,

591
00:26:42,876 --> 00:26:45,606
Once you have that URL,

592
00:26:45,606 --> 00:26:50,336
and you get the binary

593
00:26:50,826 --> 00:26:52,646
Now that you have

594
00:26:52,696 --> 00:26:54,316
a couple things to keep in mind.

595
00:26:55,136 --> 00:26:58,446
The certificates on there

596
00:26:58,446 --> 00:26:59,806
but you've got to

597
00:26:59,806 --> 00:27:01,506
about checking that

598
00:26:59,806 --> 00:27:01,506
about checking that

599
00:27:02,506 --> 00:27:06,896
Just because it was issued at

600
00:27:07,266 --> 00:27:09,576
that that expiration

601
00:27:09,576 --> 00:27:11,036
for all time in the future.

602
00:27:11,596 --> 00:27:13,626
So if you're checking

603
00:27:13,786 --> 00:27:17,496
compare it against to when

604
00:27:17,496 --> 00:27:21,006
from the App Store, not to

605
00:27:21,346 --> 00:27:23,726
It's not like an SSL

606
00:27:23,726 --> 00:27:24,846
to check it every time.

607
00:27:25,176 --> 00:27:29,756
It's only valid for when it

608
00:27:29,756 --> 00:27:31,716
to check the date for

609
00:27:32,226 --> 00:27:34,736
Or it's perfectly valid not

610
00:27:35,086 --> 00:27:37,536
But what you do want

611
00:27:37,536 --> 00:27:40,566
up to the root certificate

612
00:27:41,186 --> 00:27:44,226
That will verify that

613
00:27:44,226 --> 00:27:46,996
That you can trust it

614
00:27:47,756 --> 00:27:48,936
So check up to the root.

615
00:27:48,936 --> 00:27:54,526
So again, this just kind

616
00:27:54,526 --> 00:27:56,606
of what it looks like

617
00:27:57,316 --> 00:28:00,296
The payload of it, that ASN1

618
00:27:57,316 --> 00:28:00,296
The payload of it, that ASN1

619
00:28:00,296 --> 00:28:02,126
about is a series of attributes.

620
00:28:02,126 --> 00:28:04,356
You can think of it

621
00:28:04,586 --> 00:28:06,826
It contains types and values.

622
00:28:07,166 --> 00:28:09,506
And we're going to highlight

623
00:28:09,836 --> 00:28:12,736
There's more in there than

624
00:28:12,736 --> 00:28:14,236
And you can get a

625
00:28:14,236 --> 00:28:16,996
through our Receipt

626
00:28:17,726 --> 00:28:22,646
But some of the main ones you're

627
00:28:22,646 --> 00:28:25,836
and type 3, that includes

628
00:28:25,836 --> 00:28:28,826
and the bundle version that

629
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:32,116
Hopefully that matches

630
00:28:32,166 --> 00:28:32,956
and you should check it.

631
00:28:33,986 --> 00:28:35,876
So you should check

632
00:28:35,986 --> 00:28:37,316
You should check

633
00:28:37,316 --> 00:28:38,576
And then one thing to keep

634
00:28:38,576 --> 00:28:42,916
in mind is you should use hard

635
00:28:42,916 --> 00:28:44,286
binary of your app.

636
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:48,346
It's a lot easier for me to go

637
00:28:48,716 --> 00:28:52,626
if that is what you're using to

638
00:28:52,626 --> 00:28:54,206
for me to change the payload

639
00:28:54,206 --> 00:28:56,456
of your application

640
00:28:56,586 --> 00:28:59,276
So if you really want to make

641
00:28:59,276 --> 00:29:02,436
for your application,

642
00:28:59,276 --> 00:29:02,436
for your application,

643
00:29:04,186 --> 00:29:07,396
Now that you know that this

644
00:29:07,396 --> 00:29:08,206
you want to make sure it is

645
00:29:08,206 --> 00:29:10,616
for the device that's

646
00:29:10,616 --> 00:29:11,036
and there.

647
00:29:11,106 --> 00:29:12,766
And this is a little trickier.

648
00:29:13,006 --> 00:29:17,776
What you want to do is take

649
00:29:17,776 --> 00:29:19,706
that is returned in type 5.

650
00:29:20,516 --> 00:29:22,556
Type 5 contains this hash.

651
00:29:22,786 --> 00:29:26,476
The hash is made up of

652
00:29:26,476 --> 00:29:28,806
that the App Store knows

653
00:29:29,036 --> 00:29:32,476
And pieces of information that

654
00:29:33,176 --> 00:29:35,286
That specifically

655
00:29:36,186 --> 00:29:38,516
So again hard coded value

656
00:29:38,556 --> 00:29:39,736
the bundle ID of your app.

657
00:29:40,296 --> 00:29:41,746
The device identifier.

658
00:29:42,106 --> 00:29:43,736
This is a, there

659
00:29:43,736 --> 00:29:47,456
It's a little different on

660
00:29:47,456 --> 00:29:49,316
to load up that device

661
00:29:49,446 --> 00:29:51,636
And then this Opaque Value.

662
00:29:51,796 --> 00:29:54,636
This Opaque Value is

663
00:29:54,636 --> 00:29:55,896
of cryptographic entropy.

664
00:29:55,896 --> 00:29:58,536
It's a secret salt that is

665
00:29:58,536 --> 00:30:02,116
It allows the hash to change

666
00:29:58,536 --> 00:30:02,116
It allows the hash to change

667
00:30:02,116 --> 00:30:03,926
and the device identifier

668
00:30:04,236 --> 00:30:06,576
You should basically take

669
00:30:06,576 --> 00:30:09,016
in the receipt and

670
00:30:09,626 --> 00:30:14,356
Once you have that, SHA-1

671
00:30:14,356 --> 00:30:17,256
and if they match, you know

672
00:30:18,036 --> 00:30:24,556
And again it's unique to

673
00:30:25,586 --> 00:30:29,726
The receipt also contains

674
00:30:29,726 --> 00:30:31,136
of your in-app purchases.

675
00:30:31,136 --> 00:30:37,376
So what we see here is a whole

676
00:30:37,376 --> 00:30:41,286
Type 17 is for each and every

677
00:30:41,286 --> 00:30:44,326
with your application it

678
00:30:44,636 --> 00:30:45,856
for that in-app purchase.

679
00:30:46,406 --> 00:30:50,116
The pay load for Type

680
00:30:50,116 --> 00:30:53,806
it will actually be

681
00:30:53,856 --> 00:30:56,826
and that will have its

682
00:30:57,296 --> 00:30:59,646
So what do those look like?

683
00:30:59,776 --> 00:31:03,806
Well 1701, that's the

684
00:30:59,776 --> 00:31:03,806
Well 1701, that's the

685
00:31:03,846 --> 00:31:05,916
So we talked about

686
00:31:06,326 --> 00:31:09,406
the user could have

687
00:31:09,406 --> 00:31:12,966
of coins inside your

688
00:31:13,236 --> 00:31:17,666
That's going to be the quantity,

689
00:31:17,666 --> 00:31:19,966
that was made against that

690
00:31:21,156 --> 00:31:23,486
The product identifier, we

691
00:31:23,486 --> 00:31:25,506
This is that identifier

692
00:31:25,506 --> 00:31:30,336
to load your in-app purchase

693
00:31:30,336 --> 00:31:32,626
and what you set them

694
00:31:33,676 --> 00:31:36,606
The identifier, this is

695
00:31:36,606 --> 00:31:39,366
This is a unique identifier for

696
00:31:39,366 --> 00:31:40,436
to make that purchase.

697
00:31:41,406 --> 00:31:43,246
The date of the purchase.

698
00:31:43,856 --> 00:31:47,486
And then finally one

699
00:31:47,486 --> 00:31:50,676
but one thing I want to

700
00:31:50,906 --> 00:31:52,736
for auto-renewing subscriptions,

701
00:31:52,846 --> 00:31:55,326
the subscription

702
00:31:55,826 --> 00:31:58,326
So if you're switching your

703
00:31:58,596 --> 00:31:59,996
that field's important to you.

704
00:32:00,366 --> 00:32:02,446
You're going to use that to

705
00:32:02,446 --> 00:32:04,936
that to know is this

706
00:32:05,156 --> 00:32:11,286
Do we need to ask the user to,

707
00:32:11,286 --> 00:32:13,576
that the user is still

708
00:32:14,036 --> 00:32:15,856
So that field is very important.

709
00:32:17,956 --> 00:32:19,156
And then one other note.

710
00:32:19,376 --> 00:32:21,786
If you have an app that's

711
00:32:22,536 --> 00:32:25,076
and it's a pay for app

712
00:32:25,076 --> 00:32:27,456
in switching it over to

713
00:32:28,146 --> 00:32:31,326
one thing you want to make sure

714
00:32:31,326 --> 00:32:34,306
receipt, the app receipt

715
00:32:34,646 --> 00:32:37,416
This includes the original

716
00:32:37,416 --> 00:32:39,126
that that app was bought with.

717
00:32:39,756 --> 00:32:43,156
So if I bought it as version

718
00:32:43,576 --> 00:32:46,316
and in version 2.0 you

719
00:32:46,746 --> 00:32:49,216
I want to take a look at

720
00:32:50,186 --> 00:32:54,266
because I want to make sure I

721
00:32:54,266 --> 00:32:57,206
that they are and not as

722
00:32:57,576 --> 00:33:00,486
I think it's a really bad

723
00:32:57,576 --> 00:33:00,486
I think it's a really bad

724
00:33:00,486 --> 00:33:03,046
over to subscriptions

725
00:33:03,046 --> 00:33:05,226
that they purchased

726
00:33:05,586 --> 00:33:06,956
So it's important

727
00:33:06,956 --> 00:33:10,466
if you're switching

728
00:33:12,066 --> 00:33:13,646
A couple other notes

729
00:33:13,646 --> 00:33:16,106
The receipt is issued

730
00:33:17,016 --> 00:33:20,196
But it actually is

731
00:33:21,146 --> 00:33:22,216
But it's only renewable

732
00:33:22,216 --> 00:33:25,036
for certain types

733
00:33:25,286 --> 00:33:27,346
So when we're talking

734
00:33:27,346 --> 00:33:31,116
and non-renewing subscriptions,

735
00:33:31,116 --> 00:33:33,326
to be refreshed with

736
00:33:34,136 --> 00:33:38,426
So consumable and nonrenewable

737
00:33:38,426 --> 00:33:41,136
They appear right after

738
00:33:41,136 --> 00:33:45,046
And they're not going to be

739
00:33:45,046 --> 00:33:47,886
that receipt either on that

740
00:33:47,886 --> 00:33:49,006
to a different device.

741
00:33:50,166 --> 00:33:54,466
However, non-consumable and

742
00:33:54,466 --> 00:33:56,246
always be in the user's receipt.

743
00:33:56,796 --> 00:33:58,156
And you can get those back

744
00:33:58,156 --> 00:34:01,126
and should get those

745
00:33:58,156 --> 00:34:01,126
and should get those

746
00:34:01,126 --> 00:34:04,566
We can take a look at

747
00:34:04,566 --> 00:34:07,526
It's a little different

748
00:34:08,085 --> 00:34:11,525
On iOS, the receipt

749
00:34:11,525 --> 00:34:14,096
you're going to want to use

750
00:34:14,876 --> 00:34:17,775
But keep in mind that you're

751
00:34:17,775 --> 00:34:20,025
We have to make a

752
00:34:20,525 --> 00:34:22,176
We have to validate the user.

753
00:34:22,545 --> 00:34:23,856
We've got to know

754
00:34:23,856 --> 00:34:25,045
who have actually

755
00:34:25,045 --> 00:34:27,686
So they're going to have to

756
00:34:27,686 --> 00:34:30,886
or use their thumb print.

757
00:34:31,396 --> 00:34:33,366
And if you're doing anything

758
00:34:33,366 --> 00:34:37,996
like refreshing the receipt

759
00:34:38,166 --> 00:34:40,416
which is really not a

760
00:34:40,686 --> 00:34:41,735
or if you're doing anything

761
00:34:41,735 --> 00:34:43,826
where you're checking

762
00:34:44,156 --> 00:34:47,916
and then fetching it because you

763
00:34:48,056 --> 00:34:50,295
something doesn't look

764
00:34:50,295 --> 00:34:52,616
that you don't get stuck in

765
00:34:52,616 --> 00:34:55,766
If your app crashes and you're

766
00:34:55,766 --> 00:34:56,496
on launch.

767
00:34:56,976 --> 00:34:59,076
Or if you keep checking

768
00:34:59,076 --> 00:35:00,716
and there's something

769
00:34:59,076 --> 00:35:00,716
and there's something

770
00:35:00,716 --> 00:35:04,006
about your validation code, you

771
00:35:04,006 --> 00:35:06,186
that receipt over, and

772
00:35:06,426 --> 00:35:08,416
So that's something

773
00:35:09,556 --> 00:35:13,856
This could be done through

774
00:35:13,856 --> 00:35:16,496
through an SKRecipt

775
00:35:17,096 --> 00:35:18,886
You set your delegate

776
00:35:19,266 --> 00:35:21,766
This will inform your

777
00:35:21,766 --> 00:35:25,116
on the delegate when the receipt

778
00:35:25,116 --> 00:35:28,046
and process the transactions

779
00:35:28,046 --> 00:35:30,236
as if they were purchased

780
00:35:31,336 --> 00:35:35,306
On macOS a little different

781
00:35:35,906 --> 00:35:38,456
you're going to want

782
00:35:38,656 --> 00:35:41,746
this will tell Finder, hey

783
00:35:41,746 --> 00:35:46,996
Again, it's going to require

784
00:35:46,996 --> 00:35:48,576
to have to be signed

785
00:35:48,706 --> 00:35:52,766
And this can just be

786
00:35:53,346 --> 00:35:57,276
And then I just want

787
00:35:57,276 --> 00:35:59,086
with server-to-server

788
00:35:59,086 --> 00:36:01,476
If you're doing an auto

789
00:35:59,086 --> 00:36:01,476
If you're doing an auto

790
00:36:01,476 --> 00:36:03,126
an auto renewing subscription

791
00:36:03,336 --> 00:36:05,516
of if you have content that's

792
00:36:05,516 --> 00:36:09,836
you probably have a hosted

793
00:36:09,836 --> 00:36:11,226
up your in-app purchases.

794
00:36:11,626 --> 00:36:14,936
And so if you're doing

795
00:36:14,936 --> 00:36:18,236
will allow you to validate on

796
00:36:18,236 --> 00:36:20,646
that the user got for their

797
00:36:21,166 --> 00:36:23,796
So again, you take that

798
00:36:23,796 --> 00:36:25,096
and you upload it to the server.

799
00:36:26,296 --> 00:36:30,986
However, I'm going to

800
00:36:31,096 --> 00:36:34,986
don't send the receipt directly

801
00:36:35,476 --> 00:36:39,436
It's not secure and you

802
00:36:40,246 --> 00:36:43,876
One thing to note the verify

803
00:36:43,876 --> 00:36:46,096
payload and that will

804
00:36:46,406 --> 00:36:48,866
like if the receipt you had

805
00:36:49,166 --> 00:36:51,766
you'll get the latest version

806
00:36:51,976 --> 00:36:55,226
And it will include some

807
00:36:55,466 --> 00:36:59,256
or if there was some other

808
00:36:59,326 --> 00:37:02,006
So again, there are

809
00:36:59,326 --> 00:37:02,006
So again, there are

810
00:37:02,296 --> 00:37:05,226
about exactly how the verify

811
00:37:07,736 --> 00:37:11,486
Okay so now we've gotten through

812
00:37:11,736 --> 00:37:13,436
we've processed the transaction.

813
00:37:14,116 --> 00:37:17,306
It's up to you to decide exactly

814
00:37:17,306 --> 00:37:19,446
that receipt and what level

815
00:37:19,446 --> 00:37:21,276
to put behind it and what

816
00:37:21,276 --> 00:37:21,806
to use.

817
00:37:22,176 --> 00:37:24,156
You validated that

818
00:37:24,156 --> 00:37:26,446
That there was a monetary

819
00:37:26,446 --> 00:37:30,106
It's up to you to make what

820
00:37:30,106 --> 00:37:30,506
to them.

821
00:37:30,506 --> 00:37:32,756
Make good on your

822
00:37:32,936 --> 00:37:36,026
And so there's a couple

823
00:37:36,356 --> 00:37:37,846
and we talked about it before.

824
00:37:38,146 --> 00:37:40,046
You might just have

825
00:37:40,046 --> 00:37:41,846
in your app that

826
00:37:42,306 --> 00:37:44,046
A basic version of

827
00:37:44,046 --> 00:37:48,096
A free basic version that now is

828
00:37:48,096 --> 00:37:50,726
to set that state and make

829
00:37:51,366 --> 00:37:54,616
Or if you have content that's

830
00:37:54,876 --> 00:37:56,666
you need to download it.

831
00:37:57,226 --> 00:37:58,636
Whole bunch of different

832
00:37:58,636 --> 00:38:00,156
whole bunch of different

833
00:37:58,636 --> 00:38:00,156
whole bunch of different

834
00:38:00,156 --> 00:38:01,766
I want to highlight

835
00:38:02,556 --> 00:38:05,416
One that's a little newer

836
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:08,626
that Apple provides is

837
00:38:08,996 --> 00:38:11,516
This is a way of

838
00:38:11,756 --> 00:38:15,156
and having the initial

839
00:38:15,156 --> 00:38:16,486
and compact as possible.

840
00:38:16,486 --> 00:38:17,606
Just the binary.

841
00:38:17,606 --> 00:38:20,956
And if you're going to have

842
00:38:20,956 --> 00:38:23,156
with that application, if

843
00:38:23,156 --> 00:38:26,676
of different levels and

844
00:38:26,676 --> 00:38:29,556
or videos associated with

845
00:38:29,556 --> 00:38:33,066
into different components

846
00:38:33,806 --> 00:38:38,916
On-demand resources is hosted in

847
00:38:38,916 --> 00:38:40,086
to worry about hosting.

848
00:38:40,346 --> 00:38:41,846
It's scalable and reliable.

849
00:38:41,846 --> 00:38:44,306
We have caching all

850
00:38:44,676 --> 00:38:46,986
Your users will be able

851
00:38:48,156 --> 00:38:52,756
One thing to keep in mind is

852
00:38:52,756 --> 00:38:53,896
executable code.

853
00:38:53,896 --> 00:38:56,806
So all that code has to be

854
00:38:56,806 --> 00:39:00,056
but it can contain any other

855
00:38:56,806 --> 00:39:00,056
but it can contain any other

856
00:39:00,146 --> 00:39:05,276
And it's also available

857
00:39:05,276 --> 00:39:08,496
macOS doesn't currently

858
00:39:09,106 --> 00:39:11,366
So that's a technology

859
00:39:11,366 --> 00:39:14,666
to fetch additional content

860
00:39:14,666 --> 00:39:16,606
If you're interested in

861
00:39:16,606 --> 00:39:20,736
I highly suggest you check out

862
00:39:21,106 --> 00:39:26,516
It's in Mission, this

863
00:39:27,266 --> 00:39:30,136
Another technology that Apple

864
00:39:30,136 --> 00:39:30,976
purchase content.

865
00:39:30,976 --> 00:39:33,486
This is content that

866
00:39:33,486 --> 00:39:37,336
with your in-app purchase, right

867
00:39:37,886 --> 00:39:39,656
it's hosted on Apple servers.

868
00:39:40,006 --> 00:39:42,326
So you don't have to worry

869
00:39:42,606 --> 00:39:44,016
Scalable and reliable.

870
00:39:44,226 --> 00:39:45,676
Around the world caching.

871
00:39:46,076 --> 00:39:50,496
One thing to keep in mind

872
00:39:50,496 --> 00:39:53,166
is that this will download

873
00:39:53,166 --> 00:39:54,836
Your app doesn't

874
00:39:54,836 --> 00:39:58,846
So the user makes a purchase,

875
00:39:58,846 --> 00:40:01,496
launches another app, and you

876
00:39:58,846 --> 00:40:01,496
launches another app, and you

877
00:40:01,736 --> 00:40:02,636
that will keep running.

878
00:40:04,186 --> 00:40:07,746
You get up to 2 gigabytes per

879
00:40:07,746 --> 00:40:09,206
So that's not 2 gigabytes

880
00:40:09,206 --> 00:40:13,696
for your whole application

881
00:40:13,696 --> 00:40:17,366
And this is supported

882
00:40:17,696 --> 00:40:20,986
So, again another great way

883
00:40:21,316 --> 00:40:23,176
for your in-app purchases.

884
00:40:24,336 --> 00:40:28,576
Let's take a look at what that

885
00:40:28,576 --> 00:40:32,876
A payment came through,

886
00:40:32,876 --> 00:40:34,466
and you're ready to

887
00:40:34,736 --> 00:40:37,446
You're going to be in the

888
00:40:37,446 --> 00:40:38,756
of your payment observer.

889
00:40:38,756 --> 00:40:41,636
And you're going to go down

890
00:40:41,636 --> 00:40:43,616
to look at your transactions and

891
00:40:43,616 --> 00:40:46,876
of those transactions

892
00:40:47,106 --> 00:40:49,776
And all you've got to do is

893
00:40:49,776 --> 00:40:52,746
into the Payment Queue and that

894
00:40:53,206 --> 00:40:56,356
If your application

895
00:40:56,356 --> 00:40:59,386
in using hosted in-app

896
00:40:59,386 --> 00:41:03,666
to have a Payment Queue updated

897
00:40:59,386 --> 00:41:03,666
to have a Payment Queue updated

898
00:41:03,786 --> 00:41:04,886
Payment Queue Observer.

899
00:41:05,396 --> 00:41:10,216
And this will give you all this

900
00:41:10,216 --> 00:41:13,776
as they come in, including

901
00:41:13,776 --> 00:41:15,996
in and let you know

902
00:41:15,996 --> 00:41:17,416
to use this to update UI.

903
00:41:17,416 --> 00:41:19,336
Or time remaining.

904
00:41:19,716 --> 00:41:22,336
Or if an error occurs and

905
00:41:22,806 --> 00:41:24,026
that information will be there.

906
00:41:24,376 --> 00:41:27,986
And then once the download is

907
00:41:28,166 --> 00:41:31,826
again that's a local path URL,

908
00:41:32,106 --> 00:41:33,486
so you can grab it and interact

909
00:41:33,486 --> 00:41:35,006
with your content

910
00:41:35,566 --> 00:41:39,126
So that's how hosted

911
00:41:39,826 --> 00:41:43,716
But you may also want to

912
00:41:44,056 --> 00:41:45,566
perfectly valid thing to do.

913
00:41:45,786 --> 00:41:48,216
If you have a catalog

914
00:41:48,216 --> 00:41:50,836
of if you have different things

915
00:41:50,836 --> 00:41:52,706
to have Apple host,

916
00:41:52,706 --> 00:41:54,016
to do self-hosting content.

917
00:41:54,476 --> 00:41:57,926
One thing to keep in mind is

918
00:41:57,926 --> 00:42:01,116
APIs that you should

919
00:41:57,926 --> 00:42:01,116
APIs that you should

920
00:42:01,216 --> 00:42:02,906
It's the way to host

921
00:42:03,616 --> 00:42:07,236
Content is downloaded even

922
00:42:07,236 --> 00:42:09,386
If you're still using

923
00:42:09,836 --> 00:42:10,776
that's deprecated.

924
00:42:11,066 --> 00:42:13,226
And that's not going to be

925
00:42:13,226 --> 00:42:15,356
for the user as NSURL Session.

926
00:42:15,726 --> 00:42:20,496
So it's very important

927
00:42:21,426 --> 00:42:23,306
This is how it looks in Swift.

928
00:42:23,866 --> 00:42:26,626
You're going to create

929
00:42:27,036 --> 00:42:30,946
This is a configuration you

930
00:42:30,946 --> 00:42:34,076
to your application for what

931
00:42:34,596 --> 00:42:37,026
You're going to create

932
00:42:37,266 --> 00:42:39,496
You're going to pass that

933
00:42:39,496 --> 00:42:43,156
to pass in a delegate, this

934
00:42:43,156 --> 00:42:45,486
to get information back

935
00:42:45,726 --> 00:42:46,936
And you're going

936
00:42:47,256 --> 00:42:49,736
this operation queue is

937
00:42:49,736 --> 00:42:51,216
to call into your delegate.

938
00:42:51,456 --> 00:42:53,516
What thread or what

939
00:42:53,516 --> 00:42:54,746
to call into your delegate.

940
00:42:54,826 --> 00:42:57,706
So you're going to want to make

941
00:42:57,956 --> 00:43:01,436
operation queue for that.

942
00:42:57,956 --> 00:43:01,436
operation queue for that.

943
00:43:01,436 --> 00:43:04,526
And then to kick off the

944
00:43:04,526 --> 00:43:07,286
and you hand in the

945
00:43:07,286 --> 00:43:08,606
with you in-app purchase.

946
00:43:08,976 --> 00:43:09,996
And you call resume.

947
00:43:10,416 --> 00:43:11,236
That will kick off

948
00:43:11,236 --> 00:43:15,296
in the background your

949
00:43:15,296 --> 00:43:16,226
purchase download.

950
00:43:16,926 --> 00:43:19,816
As the download is occurring

951
00:43:19,816 --> 00:43:21,476
to get information,

952
00:43:21,476 --> 00:43:24,796
into URL session didWriteData.

953
00:43:24,896 --> 00:43:27,836
And that will give

954
00:43:28,046 --> 00:43:29,646
you can take this

955
00:43:29,646 --> 00:43:31,166
and it will give you the

956
00:43:31,166 --> 00:43:34,246
You might have a progress bar,

957
00:43:34,246 --> 00:43:39,336
to tell the user about how

958
00:43:39,846 --> 00:43:41,186
But it's also important

959
00:43:41,186 --> 00:43:44,646
that your application

960
00:43:44,646 --> 00:43:46,196
downloading process.

961
00:43:46,326 --> 00:43:48,806
And so when your

962
00:43:49,396 --> 00:43:51,076
you want to actually reattach

963
00:43:51,076 --> 00:43:53,356
to those background

964
00:43:53,826 --> 00:43:56,616
And so in your application

965
00:43:56,616 --> 00:44:00,226
to implement handle events

966
00:43:56,616 --> 00:44:00,226
to implement handle events

967
00:44:00,766 --> 00:44:03,516
This will allow the

968
00:44:03,516 --> 00:44:05,456
up your application and tell it

969
00:44:05,456 --> 00:44:09,436
about hey this background

970
00:44:09,436 --> 00:44:12,176
or is in progress, or

971
00:44:12,606 --> 00:44:15,386
So handle events for

972
00:44:15,556 --> 00:44:18,776
It will pass in the identifier

973
00:44:18,776 --> 00:44:19,766
that you used earlier.

974
00:44:20,276 --> 00:44:21,156
You just recreate

975
00:44:21,156 --> 00:44:23,136
that configuration

976
00:44:23,676 --> 00:44:26,576
Re-create a session

977
00:44:26,576 --> 00:44:28,026
to that background session.

978
00:44:28,026 --> 00:44:31,316
And then what you want to do

979
00:44:31,316 --> 00:44:35,236
that's passed into that app

980
00:44:35,366 --> 00:44:39,626
to need to call that completion

981
00:44:39,626 --> 00:44:41,566
whatever you need to

982
00:44:41,566 --> 00:44:43,896
So if the download's complete

983
00:44:43,896 --> 00:44:46,396
into your container, and

984
00:44:46,796 --> 00:44:49,006
you need to call that completion

985
00:44:49,006 --> 00:44:51,006
everything with it

986
00:44:51,006 --> 00:44:55,586
that you're done doing

987
00:44:55,876 --> 00:44:57,806
So that's making

988
00:44:58,376 --> 00:44:59,776
but you're not quite done yet.

989
00:44:59,776 --> 00:45:01,406
Even though you've

990
00:44:59,776 --> 00:45:01,406
Even though you've

991
00:45:01,406 --> 00:45:02,936
and the user has

992
00:45:03,336 --> 00:45:06,696
you've got to do one more thing

993
00:45:06,926 --> 00:45:08,936
that hey you're done

994
00:45:09,046 --> 00:45:12,856
This is important because

995
00:45:12,856 --> 00:45:15,876
in our purchasing queue, we

996
00:45:16,236 --> 00:45:18,816
and if your application

997
00:45:18,816 --> 00:45:21,546
or if the user leaves and comes

998
00:45:21,546 --> 00:45:22,686
to keep telling you about it.

999
00:45:22,986 --> 00:45:24,646
It actually might

1000
00:45:24,646 --> 00:45:27,526
on your behalf background

1001
00:45:27,526 --> 00:45:29,146
to use up user's data.

1002
00:45:29,396 --> 00:45:31,536
So it's important to keep

1003
00:45:31,536 --> 00:45:33,076
up the transaction

1004
00:45:33,976 --> 00:45:35,806
But you should also

1005
00:45:35,806 --> 00:45:37,926
when the content is

1006
00:45:38,316 --> 00:45:41,546
If you finish the transaction

1007
00:45:41,586 --> 00:45:43,156
we're not going to tell you

1008
00:45:43,156 --> 00:45:44,686
about that transaction

1009
00:45:44,686 --> 00:45:47,726
So if the download fails,

1010
00:45:48,126 --> 00:45:49,536
you're not going to

1011
00:45:49,656 --> 00:45:52,256
So you want to make sure

1012
00:45:52,326 --> 00:45:54,666
and then call finish

1013
00:45:55,516 --> 00:45:57,876
So, again, the payment will stay

1014
00:45:57,876 --> 00:45:59,306
in the queue until

1015
00:45:59,306 --> 00:46:02,496
And if you're downloading hosted

1016
00:45:59,306 --> 00:46:02,496
And if you're downloading hosted

1017
00:46:02,496 --> 00:46:04,796
in mind is yes you need

1018
00:46:05,076 --> 00:46:06,936
and if you finish the

1019
00:46:06,936 --> 00:46:09,196
download's complete we

1020
00:46:09,716 --> 00:46:14,546
And this can be done simply

1021
00:46:14,596 --> 00:46:18,046
Finish Transaction and passing

1022
00:46:18,046 --> 00:46:18,956
into the Payment Queue.

1023
00:46:21,306 --> 00:46:24,976
So, the user has

1024
00:46:24,976 --> 00:46:26,676
they've been buying

1025
00:46:26,676 --> 00:46:29,226
they love your content,

1026
00:46:29,726 --> 00:46:31,096
you know what I'm

1027
00:46:31,096 --> 00:46:33,996
I'm going to delete the app,

1028
00:46:34,316 --> 00:46:36,126
Or they switch to

1029
00:46:36,496 --> 00:46:38,726
It's always important that

1030
00:46:39,876 --> 00:46:45,406
non-consumable and auto-renewing

1031
00:46:45,406 --> 00:46:45,886
into the app.

1032
00:46:45,956 --> 00:46:48,076
They need to be able to

1033
00:46:48,836 --> 00:46:51,306
So restoring transactions

1034
00:46:51,306 --> 00:46:56,056
to restores non-consumable and

1035
00:46:57,116 --> 00:47:00,446
Consumable and non-renewing

1036
00:46:57,116 --> 00:47:00,446
Consumable and non-renewing

1037
00:47:00,606 --> 00:47:02,526
that's up to you to

1038
00:47:02,966 --> 00:47:06,156
So it might be something

1039
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:08,886
it might be something that you

1040
00:47:08,886 --> 00:47:10,936
in your own hosted backend.

1041
00:47:11,236 --> 00:47:13,806
That's up to you guys to

1042
00:47:13,806 --> 00:47:16,696
to restore those, but

1043
00:47:16,696 --> 00:47:20,326
and auto renewing, you can

1044
00:47:20,326 --> 00:47:24,116
restore APIs.

1045
00:47:25,596 --> 00:47:29,236
Again, we offer APIs for

1046
00:47:29,236 --> 00:47:30,566
Completed Transactions.

1047
00:47:30,876 --> 00:47:35,026
That will pull down a brand

1048
00:47:35,446 --> 00:47:37,166
and in-app purchase receipt.

1049
00:47:37,986 --> 00:47:40,286
Again, you're going to

1050
00:47:40,346 --> 00:47:42,006
You added that to

1051
00:47:42,006 --> 00:47:43,566
so of course you're

1052
00:47:43,566 --> 00:47:44,616
You're getting information

1053
00:47:44,616 --> 00:47:46,506
about those transactions

1054
00:47:46,926 --> 00:47:49,766
Because we're going to call

1055
00:47:49,766 --> 00:47:50,916
Transactions Finished.

1056
00:47:50,916 --> 00:47:54,106
That's going to tell you all

1057
00:47:54,306 --> 00:47:55,836
and you're just going

1058
00:47:55,836 --> 00:47:57,926
as if they were just

1059
00:47:58,326 --> 00:48:00,706
Or we're going to give you an

1060
00:47:58,326 --> 00:48:00,706
Or we're going to give you an

1061
00:48:00,706 --> 00:48:03,056
and maybe you need to ask

1062
00:48:03,156 --> 00:48:04,856
or update your UI accordingly.

1063
00:48:05,326 --> 00:48:09,196
So again, it's important

1064
00:48:09,756 --> 00:48:12,366
Again, once the restore is

1065
00:48:12,366 --> 00:48:14,616
at the receipt and

1066
00:48:14,616 --> 00:48:15,676
and features accordingly.

1067
00:48:16,876 --> 00:48:19,906
So now we're going to

1068
00:48:19,906 --> 00:48:22,356
of okay you're built your

1069
00:48:22,356 --> 00:48:24,546
to the App Store you

1070
00:48:24,546 --> 00:48:25,896
that you pass app review.

1071
00:48:26,286 --> 00:48:27,786
A couple things to keep in mind.

1072
00:48:28,976 --> 00:48:30,936
We've just been talking

1073
00:48:31,316 --> 00:48:33,516
You really need to have

1074
00:48:33,516 --> 00:48:35,246
It doesn't have to

1075
00:48:35,246 --> 00:48:38,296
you need to have some mechanism

1076
00:48:38,296 --> 00:48:41,236
to get their content back, or

1077
00:48:41,426 --> 00:48:46,426
Again, for non-consumable and

1078
00:48:46,526 --> 00:48:47,966
you're not going

1079
00:48:47,966 --> 00:48:49,986
of in-app purchases

1080
00:48:51,686 --> 00:48:56,246
One thing to keep in mind though

1081
00:48:56,246 --> 00:48:57,606
from purchases itself.

1082
00:48:57,806 --> 00:48:59,116
Restores are free.

1083
00:48:59,366 --> 00:49:02,746
The user shouldn't get confused

1084
00:48:59,366 --> 00:49:02,746
The user shouldn't get confused

1085
00:49:02,746 --> 00:49:05,126
and they're getting a password

1086
00:49:05,126 --> 00:49:06,606
that it's going to

1087
00:49:06,606 --> 00:49:09,286
This has got to be very

1088
00:49:09,526 --> 00:49:12,636
that this restore operation

1089
00:49:12,636 --> 00:49:14,166
it's completely separate

1090
00:49:14,366 --> 00:49:17,226
So it's one thing you want to

1091
00:49:18,976 --> 00:49:22,506
Some other information

1092
00:49:22,506 --> 00:49:26,126
for auto renewable subscriptions

1093
00:49:26,386 --> 00:49:30,006
keeping the information

1094
00:49:31,356 --> 00:49:34,996
And making sure that once

1095
00:49:34,996 --> 00:49:37,146
that content right then and

1096
00:49:37,196 --> 00:49:40,986
to wait until the next period

1097
00:49:40,986 --> 00:49:43,646
If you subscribe you should get

1098
00:49:44,206 --> 00:49:45,486
And you should get

1099
00:49:45,486 --> 00:49:48,356
that you should only be able

1100
00:49:48,596 --> 00:49:53,616
not bundled products or content

1101
00:49:53,616 --> 00:49:54,706
to get free elsewhere.

1102
00:49:54,706 --> 00:49:57,176
So, these are some of

1103
00:49:57,176 --> 00:49:59,106
I highly recommend

1104
00:49:59,106 --> 00:50:00,966
out the App Review

1105
00:49:59,106 --> 00:50:00,966
out the App Review

1106
00:50:01,586 --> 00:50:04,316
I've heard there's even a

1107
00:50:04,316 --> 00:50:07,196
so I would highly recommend

1108
00:50:07,446 --> 00:50:09,626
because they're changing all the

1109
00:50:09,626 --> 00:50:11,286
up to date with what's

1110
00:50:11,966 --> 00:50:14,526
And with non-renewing

1111
00:50:14,526 --> 00:50:17,596
policies you want to keep

1112
00:50:17,596 --> 00:50:20,226
and making sure that he user

1113
00:50:20,516 --> 00:50:22,546
or opt out accordingly.

1114
00:50:24,326 --> 00:50:26,756
And then finally the

1115
00:50:26,756 --> 00:50:28,196
to pass app review is

1116
00:50:28,196 --> 00:50:31,996
if you have purchases inside

1117
00:50:32,136 --> 00:50:34,446
You make the purchase,

1118
00:50:34,686 --> 00:50:36,506
They should get that

1119
00:50:36,506 --> 00:50:37,966
that content right

1120
00:50:37,966 --> 00:50:40,316
If it's buggy or if

1121
00:50:40,586 --> 00:50:42,166
or if there's something going

1122
00:50:42,166 --> 00:50:47,006
on when the reviewer you

1123
00:50:47,206 --> 00:50:51,066
that app review environment,

1124
00:50:51,066 --> 00:50:52,376
with app review right

1125
00:50:52,376 --> 00:50:53,166
So test it.

1126
00:50:53,486 --> 00:50:55,896
Test it in Sandbox, make

1127
00:50:55,896 --> 00:50:56,756
as you want it to.

1128
00:50:57,436 --> 00:51:02,146
So just to summarize a little

1129
00:50:57,436 --> 00:51:02,146
So just to summarize a little

1130
00:51:03,346 --> 00:51:05,396
Always observe the

1131
00:51:05,396 --> 00:51:06,696
I can't stress this enough.

1132
00:51:06,996 --> 00:51:09,596
If you're interacting with

1133
00:51:09,716 --> 00:51:13,686
one of the first things your app

1134
00:51:13,686 --> 00:51:15,446
observer to get information

1135
00:51:15,446 --> 00:51:18,806
about what's going

1136
00:51:18,936 --> 00:51:21,496
You need to fetch

1137
00:51:21,496 --> 00:51:22,406
from the App Store.

1138
00:51:22,556 --> 00:51:25,046
This is through an

1139
00:51:25,356 --> 00:51:27,906
That will return

1140
00:51:27,906 --> 00:51:31,756
So the information for the

1141
00:51:31,756 --> 00:51:34,566
to billing that's associated

1142
00:51:36,536 --> 00:51:39,276
And again use the

1143
00:51:39,636 --> 00:51:43,656
There's the SKProduct that comes

1144
00:51:43,656 --> 00:51:47,096
with that, you need to use

1145
00:51:47,096 --> 00:51:48,326
and currency information.

1146
00:51:50,476 --> 00:51:52,476
Use the receipt to

1147
00:51:52,476 --> 00:51:55,126
Again, they're your purchases,

1148
00:51:55,306 --> 00:51:57,256
You need to make

1149
00:51:57,256 --> 00:51:59,416
to validate the receipt,

1150
00:51:59,416 --> 00:52:01,196
or on the server.

1151
00:51:59,416 --> 00:52:01,196
or on the server.

1152
00:52:01,196 --> 00:52:03,436
What technologies that back it.

1153
00:52:03,436 --> 00:52:06,726
Be aware exactly what the

1154
00:52:07,026 --> 00:52:08,526
and make your decisions

1155
00:52:09,776 --> 00:52:11,636
And finally make the

1156
00:52:11,756 --> 00:52:15,826
You can just unlock it in your

1157
00:52:16,146 --> 00:52:19,976
or you can make a hosted request

1158
00:52:20,256 --> 00:52:24,346
or you can make a request to

1159
00:52:24,656 --> 00:52:25,926
Make that content available.

1160
00:52:25,926 --> 00:52:28,246
But do it in a reliable

1161
00:52:28,466 --> 00:52:29,686
If you're hosting it yourself,

1162
00:52:29,686 --> 00:52:31,986
make sure your servers

1163
00:52:32,446 --> 00:52:37,316
and you know cache appropriately

1164
00:52:37,316 --> 00:52:39,826
for users making

1165
00:52:41,296 --> 00:52:43,876
And then finally, always

1166
00:52:43,876 --> 00:52:45,746
The last thing you

1167
00:52:45,746 --> 00:52:48,196
that that transaction is no

1168
00:52:48,476 --> 00:52:51,346
or else your observer is going

1169
00:52:51,346 --> 00:52:53,676
about it when your

1170
00:52:53,676 --> 00:52:59,106
And that will incur weird you

1171
00:52:59,106 --> 00:53:01,586
have to authenticate

1172
00:52:59,106 --> 00:53:01,586
have to authenticate

1173
00:53:01,586 --> 00:53:05,936
or there might be backend APIs

1174
00:53:05,936 --> 00:53:08,156
of your app, using

1175
00:53:08,156 --> 00:53:10,046
if you don't finish

1176
00:53:10,656 --> 00:53:12,126
So always do that.

1177
00:53:13,336 --> 00:53:18,976
And then, allow users to

1178
00:53:18,976 --> 00:53:21,346
You need to have a restore

1179
00:53:21,346 --> 00:53:25,126
if you have non-consumable or

1180
00:53:25,336 --> 00:53:26,226
This will allow the user

1181
00:53:26,226 --> 00:53:28,266
to get back what they've

1182
00:53:30,376 --> 00:53:34,616
More information will be online

1183
00:53:34,616 --> 00:53:36,546
I highly recommend you go back

1184
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:39,356
and take a look at

1185
00:53:39,356 --> 00:53:41,716
And then a couple related

1186
00:53:41,716 --> 00:53:43,606
if you're using subscriptions

1187
00:53:43,606 --> 00:53:45,546
you should definitely check

1188
00:53:45,546 --> 00:53:47,446

1189
00:53:47,446 --> 00:53:49,006

Thanks a lot.
