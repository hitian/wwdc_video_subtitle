3
00:00:28,216 --> 00:00:29,676
&gt;&gt; Good morning, everyone.

4
00:00:29,676 --> 00:00:31,016
Thank you for coming.

5
00:00:31,186 --> 00:00:33,096
My name is Megan Gardner.

6
00:00:33,096 --> 00:00:35,496
I am a Software Engineer

7
00:00:35,696 --> 00:00:37,056
and today we're going

8
00:00:37,056 --> 00:00:39,406
about what's new in Game Center.

9
00:00:40,446 --> 00:00:42,826
So if you don't know what

10
00:00:43,216 --> 00:00:45,556
Game Center is Apple's

11
00:00:45,766 --> 00:00:48,466
It allows you, as developers,

12
00:00:48,466 --> 00:00:50,866
which your users can

13
00:00:51,316 --> 00:00:53,876
also define achievements

14
00:00:54,156 --> 00:00:57,636
We also have challenges which

15
00:00:57,636 --> 00:00:59,966
and achievements to add

16
00:00:59,966 --> 00:01:01,046
to your single player games.

17
00:00:59,966 --> 00:01:01,046
to your single player games.

18
00:01:01,586 --> 00:01:04,086
We also have two

19
00:01:04,086 --> 00:01:05,726
both real-time and turn-based.

20
00:01:06,306 --> 00:01:10,196
And we ship all of these

21
00:01:10,196 --> 00:01:12,296
and this year we are

22
00:01:12,826 --> 00:01:13,756
So what's new?

23
00:01:14,506 --> 00:01:15,916
We've got a few new

24
00:01:16,406 --> 00:01:20,956
First is we have a great new way

25
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:23,206
Next we have big news

26
00:01:23,206 --> 00:01:24,496
if you haven't figured

27
00:01:25,206 --> 00:01:29,566
We have a brand new API for

28
00:01:29,566 --> 00:01:31,026
that we're really excited about.

29
00:01:31,406 --> 00:01:33,596
And we're also announcing

30
00:01:34,066 --> 00:01:35,906
Now we don't have time

31
00:01:35,906 --> 00:01:38,036
in this session, but if that's

32
00:01:38,266 --> 00:01:41,306
I really suggest that you

33
00:01:41,306 --> 00:01:44,306
for Apple Watch" later this

34
00:01:45,266 --> 00:01:46,496
So let's talk

35
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:49,456
about message-based

36
00:01:50,016 --> 00:01:52,986
Now you can play with

37
00:01:53,926 --> 00:01:55,576
Currently our multiplayer

38
00:01:55,576 --> 00:01:58,716
for Game Center pretty

39
00:01:58,716 --> 00:02:00,546
This is our

40
00:01:58,716 --> 00:02:00,546
This is our

41
00:02:00,546 --> 00:02:03,056
and this is what most of you are

42
00:02:03,616 --> 00:02:05,406
This is a built-in

43
00:02:05,716 --> 00:02:07,176
It allows your users to be able

44
00:02:07,176 --> 00:02:09,006
to invite their Game

45
00:02:09,006 --> 00:02:10,976
as do play now which

46
00:02:11,246 --> 00:02:14,366
Some of you have

47
00:02:14,366 --> 00:02:16,666
which is our programmatic

48
00:02:16,666 --> 00:02:19,276
to do your own UI and

49
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:22,056
But if you've been using

50
00:02:22,846 --> 00:02:25,116
it now looks like this.

51
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:28,006
This is our new integrated

52
00:02:28,446 --> 00:02:30,296
You'll notice some differences.

53
00:02:30,296 --> 00:02:33,416
There's no bubbles but that's

54
00:02:34,436 --> 00:02:37,496
It now integrates

55
00:02:37,776 --> 00:02:40,866
which will allow your users

56
00:02:40,866 --> 00:02:43,346
to anyone in their

57
00:02:43,346 --> 00:02:44,146
to play a game with them.

58
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:47,146
So let's see what

59
00:02:47,146 --> 00:02:49,736
This is the Multiplayer View

60
00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:50,636
You can click Play Now

61
00:02:50,636 --> 00:02:53,506
and automatch will work

62
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:56,226
However, we're more interested

63
00:02:56,226 --> 00:02:57,356
when we click Invite Friends.

64
00:02:57,356 --> 00:03:01,596
So that will bring in this

65
00:02:57,356 --> 00:03:01,596
So that will bring in this

66
00:03:01,596 --> 00:03:03,936
You can see we have this

67
00:03:03,936 --> 00:03:04,426
that we've got.

68
00:03:04,426 --> 00:03:06,646
We've got the little Doodle

69
00:03:06,986 --> 00:03:09,846
I added a little bit of text

70
00:03:10,136 --> 00:03:13,956
about what this link is

71
00:03:14,146 --> 00:03:16,636
And this is all based on

72
00:03:16,636 --> 00:03:18,256
of your users will

73
00:03:18,256 --> 00:03:21,016
into iCloud for this to work.

74
00:03:21,316 --> 00:03:23,536
You can then start

75
00:03:24,116 --> 00:03:27,326
This will autocomplete to

76
00:03:27,326 --> 00:03:31,366
in a email address or phone

77
00:03:31,366 --> 00:03:33,916
or anyone that you just met.

78
00:03:34,246 --> 00:03:36,416
Or you can click on that

79
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:37,896
to bring in the Contacts.

80
00:03:38,056 --> 00:03:39,436
So these are all my Contacts

81
00:03:39,676 --> 00:03:42,756
that I have Messages

82
00:03:43,346 --> 00:03:45,506
You'll also see that there's

83
00:03:45,506 --> 00:03:48,476
That is where your Game Center

84
00:03:48,476 --> 00:03:51,946
as well as anyone that your

85
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:53,466
on Game Center.

86
00:03:53,686 --> 00:03:56,496
And Nearby also functions the

87
00:03:56,496 --> 00:04:00,056
in that it will be looking

88
00:03:56,496 --> 00:04:00,056
in that it will be looking

89
00:04:00,256 --> 00:04:02,166
that are also playing this game.

90
00:04:02,446 --> 00:04:04,326
So I'm going to click on Alisha,

91
00:04:04,326 --> 00:04:05,826
invite my friend,

92
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:08,976
And then we'll click Add

93
00:04:08,976 --> 00:04:10,446
in into that To field.

94
00:04:12,116 --> 00:04:14,926
You can then, this functions

95
00:04:14,926 --> 00:04:16,156
This is basically Messages UI

96
00:04:16,156 --> 00:04:18,546
so you're users can

97
00:04:18,546 --> 00:04:20,435
and then it's going to

98
00:04:20,435 --> 00:04:23,136
If I clicked on a Game Center

99
00:04:23,136 --> 00:04:25,866
to show up in gray and

100
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:26,756
Center notification.

101
00:04:26,756 --> 00:04:27,636
They're not going

102
00:04:27,636 --> 00:04:30,126
of weird Game Center iMessage.

103
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:33,046
It will come in as

104
00:04:33,256 --> 00:04:37,966
So if we click on that Send

105
00:04:38,026 --> 00:04:39,596
to Alisha and this is

106
00:04:39,596 --> 00:04:40,716
like on Alisha's screen.

107
00:04:41,066 --> 00:04:44,196
She can then tap the link

108
00:04:44,196 --> 00:04:46,826
and that will take her

109
00:04:46,886 --> 00:04:50,036
and start connecting

110
00:04:50,036 --> 00:04:51,546
if she had tapped

111
00:04:52,076 --> 00:04:53,906
And the same functionality

112
00:04:53,906 --> 00:04:56,766
if she did not have Doodle

113
00:04:56,766 --> 00:05:00,016
to the store where she can

114
00:04:56,766 --> 00:05:00,016
to the store where she can

115
00:05:00,016 --> 00:05:01,966
like she would be able

116
00:05:02,286 --> 00:05:05,466
Now I said that there's

117
00:05:05,706 --> 00:05:07,096
in order to implement this.

118
00:05:07,096 --> 00:05:09,666
We have just replaced

119
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:11,696
so if you have been using

120
00:05:12,026 --> 00:05:14,616
then you've got this just

121
00:05:14,616 --> 00:05:17,896
As soon as iOS 10 is shipped

122
00:05:17,896 --> 00:05:20,636
to do this and invite

123
00:05:20,636 --> 00:05:23,176
They will no longer be limited

124
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:25,926
However, we have one thing

125
00:05:25,926 --> 00:05:28,236
if you would like, which

126
00:05:28,236 --> 00:05:30,516
So you'll notice right here it's

127
00:05:30,836 --> 00:05:33,256
If you would like to change

128
00:05:33,386 --> 00:05:36,396
that you feel more appropriately

129
00:05:36,756 --> 00:05:41,196
or more appropriately indicates

130
00:05:41,196 --> 00:05:44,896
or a fun thing that people will

131
00:05:45,036 --> 00:05:47,836
all you need to do

132
00:05:48,006 --> 00:05:49,746
GKMessageInvite to your bundle.

133
00:05:49,746 --> 00:05:52,646
And the same way that we will

134
00:05:52,646 --> 00:05:55,776
to customize your notification

135
00:05:55,776 --> 00:05:58,226
and customize your rich link.

136
00:05:58,596 --> 00:06:00,616
Notice this is the same

137
00:05:58,596 --> 00:06:00,616
Notice this is the same

138
00:06:00,616 --> 00:06:02,836
that is being used for

139
00:06:02,836 --> 00:06:05,556
to taking a wide

140
00:06:05,686 --> 00:06:08,036
So what does this mean

141
00:06:08,606 --> 00:06:10,396
Well, we don't need

142
00:06:10,396 --> 00:06:11,636
because we can play with anyone.

143
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:14,256
So we're freezing

144
00:06:15,646 --> 00:06:17,606
But you will still

145
00:06:17,606 --> 00:06:19,366
of the Game Center

146
00:06:19,366 --> 00:06:21,176
in that Recents Player tab.

147
00:06:21,176 --> 00:06:23,356
And you can still

148
00:06:23,356 --> 00:06:24,266
Friends still exists.

149
00:06:24,266 --> 00:06:25,186
We're not deleting them.

150
00:06:25,186 --> 00:06:25,826
They're still there.

151
00:06:26,206 --> 00:06:29,336
But you won't be able

152
00:06:29,336 --> 00:06:31,536
or respond to any

153
00:06:31,536 --> 00:06:32,416
And because of that,

154
00:06:32,416 --> 00:06:35,376
GKFriendRequestCompose

155
00:06:35,376 --> 00:06:36,706
now deprecated.

156
00:06:37,676 --> 00:06:40,686
It wasn't really used

157
00:06:40,686 --> 00:06:44,516
So what does that mean

158
00:06:44,836 --> 00:06:47,046
Well, if you've downloaded

159
00:06:47,046 --> 00:06:49,406
you might notice some changes.

160
00:06:49,406 --> 00:06:52,416
Well, what is the Game

161
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:54,596
In iOS 9 it was basically used

162
00:06:54,596 --> 00:06:56,536
to manage your account,

163
00:06:57,216 --> 00:06:58,596
You could browse

164
00:06:58,736 --> 00:07:00,156
You could look at

165
00:06:58,736 --> 00:07:00,156
You could look at

166
00:07:00,376 --> 00:07:04,056
check out your achievements,

167
00:07:04,056 --> 00:07:06,436
send challenges, and

168
00:07:07,316 --> 00:07:10,036
Well, it turns out all of these

169
00:07:10,036 --> 00:07:11,266
in other places in the system

170
00:07:11,266 --> 00:07:13,136
and more importantly,

171
00:07:13,686 --> 00:07:19,216
And so we have removed

172
00:07:19,956 --> 00:07:22,926
So where did we do

173
00:07:23,016 --> 00:07:25,016
[ Laughter ]

174
00:07:25,246 --> 00:07:27,246
[ Applause ]

175
00:07:27,476 --> 00:07:29,776
If you want to manage

176
00:07:29,776 --> 00:07:31,296
you can do that in settings.

177
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:32,836
If you want to manage

178
00:07:33,256 --> 00:07:34,656
you can still do

179
00:07:34,786 --> 00:07:37,476
If you want to browse your

180
00:07:37,476 --> 00:07:39,136
you can look at your

181
00:07:39,906 --> 00:07:42,606
You view your leaderboards,

182
00:07:42,606 --> 00:07:44,346
from GKGameCenterViewController.

183
00:07:44,346 --> 00:07:46,536
If you're not using

184
00:07:46,536 --> 00:07:47,656
you can also do your own UI.

185
00:07:48,196 --> 00:07:51,746
If you're not presenting

186
00:07:51,746 --> 00:07:53,846
and achievements in your

187
00:07:53,846 --> 00:07:54,986
that you start doing that now.

188
00:07:55,426 --> 00:07:59,916
And you can also view and take

189
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:02,426
GKTurnBasedMatchmaker

190
00:08:03,206 --> 00:08:07,186
So we've removed the app.

191
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:09,166
Everything is really

192
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:11,176
more importantly, in your app.

193
00:08:11,176 --> 00:08:13,766
We would love our users to

194
00:08:13,766 --> 00:08:14,676
more time in your app.

195
00:08:14,676 --> 00:08:16,336
We've got the rest of the phone.

196
00:08:16,336 --> 00:08:17,646
We don't need any

197
00:08:18,106 --> 00:08:21,956
And so we've removed the app.

198
00:08:22,226 --> 00:08:24,436
Now let's talk about Sessions.

199
00:08:24,436 --> 00:08:27,586
This is our brand new

200
00:08:27,586 --> 00:08:29,276
really excited about this.

201
00:08:29,476 --> 00:08:32,106
This is a brand new

202
00:08:33,556 --> 00:08:36,466
So Game Center Multiplayer,

203
00:08:36,785 --> 00:08:39,166
We basically have

204
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:40,876
with real-time and turn-based.

205
00:08:40,876 --> 00:08:45,576
Real-time will connect

206
00:08:45,576 --> 00:08:49,346
Those connections will require

207
00:08:49,346 --> 00:08:51,156
If anyone drops from

208
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:53,506
then that whole connection

209
00:08:53,876 --> 00:08:55,606
You're just passing

210
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:58,566
And as soon as that match is

211
00:08:59,256 --> 00:09:02,506
Turn-based can connect

212
00:08:59,256 --> 00:09:02,506
Turn-based can connect

213
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:07,206
We have a very formal

214
00:09:07,206 --> 00:09:10,816
and also exchanges but

215
00:09:10,816 --> 00:09:13,736
to follow those rules and you

216
00:09:13,736 --> 00:09:14,996
like fits within that structure.

217
00:09:15,276 --> 00:09:17,356
And all games are stored

218
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:19,386
until they are aged out.

219
00:09:19,866 --> 00:09:21,476
So what is Sessions?

220
00:09:22,156 --> 00:09:24,876
Sessions is our new

221
00:09:25,176 --> 00:09:28,426
So we have this great

222
00:09:28,426 --> 00:09:29,416
and sharing game data.

223
00:09:29,786 --> 00:09:32,796
These are easily shareable

224
00:09:32,796 --> 00:09:34,636
that people can share

225
00:09:34,636 --> 00:09:36,376
that they would like

226
00:09:36,376 --> 00:09:38,186
It's a completely

227
00:09:38,186 --> 00:09:39,666
We don't impose anything on you.

228
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:42,116
You can do whatever you want.

229
00:09:42,116 --> 00:09:45,336
And we have really stable,

230
00:09:45,336 --> 00:09:46,796
that you can set up

231
00:09:47,256 --> 00:09:50,416
And this is going to allow

232
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:52,716
So what does a Session

233
00:09:53,376 --> 00:09:56,046
So we have two main

234
00:09:56,286 --> 00:09:57,266
We've got our game data.

235
00:09:57,266 --> 00:09:58,836
It's probably one of the

236
00:09:59,386 --> 00:10:00,966
But also equally

237
00:09:59,386 --> 00:10:00,966
But also equally

238
00:10:01,046 --> 00:10:05,106
And really this is all that

239
00:10:05,106 --> 00:10:07,286
that you have to have

240
00:10:07,486 --> 00:10:08,746
is a player and some game data.

241
00:10:08,886 --> 00:10:13,136
You can have multiple players

242
00:10:13,246 --> 00:10:14,856
like to play with other people.

243
00:10:14,856 --> 00:10:17,866
We also have the ability to send

244
00:10:17,866 --> 00:10:20,286
These messages will come in

245
00:10:20,636 --> 00:10:23,236
So you can have those messages

246
00:10:23,236 --> 00:10:25,786
between players or multiple

247
00:10:25,786 --> 00:10:28,046
messages all at the same time.

248
00:10:28,746 --> 00:10:31,916
Along with these messages we

249
00:10:32,426 --> 00:10:34,956
So you can send those messages

250
00:10:35,046 --> 00:10:37,066
to let them know that there's

251
00:10:37,066 --> 00:10:38,186
something within that session,

252
00:10:38,186 --> 00:10:39,516
that they might want

253
00:10:40,286 --> 00:10:44,196
Now I only show four players

254
00:10:44,256 --> 00:10:48,516
up to 100 players in a single

255
00:10:48,516 --> 00:10:49,876
than we've been able

256
00:10:50,466 --> 00:10:54,226
And we can have multiple

257
00:10:54,226 --> 00:10:56,596
So you can have small sessions

258
00:10:56,596 --> 00:10:59,556
You can have four players,

259
00:10:59,716 --> 00:11:02,426
Those players can be

260
00:10:59,716 --> 00:11:02,426
Those players can be

261
00:11:02,426 --> 00:11:03,446
onto different teams.

262
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,996
And you can have all

263
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,576
and your player can be in

264
00:11:08,576 --> 00:11:11,286
of sessions all at

265
00:11:11,616 --> 00:11:14,456
We also have real-time streams

266
00:11:14,456 --> 00:11:17,166
and you would like to be able to

267
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:20,346
between your different players,

268
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:21,616
to set their connection states

269
00:11:21,976 --> 00:11:24,656
and we will be setting these

270
00:11:25,026 --> 00:11:26,856
that will allow the

271
00:11:26,946 --> 00:11:30,636
to start communicating

272
00:11:30,636 --> 00:11:34,906
So, let's get into the

273
00:11:35,316 --> 00:11:36,576
of what makes up a session.

274
00:11:37,066 --> 00:11:38,216
So we've got a couple

275
00:11:38,316 --> 00:11:41,696
We've got GKGameSession which

276
00:11:41,806 --> 00:11:43,676
to basically interact

277
00:11:43,676 --> 00:11:45,336
as well as the other players.

278
00:11:45,646 --> 00:11:48,356
We have GKCloudPlayer which

279
00:11:48,646 --> 00:11:50,966
We have GKEventListener

280
00:11:50,966 --> 00:11:53,826
when important things happen

281
00:11:53,826 --> 00:11:54,646
that your players are in.

282
00:11:55,016 --> 00:11:57,386
And we also have

283
00:11:57,386 --> 00:12:00,056
which will give you a little

284
00:11:57,386 --> 00:12:00,056
which will give you a little

285
00:12:00,456 --> 00:12:04,556
that you might encounter

286
00:12:05,106 --> 00:12:07,666
So let's talk about

287
00:12:08,546 --> 00:12:10,476
So this is your main workhorse.

288
00:12:10,476 --> 00:12:12,056
This is where almost

289
00:12:12,056 --> 00:12:13,036
to be done per session.

290
00:12:13,036 --> 00:12:15,106
It allows you to do

291
00:12:15,106 --> 00:12:17,446
You can create a

292
00:12:17,446 --> 00:12:20,886
load and store your game

293
00:12:20,886 --> 00:12:23,666
add your players, remove your

294
00:12:23,696 --> 00:12:26,566
send your notifications,

295
00:12:26,876 --> 00:12:29,286
join your streams, send

296
00:12:29,286 --> 00:12:31,176
Basically everything you're

297
00:12:31,176 --> 00:12:33,046
to be interacting

298
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:37,006
Some more details about that.

299
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:39,506
With your game data

300
00:12:39,506 --> 00:12:41,666
up to 512 kilobytes of data.

301
00:12:42,176 --> 00:12:44,946
This data is going to be

302
00:12:44,946 --> 00:12:47,166
so it's not something

303
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:49,276
And the user is going to

304
00:12:49,276 --> 00:12:51,936
It will count against

305
00:12:52,336 --> 00:12:54,546
And it's going to follow

306
00:12:54,546 --> 00:12:57,506
of who owns that data, how

307
00:12:57,676 --> 00:13:00,506
and what happens when

308
00:12:57,676 --> 00:13:00,506
and what happens when

309
00:13:00,506 --> 00:13:02,046
Messages and Badges,

310
00:13:02,046 --> 00:13:03,646
come in as Game Center

311
00:13:03,646 --> 00:13:04,806
and they're badged as such.

312
00:13:05,186 --> 00:13:08,116
And badging is now going to

313
00:13:08,116 --> 00:13:09,296
by you, as the developer.

314
00:13:10,336 --> 00:13:12,026
We'll get into that a little

315
00:13:12,026 --> 00:13:13,866
to be very clear where that

316
00:13:13,866 --> 00:13:17,036
and you should be able to

317
00:13:17,036 --> 00:13:21,776
and change it to pretty

318
00:13:21,776 --> 00:13:24,456
And we also have these

319
00:13:24,456 --> 00:13:26,906
which basically leverage

320
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:29,566
This is running on the same

321
00:13:29,566 --> 00:13:31,596
as well as iMessage

322
00:13:31,596 --> 00:13:34,396
it's really stable, and it's

323
00:13:34,866 --> 00:13:37,886
So if we want to make a

324
00:13:38,326 --> 00:13:40,826
Well, first we need a title,

325
00:13:40,996 --> 00:13:43,046
something to describe

326
00:13:43,046 --> 00:13:45,416
Either you can define that or

327
00:13:45,856 --> 00:13:49,476
You need your container ID

328
00:13:49,476 --> 00:13:50,876
that you set up with your app.

329
00:13:51,026 --> 00:13:54,916
And also set up a container that

330
00:13:55,136 --> 00:13:57,446
so if you want multiple

331
00:13:57,446 --> 00:13:59,926
that same data, say if

332
00:13:59,926 --> 00:14:02,496
your pay version, or, you

333
00:13:59,926 --> 00:14:02,496
your pay version, or, you

334
00:14:02,496 --> 00:14:04,706
of versions of your

335
00:14:04,706 --> 00:14:06,816
if you set that up correctly,

336
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:09,456
to access that same data.

337
00:14:09,996 --> 00:14:13,206
And you can also set the max

338
00:14:13,376 --> 00:14:16,396
There's a hard limit of

339
00:14:16,396 --> 00:14:19,116
in that real-time stream but

340
00:14:19,116 --> 00:14:21,906
that lower, or something

341
00:14:21,906 --> 00:14:24,426
that when you create

342
00:14:24,426 --> 00:14:25,646
to decide that when you create.

343
00:14:26,696 --> 00:14:31,126
So once you've, so you just will

344
00:14:31,126 --> 00:14:32,536
with all of that

345
00:14:32,536 --> 00:14:34,606
and that will give you a session

346
00:14:34,606 --> 00:14:37,386
that you can start

347
00:14:38,376 --> 00:14:40,996
One of the first things you're

348
00:14:40,996 --> 00:14:42,496
with the session is

349
00:14:42,496 --> 00:14:44,496
to load and save your data.

350
00:14:44,496 --> 00:14:46,886
Any player that's in a

351
00:14:46,986 --> 00:14:49,086
It's just one big blob

352
00:14:49,526 --> 00:14:51,906
And there's a little

353
00:14:51,906 --> 00:14:55,416
with that session that will help

354
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:58,096
which is last modified date

355
00:14:58,096 --> 00:15:01,326
So you'll know who was

356
00:14:58,096 --> 00:15:01,326
So you'll know who was

357
00:15:01,326 --> 00:15:05,086
or not it's important for you

358
00:15:05,086 --> 00:15:05,856
than likely up to date.

359
00:15:06,266 --> 00:15:08,416
So you can just call

360
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:09,606
that will pass you your data.

361
00:15:10,426 --> 00:15:13,506
You'd also probably

362
00:15:13,586 --> 00:15:15,526
As I said before, 512 kilobytes

363
00:15:15,746 --> 00:15:18,936
but you can do whatever

364
00:15:18,936 --> 00:15:23,396
It can be whatever

365
00:15:23,716 --> 00:15:26,786
So you'll call saveData

366
00:15:26,816 --> 00:15:30,246
If there is a conflict, if

367
00:15:30,246 --> 00:15:33,846
in the interim, you will get

368
00:15:33,846 --> 00:15:34,896
that conflicting data back.

369
00:15:34,896 --> 00:15:38,686
And we'll talk a little bit

370
00:15:38,686 --> 00:15:41,606
Anytime someone does save

371
00:15:41,606 --> 00:15:43,186
that goes along with that.

372
00:15:43,186 --> 00:15:45,516
So if you set up your

373
00:15:45,516 --> 00:15:47,666
for a session player to save

374
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:50,276
when someone else has saved

375
00:15:50,276 --> 00:15:52,926
that you will more than

376
00:15:52,926 --> 00:15:55,746
and resolve any conflicts

377
00:15:56,286 --> 00:16:00,316
So as I said, Save

378
00:15:56,286 --> 00:16:00,316
So as I said, Save

379
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:03,276
And this will happen where two

380
00:16:03,276 --> 00:16:06,046
to try to save data in

381
00:16:06,046 --> 00:16:09,916
Since there's no real formal

382
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:12,486
that two players can be

383
00:16:12,486 --> 00:16:16,776
if that's how you design

384
00:16:16,776 --> 00:16:19,136
So say we've got Players Two

385
00:16:19,136 --> 00:16:20,016
to save at the same time.

386
00:16:20,016 --> 00:16:22,136
Well, one of them is

387
00:16:22,136 --> 00:16:22,956
to say it's Player Two.

388
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:27,106
That means when Player Three

389
00:16:27,106 --> 00:16:29,576
to get an error and that

390
00:16:29,576 --> 00:16:30,236
be returned.

391
00:16:30,606 --> 00:16:33,746
Now you are going to

392
00:16:33,746 --> 00:16:35,106
to resolve this conflict.

393
00:16:35,256 --> 00:16:38,106
Since we have no

394
00:16:38,106 --> 00:16:41,416
for what this data is we also

395
00:16:41,536 --> 00:16:43,856
And so it's going to be up

396
00:16:43,856 --> 00:16:46,646
in such a way that it's going

397
00:16:46,646 --> 00:16:49,206
out what those conflicts

398
00:16:49,206 --> 00:16:52,706
and recall saved data in order

399
00:16:52,706 --> 00:16:54,356
for that data to

400
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:58,336
If you do not recall saved data,

401
00:16:58,336 --> 00:17:00,396
and you need to continue

402
00:16:58,336 --> 00:17:00,396
and you need to continue

403
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:02,796
until you return

404
00:17:03,156 --> 00:17:06,906
And then everything

405
00:17:06,906 --> 00:17:10,146
Everything will be the

406
00:17:10,146 --> 00:17:11,856
and you can continue forward.

407
00:17:12,705 --> 00:17:18,356
And then everything

408
00:17:18,836 --> 00:17:21,945
We've talked about

409
00:17:21,945 --> 00:17:25,326
how do you get additional

410
00:17:25,786 --> 00:17:28,936
Any player that's in a session

411
00:17:28,936 --> 00:17:29,336
to join.

412
00:17:29,796 --> 00:17:32,616
Basically you're going

413
00:17:32,616 --> 00:17:34,646
that you need to

414
00:17:34,646 --> 00:17:38,686
You can send this via iMessage,

415
00:17:38,756 --> 00:17:39,946
print it out, paste

416
00:17:39,946 --> 00:17:42,786
that's probably not

417
00:17:42,836 --> 00:17:45,226
But as long as you can get

418
00:17:45,546 --> 00:17:47,666
and they can click on

419
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,336
to be added to that session.

420
00:17:49,686 --> 00:17:53,486
The easiest way to do this

421
00:17:53,706 --> 00:17:55,596
because it just pops

422
00:17:55,596 --> 00:17:57,216
and you can send off a message.

423
00:17:57,456 --> 00:18:00,066
And that's probably the

424
00:17:57,456 --> 00:18:00,066
And that's probably the

425
00:18:00,066 --> 00:18:06,166
So if like the Player One, if

426
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:11,086
from the session, they set up an

427
00:18:11,456 --> 00:18:13,066
to send to Player Two.

428
00:18:13,066 --> 00:18:14,736
They've added a little

429
00:18:14,736 --> 00:18:16,196
want you want to play with me?"

430
00:18:16,196 --> 00:18:18,636
It'll come out as

431
00:18:18,996 --> 00:18:22,216
It will be sent to Player

432
00:18:22,216 --> 00:18:25,456
and as soon as they click

433
00:18:25,456 --> 00:18:28,896
So in order to get the URL

434
00:18:28,896 --> 00:18:29,546
CompletionHandler.

435
00:18:29,546 --> 00:18:30,736
It will give you the URL

436
00:18:30,736 --> 00:18:32,246
that you can then do

437
00:18:32,726 --> 00:18:36,476
And then anytime

438
00:18:36,556 --> 00:18:40,946
to a session the Event Listener

439
00:18:41,276 --> 00:18:42,696
And that will let you know

440
00:18:42,696 --> 00:18:45,466
that someone else has joined

441
00:18:45,546 --> 00:18:48,396
to proceed with your

442
00:18:48,826 --> 00:18:50,446
So we've been talking

443
00:18:50,506 --> 00:18:53,256
so what exactly are they?

444
00:18:53,566 --> 00:18:55,076
Well, we've got GKCloudPlayer.

445
00:18:55,466 --> 00:18:58,206
This is different

446
00:18:58,206 --> 00:18:59,696
that you've been

447
00:18:59,846 --> 00:19:03,746
GKCloudPlayer is only for,

448
00:18:59,846 --> 00:19:03,746
GKCloudPlayer is only for,

449
00:19:04,326 --> 00:19:08,426
It basically has two pieces of

450
00:19:08,466 --> 00:19:11,396
to your app as well

451
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:16,266
that is what the user will have

452
00:19:16,266 --> 00:19:18,176
as what they want they

453
00:19:18,636 --> 00:19:21,496
This is not a GKPlayer

454
00:19:21,716 --> 00:19:24,206
If you try to use this for a

455
00:19:24,206 --> 00:19:27,686
for other multiplayer, for

456
00:19:27,756 --> 00:19:28,846
So please don't do that.

457
00:19:29,146 --> 00:19:31,456
Everyone will be

458
00:19:31,926 --> 00:19:35,706
So how do we get

459
00:19:36,996 --> 00:19:39,356
Basically you can get your

460
00:19:39,516 --> 00:19:42,766
Most of the things in Sessions

461
00:19:42,846 --> 00:19:45,976
from your current player though

462
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:47,246
to make sure that

463
00:19:47,246 --> 00:19:48,216
that you are then saying, "Oh,

464
00:19:48,316 --> 00:19:49,876
this player is saving

465
00:19:50,326 --> 00:19:52,426
All that's handled for

466
00:19:52,636 --> 00:19:55,446
But you might be

467
00:19:55,446 --> 00:19:56,566
like who owns this session?

468
00:19:56,606 --> 00:19:59,606
So you might want to know if

469
00:19:59,846 --> 00:20:00,786
if other player owns it,

470
00:19:59,846 --> 00:20:00,786
if other player owns it,

471
00:20:00,786 --> 00:20:01,976
then that will delete the

472
00:20:02,046 --> 00:20:06,326
And you also might want to

473
00:20:06,356 --> 00:20:10,186
send messages, be a

474
00:20:10,186 --> 00:20:11,916
You can also get any of

475
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:14,876
in the session, it's just

476
00:20:15,096 --> 00:20:18,306
And that's the best way that

477
00:20:18,306 --> 00:20:19,946
to send those messages

478
00:20:20,226 --> 00:20:22,126
especially setting

479
00:20:22,516 --> 00:20:27,886
So speaking of messages and

480
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:31,526
These messages, we say

481
00:20:31,526 --> 00:20:32,826
in as Game Center notifications.

482
00:20:33,386 --> 00:20:35,596
As I said before, all

483
00:20:35,596 --> 00:20:37,146
at any time to any other player.

484
00:20:37,206 --> 00:20:39,146
Those messages are

485
00:20:39,476 --> 00:20:43,136
You can also send a little bit

486
00:20:43,136 --> 00:20:47,676
if there's any sort of relevant

487
00:20:47,676 --> 00:20:50,296
to pass to the other players

488
00:20:50,296 --> 00:20:53,286
or what they might want to

489
00:20:53,766 --> 00:20:58,136
And you can also optionally

490
00:20:58,206 --> 00:21:01,176
so anyone that gets this

491
00:20:58,206 --> 00:21:01,176
so anyone that gets this

492
00:21:01,506 --> 00:21:03,176
as well as that message.

493
00:21:03,366 --> 00:21:05,746
So what does the code look like?

494
00:21:06,176 --> 00:21:08,366
sendMessageWithLocalizedKey.

495
00:21:08,366 --> 00:21:10,826
You've got all these arguments,

496
00:21:10,826 --> 00:21:12,366
or not you would like

497
00:21:12,606 --> 00:21:15,556
And the Event Listener

498
00:21:15,556 --> 00:21:17,646
didReceiveMessage fromPlayer.

499
00:21:17,886 --> 00:21:21,416
And that will be called any

500
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:25,626
in to let the player know

501
00:21:25,626 --> 00:21:27,866
in that they might

502
00:21:27,866 --> 00:21:30,376
or might want to deal with.

503
00:21:31,556 --> 00:21:32,236
And badges.

504
00:21:32,696 --> 00:21:35,656
So I've said badges can be

505
00:21:36,026 --> 00:21:41,316
So basically anytime you send a

506
00:21:41,556 --> 00:21:43,966
that badge state

507
00:21:44,226 --> 00:21:48,586
You've got one badge per

508
00:21:48,586 --> 00:21:51,346
like there's something you need

509
00:21:51,346 --> 00:21:56,456
And these badges can be set

510
00:21:56,456 --> 00:21:59,936
So if you send a message

511
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:02,726
I need some help with this thing

512
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:02,726
I need some help with this thing

513
00:22:02,726 --> 00:22:05,246
and then no one shows

514
00:22:05,246 --> 00:22:07,146
clear those badges and

515
00:22:07,146 --> 00:22:10,146
I didn't want to

516
00:22:10,146 --> 00:22:11,596
And so that you can keep all

517
00:22:11,596 --> 00:22:13,916
of that badge data

518
00:22:14,296 --> 00:22:17,306
The app icon will

519
00:22:17,306 --> 00:22:20,326
so if you've got three sessions

520
00:22:20,326 --> 00:22:22,226
that app icon will say three.

521
00:22:22,636 --> 00:22:24,546
If you have one, you know,

522
00:22:24,546 --> 00:22:26,816
only one of them is

523
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:30,496
We could aggregate that for

524
00:22:30,496 --> 00:22:32,886
what is set in that session

525
00:22:33,106 --> 00:22:34,556
where that badge

526
00:22:35,096 --> 00:22:39,976
So let's talk about

527
00:22:40,546 --> 00:22:42,596
So we've made a session.

528
00:22:42,596 --> 00:22:43,396
We've saved it.

529
00:22:43,396 --> 00:22:44,456
We've loaded it.

530
00:22:44,456 --> 00:22:46,296
We've loaded the data.

531
00:22:46,296 --> 00:22:49,036
We've sent it to some players.

532
00:22:49,036 --> 00:22:52,556
Your user has turned

533
00:22:53,226 --> 00:22:54,726
They've done some other things.

534
00:22:54,726 --> 00:22:55,996
You've come back.

535
00:22:55,996 --> 00:22:58,466
You want to load those

536
00:22:58,466 --> 00:23:00,306
that you've got all

537
00:22:58,466 --> 00:23:00,306
that you've got all

538
00:23:00,306 --> 00:23:01,946
so that they can

539
00:23:02,826 --> 00:23:06,466
So the first thing you'll

540
00:23:06,956 --> 00:23:08,796
loadSessionsInContainer,

541
00:23:08,796 --> 00:23:10,646
that same app container

542
00:23:10,646 --> 00:23:11,816
that you made the session in.

543
00:23:11,866 --> 00:23:15,826
This will load the bare bones

544
00:23:15,826 --> 00:23:18,676
that your local player

545
00:23:18,996 --> 00:23:23,476
Then based off of that data

546
00:23:23,476 --> 00:23:25,706
and figure out which session

547
00:23:25,976 --> 00:23:29,336
That session has two main

548
00:23:29,336 --> 00:23:32,436
One is that title that you gave

549
00:23:32,486 --> 00:23:34,366
You can make it anything

550
00:23:34,886 --> 00:23:39,066
And so that's not enough to be

551
00:23:39,346 --> 00:23:42,896
Upon creation of a session we

552
00:23:43,116 --> 00:23:45,946
and that is what you will

553
00:23:45,946 --> 00:23:46,976
that specific session.

554
00:23:47,316 --> 00:23:49,516
Call loadSessionWithIdentifier

555
00:23:49,836 --> 00:23:51,536
and that will give you

556
00:23:51,536 --> 00:23:53,836
for the session including

557
00:23:53,836 --> 00:23:57,826
to do in order to start loading

558
00:23:57,826 --> 00:24:01,636
to other players, and

559
00:23:57,826 --> 00:24:01,636
to other players, and

560
00:24:01,746 --> 00:24:03,916
You also might want

561
00:24:04,696 --> 00:24:07,176
If you call

562
00:24:07,176 --> 00:24:10,256
that's the same identifier

563
00:24:10,256 --> 00:24:13,446
if the player does

564
00:24:13,446 --> 00:24:15,836
it will merely remove

565
00:24:16,046 --> 00:24:18,266
It will not actually

566
00:24:18,696 --> 00:24:21,406
However, if you're

567
00:24:22,316 --> 00:24:27,436
that that player created,

568
00:24:27,486 --> 00:24:28,586
not only for that player,

569
00:24:28,586 --> 00:24:30,646
but for everyone

570
00:24:30,646 --> 00:24:32,246
And that may be one

571
00:24:32,246 --> 00:24:36,356
that who your local player is,

572
00:24:36,356 --> 00:24:41,186
to be doing that to

573
00:24:41,186 --> 00:24:43,356
alert the user that,

574
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:46,916
for everyone," so that they

575
00:24:47,706 --> 00:24:52,356
At any time a player is removed

576
00:24:52,356 --> 00:24:54,806
called didRemovePlayer

577
00:24:54,806 --> 00:24:57,716
that someone has left

578
00:24:57,716 --> 00:24:59,356
to update your game accordingly.

579
00:24:59,756 --> 00:25:04,116
So let's talk about

580
00:24:59,756 --> 00:25:04,116
So let's talk about

581
00:25:04,116 --> 00:25:06,196
So this is the real-time

582
00:25:06,196 --> 00:25:07,786
Everything else up until

583
00:25:07,786 --> 00:25:09,096
of sound pretty turn-based.

584
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:10,196
You're saving.

585
00:25:10,196 --> 00:25:12,046
You're passing messages.

586
00:25:12,196 --> 00:25:16,326
We also have the ability to have

587
00:25:16,646 --> 00:25:20,216
So Game Session Streams, you are

588
00:25:20,216 --> 00:25:21,946
of the players that are

589
00:25:21,946 --> 00:25:23,656
So everyone who is in that

590
00:25:23,656 --> 00:25:25,566
like to start sending

591
00:25:25,806 --> 00:25:27,046
that is how you're

592
00:25:27,546 --> 00:25:30,676
You can basically see the

593
00:25:30,676 --> 00:25:32,646
that are in the session.

594
00:25:33,236 --> 00:25:35,446
You can send data to

595
00:25:35,446 --> 00:25:37,996
in the connection

596
00:25:37,996 --> 00:25:40,916
And you will be able to add

597
00:25:40,916 --> 00:25:42,506
without having to

598
00:25:42,566 --> 00:25:46,186
So you can someone join in and

599
00:25:46,466 --> 00:25:48,166
third person wants to come

600
00:25:48,206 --> 00:25:49,766
to reset everything up.

601
00:25:49,986 --> 00:25:52,306
As soon as they start

602
00:25:52,306 --> 00:25:53,356
They can start sending data.

603
00:25:53,356 --> 00:25:55,716
You don't have to do any

604
00:25:55,716 --> 00:25:56,936
of that in the background

605
00:25:56,936 --> 00:26:01,136
So how do we set

606
00:25:56,936 --> 00:26:01,136
So how do we set

607
00:26:01,236 --> 00:26:02,756
Basically you just need

608
00:26:02,756 --> 00:26:04,566
to set the connection

609
00:26:05,006 --> 00:26:07,096
So you would just call

610
00:26:07,096 --> 00:26:08,756
with completionHandler.

611
00:26:08,756 --> 00:26:11,846
This can fail for a

612
00:26:11,846 --> 00:26:14,846
of the reasons could

613
00:26:15,236 --> 00:26:16,696
for that session has

614
00:26:16,696 --> 00:26:19,136
So if this is the 17th

615
00:26:19,136 --> 00:26:21,966
that stream and you've

616
00:26:22,446 --> 00:26:27,276
then this will actually fail

617
00:26:27,276 --> 00:26:28,036
to join into the stream.

618
00:26:28,036 --> 00:26:30,996
You can see whether the players

619
00:26:30,996 --> 00:26:33,436
basically the states are

620
00:26:33,436 --> 00:26:35,796
so you can see how many other

621
00:26:35,796 --> 00:26:36,536
and who they are.

622
00:26:36,946 --> 00:26:41,796
And anytime a player either

623
00:26:41,796 --> 00:26:43,186
either connects or disconnects,

624
00:26:43,186 --> 00:26:47,016
the Event Listener session

625
00:26:47,296 --> 00:26:48,266
will be called.

626
00:26:48,696 --> 00:26:53,886
And so you can know whether

627
00:26:53,886 --> 00:26:56,376
and how many people you

628
00:26:56,796 --> 00:26:58,856
Once you set up the connection

629
00:26:58,856 --> 00:27:00,156
to probably start sending data.

630
00:26:58,856 --> 00:27:00,156
to probably start sending data.

631
00:27:01,096 --> 00:27:03,836
So all of the data is

632
00:27:03,836 --> 00:27:04,906
of the connected players.

633
00:27:05,046 --> 00:27:07,286
You can send this either

634
00:27:07,536 --> 00:27:10,946
just the same as our

635
00:27:11,266 --> 00:27:13,996
Whether or not it's more

636
00:27:13,996 --> 00:27:16,646
that those players get that data

637
00:27:16,946 --> 00:27:19,446
that they're getting the

638
00:27:19,756 --> 00:27:24,296
And any time data is

639
00:27:24,296 --> 00:27:28,346
didReceiveDataFromPlayer will be

640
00:27:28,346 --> 00:27:33,946
that data and update your

641
00:27:33,946 --> 00:27:37,206
on with playing your game.

642
00:27:38,056 --> 00:27:42,936
So that's all like the basic

643
00:27:43,486 --> 00:27:45,056
So let's talk about

644
00:27:45,056 --> 00:27:46,696
of what this actually

645
00:27:46,736 --> 00:27:50,326
like when you're

646
00:27:50,526 --> 00:27:52,716
So first basically

647
00:27:52,716 --> 00:27:54,876
your basic turn-based game.

648
00:27:55,136 --> 00:27:56,656
So you've set up your session.

649
00:27:56,656 --> 00:27:57,646
You've got your game data.

650
00:27:57,646 --> 00:27:59,026
You've added a few players.

651
00:27:59,916 --> 00:28:01,346
Maybe it's Player One's turn.

652
00:27:59,916 --> 00:28:01,346
Maybe it's Player One's turn.

653
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:03,776
They're going to start by

654
00:28:03,776 --> 00:28:04,876
and they're going

655
00:28:05,036 --> 00:28:08,566
That data can then be loaded by

656
00:28:08,566 --> 00:28:12,136
Message Player One can then

657
00:28:12,426 --> 00:28:13,686
sending it that badge

658
00:28:13,686 --> 00:28:14,816
"Hey, it's your turn now."

659
00:28:15,056 --> 00:28:16,876
Maybe you would like to do that.

660
00:28:16,946 --> 00:28:19,496
Player Two can load up

661
00:28:19,496 --> 00:28:22,626
figure out what they would

662
00:28:23,106 --> 00:28:25,876
take their turn, save that data,

663
00:28:25,876 --> 00:28:29,146
and then pass the turn

664
00:28:29,846 --> 00:28:31,996
Since there is no specified way

665
00:28:31,996 --> 00:28:33,926
in which these turns can

666
00:28:33,926 --> 00:28:36,726
You can pass it from One

667
00:28:37,066 --> 00:28:39,066
Four to One, whatever you want.

668
00:28:39,066 --> 00:28:41,336
There is no specified way

669
00:28:41,336 --> 00:28:44,516
in which these turns can

670
00:28:44,516 --> 00:28:45,826
we don't know what you're doing.

671
00:28:47,676 --> 00:28:49,946
So you pass the game

672
00:28:49,946 --> 00:28:52,116
They get to take their

673
00:28:52,116 --> 00:28:54,776
So you've got all the

674
00:28:54,776 --> 00:28:56,436
for a really basic

675
00:28:56,556 --> 00:28:59,686
You can also do a

676
00:29:00,156 --> 00:29:02,936
So you've got all of

677
00:29:04,326 --> 00:29:06,496
You can then basically

678
00:29:06,496 --> 00:29:07,606
on their connection states.

679
00:29:07,606 --> 00:29:10,376
As soon as these connection

680
00:29:10,376 --> 00:29:12,516
up the pipes in the

681
00:29:12,516 --> 00:29:13,816
to communicate with each other.

682
00:29:14,276 --> 00:29:15,916
And as soon as all

683
00:29:15,916 --> 00:29:18,766
up then your players can start

684
00:29:19,176 --> 00:29:23,426
And then this data will

685
00:29:23,426 --> 00:29:24,996
as these connections

686
00:29:25,536 --> 00:29:28,236
And then with sessions,

687
00:29:28,236 --> 00:29:30,286
of information you would like

688
00:29:30,506 --> 00:29:33,566
such as, you know,

689
00:29:33,566 --> 00:29:36,316
or anything for this

690
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:38,536
you do have that ability

691
00:29:38,536 --> 00:29:40,756
of a persistent data

692
00:29:40,756 --> 00:29:41,766
to save with that session.

693
00:29:42,946 --> 00:29:46,146
So those are your

694
00:29:46,626 --> 00:29:49,866
But the real power session

695
00:29:49,916 --> 00:29:51,906
to do much more complicated

696
00:29:52,826 --> 00:29:55,466
So say you've got

697
00:29:55,616 --> 00:29:58,356
It's a turn-based game but you

698
00:29:58,356 --> 00:29:59,446
of a complicated turn.

699
00:29:59,446 --> 00:29:59,966
They've got a game.

700
00:30:01,046 --> 00:30:04,306
It's got some trading

701
00:30:04,626 --> 00:30:06,656
so when it's the player's

702
00:30:06,756 --> 00:30:09,946
to trade cards, maybe brick

703
00:30:10,416 --> 00:30:15,746
And so the things that you

704
00:30:15,746 --> 00:30:21,386
with table talk on an actual

705
00:30:21,386 --> 00:30:22,776
easily accomplish with sessions.

706
00:30:23,296 --> 00:30:26,786
So say it's Player One's

707
00:30:26,966 --> 00:30:29,856
with the other players and so

708
00:30:29,856 --> 00:30:32,516
"Hey, I'd like trade

709
00:30:32,926 --> 00:30:33,756
Anyone interested?"

710
00:30:33,966 --> 00:30:35,516
So you can send that message.

711
00:30:35,516 --> 00:30:37,466
You can send a little bit

712
00:30:37,466 --> 00:30:40,126
to let the users know,

713
00:30:40,126 --> 00:30:41,136
and send it out to everyone.

714
00:30:41,206 --> 00:30:42,526
Say Player Four is

715
00:30:42,526 --> 00:30:43,406
That sounds really good.

716
00:30:43,606 --> 00:30:46,566
You know, I'll take that trade,"

717
00:30:46,666 --> 00:30:47,636
that doesn't work for me.

718
00:30:47,636 --> 00:30:48,856
How about wheat for sheep?"

719
00:30:48,856 --> 00:30:49,486
or something else.

720
00:30:50,076 --> 00:30:53,056
So they can send a message back

721
00:30:53,056 --> 00:30:56,726
and saying, "Hey, this is, I

722
00:30:56,726 --> 00:30:57,536
or I have a different trade."

723
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:59,426
You can send that

724
00:30:59,646 --> 00:31:00,856
figure out what you want to do.

725
00:30:59,646 --> 00:31:00,856
figure out what you want to do.

726
00:31:00,856 --> 00:31:02,456
As soon as Player

727
00:31:02,456 --> 00:31:04,256
Well, I'll take that trade,"

728
00:31:04,446 --> 00:31:07,486
they can their turn,

729
00:31:08,236 --> 00:31:10,866
and save their data,

730
00:31:11,196 --> 00:31:15,966
and then pass the

731
00:31:16,216 --> 00:31:21,956
We also have the ability

732
00:31:21,956 --> 00:31:24,456
into multiplayer games

733
00:31:24,456 --> 00:31:26,166
that might be a little

734
00:31:26,366 --> 00:31:29,976
So say you've got a multiplayer

735
00:31:29,976 --> 00:31:31,116
like a King of the

736
00:31:31,116 --> 00:31:33,256
You've got all these people in

737
00:31:33,256 --> 00:31:35,496
of them to be able

738
00:31:35,496 --> 00:31:36,786
So you're going to

739
00:31:36,786 --> 00:31:37,836
You've got Players One and Two.

740
00:31:37,836 --> 00:31:39,086
They're going to turn on

741
00:31:39,376 --> 00:31:41,106
They're going to join into

742
00:31:41,106 --> 00:31:42,256
to pass their data

743
00:31:42,256 --> 00:31:44,166
They're going to have

744
00:31:44,166 --> 00:31:46,956
a little one-on-one, and fight.

745
00:31:46,956 --> 00:31:50,346
And one of those players

746
00:31:50,576 --> 00:31:53,976
In this case let's

747
00:31:54,726 --> 00:31:58,286
And then Player Two

748
00:31:58,286 --> 00:32:00,276
with the next person in line.

749
00:31:58,286 --> 00:32:00,276
with the next person in line.

750
00:32:00,276 --> 00:32:02,436
You don't have to stop

751
00:32:02,436 --> 00:32:04,586
You don't have to set up any

752
00:32:04,966 --> 00:32:08,566
As soon as Player Three sets

753
00:32:08,566 --> 00:32:11,046
can start sending that data

754
00:32:11,046 --> 00:32:14,366
and Three immediately

755
00:32:14,466 --> 00:32:16,886
to have their little

756
00:32:17,316 --> 00:32:22,306
This time [inaudible] and

757
00:32:22,306 --> 00:32:23,386
in and join in the fray.

758
00:32:23,666 --> 00:32:26,466
They can make that

759
00:32:26,466 --> 00:32:28,066
And you can continue

760
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:31,396
continuing to do any

761
00:32:31,396 --> 00:32:32,546
If you've got like 100 players,

762
00:32:32,546 --> 00:32:34,016
you can go through

763
00:32:34,366 --> 00:32:36,496
And just continue to

764
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:38,166
of the Hill style fight.

765
00:32:38,286 --> 00:32:40,566
And then you can store

766
00:32:40,956 --> 00:32:45,366
that will allow to have a little

767
00:32:45,366 --> 00:32:48,346
and a little bit more persistent

768
00:32:48,346 --> 00:32:49,326
that are in this session.

769
00:32:50,886 --> 00:32:53,036
Another situation

770
00:32:53,036 --> 00:32:55,586
into is assisted single player.

771
00:32:55,806 --> 00:32:58,686
So say you've got a

772
00:32:58,686 --> 00:33:00,706
You're using Sessions to

773
00:32:58,686 --> 00:33:00,706
You're using Sessions to

774
00:33:01,096 --> 00:33:02,246
which is totally fine.

775
00:33:02,246 --> 00:33:04,676
You can absolutely do a single

776
00:33:04,956 --> 00:33:08,406
and basically use this as

777
00:33:08,626 --> 00:33:12,476
and send your data so that all

778
00:33:12,476 --> 00:33:14,776
across all of your

779
00:33:16,356 --> 00:33:18,416
But say your player is having

780
00:33:18,416 --> 00:33:20,566
They've been playing this

781
00:33:20,566 --> 00:33:22,286
Then they can't get

782
00:33:22,286 --> 00:33:23,556
They're having a

783
00:33:24,136 --> 00:33:26,146
Well, if you implement

784
00:33:26,276 --> 00:33:30,316
then Player One can then share

785
00:33:30,736 --> 00:33:32,446
And so they can bring

786
00:33:32,716 --> 00:33:34,286
And then you can

787
00:33:34,286 --> 00:33:36,966
that will allow Player

788
00:33:36,966 --> 00:33:39,266
through that level,

789
00:33:39,266 --> 00:33:41,626
or you could even just allow

790
00:33:41,626 --> 00:33:44,696
that level for Player One

791
00:33:44,696 --> 00:33:47,606
that really sticky point in

792
00:33:47,606 --> 00:33:48,906
to have a little

793
00:33:49,116 --> 00:33:51,066
So Player Two can come in, say,

794
00:33:51,636 --> 00:33:53,606
do whatever you would

795
00:33:53,606 --> 00:33:54,896
Save that data, so

796
00:33:54,896 --> 00:33:58,236
And then they can lead

797
00:33:58,236 --> 00:34:00,656
from that game and Player

798
00:33:58,236 --> 00:34:00,656
from that game and Player

799
00:34:00,656 --> 00:34:04,036
that game just as if Player

800
00:34:04,036 --> 00:34:05,086
been there.

801
00:34:05,086 --> 00:34:08,556
So that is Game Sessions.

802
00:34:09,056 --> 00:34:11,466
This is going to allow you

803
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:13,656
with anyone, anyone that has

804
00:34:13,656 --> 00:34:14,045
play with.

805
00:34:14,096 --> 00:34:16,775
You don't need to be their

806
00:34:17,096 --> 00:34:21,176
So much more flexible game

807
00:34:21,176 --> 00:34:24,446
to allow you, as developers,

808
00:34:24,446 --> 00:34:25,795
in whatever manner

809
00:34:25,795 --> 00:34:29,846
We have really, really simple

810
00:34:29,846 --> 00:34:32,416
They are really easy to

811
00:34:32,416 --> 00:34:34,926
They allow for lots of data

812
00:34:35,446 --> 00:34:36,966
And we're really excited

813
00:34:36,966 --> 00:34:39,436
to see what new possible game

814
00:34:39,436 --> 00:34:42,116
up with because of

815
00:34:42,116 --> 00:34:44,536
Because of this mixing

816
00:34:44,806 --> 00:34:49,096
and real-time elements for

817
00:34:49,136 --> 00:34:51,716
to see what you're

818
00:34:52,396 --> 00:34:55,446
So that's what's new in

819
00:34:55,735 --> 00:34:58,396
We had our new message-based

820
00:34:58,456 --> 00:34:59,816
which are now going

821
00:34:59,816 --> 00:35:01,306
with anyone that

822
00:34:59,816 --> 00:35:01,306
with anyone that

823
00:35:01,886 --> 00:35:04,616
We have removed the

824
00:35:04,806 --> 00:35:06,766
We have those persistent

825
00:35:07,216 --> 00:35:08,466
that we just talked about.

826
00:35:08,756 --> 00:35:11,366
And we have also announced

827
00:35:11,716 --> 00:35:14,166

829
00:35:15,556 --> 00:35:17,706
We are session number 611.

830
00:35:18,006 --> 00:35:20,316
And we have a few

831
00:35:20,316 --> 00:35:21,886
that you might be interested in.

832
00:35:22,176 --> 00:35:23,316
We have the "Game Technologies

833
00:35:23,316 --> 00:35:25,406
for Apple Watch" later

834
00:35:25,716 --> 00:35:29,296
We've also had several

835
00:35:29,296 --> 00:35:33,356
that you can go and watch the

836
00:35:33,356 --> 00:35:35,406
even more than what's

837
