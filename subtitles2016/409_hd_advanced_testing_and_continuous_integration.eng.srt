3
00:00:36,546 --> 00:00:37,556
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon, everyone.

4
00:00:39,026 --> 00:00:39,946
My name is Zoltan.

5
00:00:40,686 --> 00:00:42,996
Later my colleague, Eric,

6
00:00:44,486 --> 00:00:47,986
We're both engineers

7
00:00:49,596 --> 00:00:52,066
Software development

8
00:00:52,066 --> 00:00:53,316
like conducting an orchestra.

9
00:00:54,546 --> 00:00:58,726
You and I maintain suites

10
00:00:58,726 --> 00:01:00,446
of them is not performing well,

11
00:00:58,726 --> 00:01:00,446
of them is not performing well,

12
00:01:01,086 --> 00:01:05,166
we need to quickly understand

13
00:01:05,766 --> 00:01:10,626
Okay. Maybe you're a

14
00:01:10,626 --> 00:01:13,456
of thousands of tests.

15
00:01:13,606 --> 00:01:16,906
Well, Xcode has tools

16
00:01:17,016 --> 00:01:19,586
to conduct even the

17
00:01:20,606 --> 00:01:24,016
and today we're going

18
00:01:24,966 --> 00:01:26,786
First, we're going to

19
00:01:26,786 --> 00:01:30,786
that haven't been addressed in

20
00:01:32,146 --> 00:01:34,566
we'll introduce some

21
00:01:35,216 --> 00:01:41,586
in Xcode Server, in particular,

22
00:01:41,906 --> 00:01:43,506
the configurable

23
00:01:44,116 --> 00:01:48,246
And then, we'll conclude with

24
00:01:48,986 --> 00:01:49,956
Let's get started.

25
00:01:58,216 --> 00:02:01,286
So, as a brief recap of testing,

26
00:01:58,216 --> 00:02:01,286
So, as a brief recap of testing,

27
00:02:01,286 --> 00:02:02,746
as these four characters.

28
00:02:04,026 --> 00:02:05,546
There's XC test.

29
00:02:07,496 --> 00:02:09,946
That's the framework

30
00:02:11,376 --> 00:02:13,856
for both Objective-C

31
00:02:14,946 --> 00:02:18,936
And your tests are compiled

32
00:02:21,436 --> 00:02:25,426
Xcode, that's the IDE

33
00:02:26,076 --> 00:02:30,016
and you can also run individual

34
00:02:33,056 --> 00:02:36,016
Xcode is also where

35
00:02:36,216 --> 00:02:39,276
from both local test runs

36
00:02:41,126 --> 00:02:42,816
And talking about Xcode Server,

37
00:02:43,876 --> 00:02:46,366
that's the continuous

38
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:47,256
for your tests.

39
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:51,336
You set up bots to

40
00:02:52,126 --> 00:02:55,136
and Xcode Server will

41
00:02:55,956 --> 00:02:59,046
And if something goes

42
00:02:59,966 --> 00:03:02,776
There's a great way to keep

43
00:02:59,966 --> 00:03:02,776
There's a great way to keep

44
00:03:06,316 --> 00:03:09,186
So, Xcode Server is built

45
00:03:10,646 --> 00:03:13,846
and you can use xcodebuild

46
00:03:14,246 --> 00:03:17,896
You can run tests and see

47
00:03:21,376 --> 00:03:25,366
Xcodebuild is the

48
00:03:25,366 --> 00:03:27,666
continuous integration

49
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:32,166
So, you can learn more

50
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:33,406
in our previous sessions.

51
00:03:34,226 --> 00:03:37,416
But, today, we want to

52
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:38,796
that we haven't covered before.

53
00:03:39,476 --> 00:03:41,476
We want to take you

54
00:03:41,906 --> 00:03:44,466
and show you exactly how

55
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:49,426
And to do that, it helps

56
00:03:50,066 --> 00:03:55,186
After your tests are

57
00:03:56,206 --> 00:03:59,196
That gets the test

58
00:04:00,556 --> 00:04:02,006
And then, once the

59
00:04:02,586 --> 00:04:04,606
you can see detailed progress

60
00:04:05,086 --> 00:04:08,506
in your tests using a

61
00:04:08,936 --> 00:04:10,786
So, we're going to look

62
00:04:10,786 --> 00:04:12,056
hosting and observation.

63
00:04:13,346 --> 00:04:14,656
Let's look at hosting first.

64
00:04:16,096 --> 00:04:18,636
So, the hosting story,

65
00:04:18,636 --> 00:04:21,946
on whether you have

66
00:04:23,476 --> 00:04:28,066
So, for unit tests, your test

67
00:04:28,066 --> 00:04:29,196
into your application.

68
00:04:29,856 --> 00:04:33,126
And, in this case, we

69
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:34,176
host application.

70
00:04:35,996 --> 00:04:40,396
But for your UI tests, your test

71
00:04:40,396 --> 00:04:44,946
into a UI test runner which is

72
00:04:46,156 --> 00:04:48,656
And in this case, we

73
00:04:48,656 --> 00:04:50,086
as the target application.

74
00:04:50,816 --> 00:04:53,116
Now, this has some implications.

75
00:04:56,356 --> 00:04:59,606
For your unit tests, you

76
00:04:59,606 --> 00:05:03,826
to your applications

77
00:04:59,606 --> 00:05:03,826
to your applications

78
00:05:04,076 --> 00:05:07,846
but for your UI tests, you have

79
00:05:07,906 --> 00:05:12,196
to access your application using

80
00:05:12,406 --> 00:05:15,906
and see your application as a

81
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:23,156
For your unit tests, all

82
00:05:23,896 --> 00:05:26,246
in the same launch of

83
00:05:26,736 --> 00:05:28,656
So, you should be

84
00:05:28,656 --> 00:05:30,956
up between test invocations.

85
00:05:31,366 --> 00:05:36,746
But for your UI tests,

86
00:05:36,746 --> 00:05:38,296
and relaunch the application.

87
00:05:38,806 --> 00:05:39,816
So, that's great if you want

88
00:05:39,816 --> 00:05:43,326
to test how your

89
00:05:45,726 --> 00:05:47,006
Okay. That's hosting.

90
00:05:47,616 --> 00:05:49,846
That's how your test gets

91
00:05:50,386 --> 00:05:53,136
and once your tests are running,

92
00:05:53,846 --> 00:05:56,046
then you can use a

93
00:05:56,046 --> 00:05:58,716
to see detailed progress

94
00:05:59,796 --> 00:06:01,796
So, let's zoom in

95
00:05:59,796 --> 00:06:01,796
So, let's zoom in

96
00:06:04,196 --> 00:06:07,846
Here you can see two test cases,

97
00:06:08,336 --> 00:06:11,196
And these test cases

98
00:06:12,596 --> 00:06:15,756
Test suite corresponds to a

99
00:06:17,196 --> 00:06:20,116
And you'll have multiple test

100
00:06:22,306 --> 00:06:23,616
And maybe you're interested

101
00:06:23,616 --> 00:06:26,686
in doing some setup work

102
00:06:27,406 --> 00:06:29,256
Or perhaps doing

103
00:06:29,626 --> 00:06:31,106
after all the tests

104
00:06:31,796 --> 00:06:33,436
Or maybe you're interested

105
00:06:33,436 --> 00:06:35,916
in doing some custom

106
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:42,256
Well, you can do that with the

107
00:06:43,186 --> 00:06:45,696
You write an object that

108
00:06:46,096 --> 00:06:49,216
and after registering it with

109
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:52,346
your object will

110
00:06:53,806 --> 00:06:56,566
So, for instance, before

111
00:06:56,776 --> 00:07:00,266
you'll get this BundleWillStart

112
00:06:56,776 --> 00:07:00,266
you'll get this BundleWillStart

113
00:07:00,346 --> 00:07:03,286
And then, before

114
00:07:03,676 --> 00:07:07,386
you'll get a SuiteWillStart

115
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:10,986
Then, for every test

116
00:07:11,616 --> 00:07:16,176
you'll get this

117
00:07:16,176 --> 00:07:19,866
and testCaseDidFinish call back.

118
00:07:21,556 --> 00:07:22,896
If something goes awry,

119
00:07:23,506 --> 00:07:26,966
you'll get this testCaseDidFail

120
00:07:27,866 --> 00:07:30,346
And then, as the

121
00:07:31,156 --> 00:07:33,276
you'll get this

122
00:07:34,096 --> 00:07:36,366
and your final chance

123
00:07:36,366 --> 00:07:40,466
in this testBundleWillFinish

124
00:07:43,576 --> 00:07:45,036
So, here's an example.

125
00:07:46,346 --> 00:07:49,006
This object conforms to

126
00:07:49,826 --> 00:07:52,376
In the object initializer,

127
00:07:52,376 --> 00:07:54,046
with a shared observation

128
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:57,546
Then, as the tests progress,

129
00:07:57,896 --> 00:08:00,356
I'm going to log

130
00:07:57,896 --> 00:08:00,356
I'm going to log

131
00:08:01,976 --> 00:08:08,176
When things go wrong with the

132
00:08:08,396 --> 00:08:13,456
And then, once the show is

133
00:08:13,696 --> 00:08:17,026
So, an ideal place to

134
00:08:17,026 --> 00:08:19,596
in your test bundles info.plist.

135
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:23,906
So, you do that using

136
00:08:24,496 --> 00:08:27,486
You add this NS principal

137
00:08:28,066 --> 00:08:34,596
and this is a test specific

138
00:08:35,846 --> 00:08:38,635
It's independent of the

139
00:08:42,496 --> 00:08:45,256
Okay. That's hosting

140
00:08:45,796 --> 00:08:48,696
They're useful concepts to help

141
00:08:48,696 --> 00:08:50,316
tests are running

142
00:08:50,316 --> 00:08:55,436
and to help you diagnose

143
00:08:55,676 --> 00:08:57,286
Let's look at some new

144
00:08:59,976 --> 00:09:03,126
Crashes are a frequent

145
00:08:59,976 --> 00:09:03,126
Crashes are a frequent

146
00:09:04,036 --> 00:09:07,826
and the crashes can be in

147
00:09:08,146 --> 00:09:09,726
and the target application.

148
00:09:11,546 --> 00:09:15,566
So, normally, Xcode will

149
00:09:15,566 --> 00:09:16,896
to complete your test suite.

150
00:09:17,676 --> 00:09:21,996
But it's up to you to gather

151
00:09:21,996 --> 00:09:25,456
to resolve the crash.

152
00:09:25,636 --> 00:09:29,566
I'm please to say that

153
00:09:29,566 --> 00:09:30,986
to help with this issue.

154
00:09:31,526 --> 00:09:34,766
We will now gather the crash

155
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:41,456
So, this is both for UI

156
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:44,486
and server runs of your tests.

157
00:09:44,486 --> 00:09:47,896
The crash logs will be

158
00:09:48,426 --> 00:09:50,866
And you can see the

159
00:09:50,866 --> 00:09:55,666
of the crash there, or you

160
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:57,306
in the context of your source.

161
00:09:57,366 --> 00:09:59,766
And I'd like to show

162
00:10:02,316 --> 00:10:03,606
Eric and I have been

163
00:10:04,606 --> 00:10:07,736
We've been working on a tvOS

164
00:10:08,226 --> 00:10:09,446
So, I'll run the application

165
00:10:09,446 --> 00:10:10,976
by control clicking

166
00:10:18,176 --> 00:10:21,226
It's an application

167
00:10:21,226 --> 00:10:24,116
with some strangely

168
00:10:25,056 --> 00:10:27,596
I can move in the

169
00:10:27,596 --> 00:10:30,376
on the keyboard here.

170
00:10:31,766 --> 00:10:34,086
So, we're adding a new

171
00:10:34,536 --> 00:10:37,506
to support users who have

172
00:10:37,926 --> 00:10:40,876
Let me show you what it's

173
00:10:45,046 --> 00:10:51,556
I'll go to the settings

174
00:10:52,516 --> 00:10:53,976
I'll disable location services.

175
00:11:00,046 --> 00:11:05,436
So, now, back in Xcode, we've

176
00:11:05,436 --> 00:11:06,846
to support those users.

177
00:11:07,566 --> 00:11:08,966
They can enter in a zip code.

178
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:14,676
Let me just add one more

179
00:11:21,346 --> 00:11:24,316
So, I want these tests to

180
00:11:26,246 --> 00:11:28,256
So, I'm going to go

181
00:11:28,756 --> 00:11:30,926
and I'll duplicate

182
00:11:36,336 --> 00:11:37,576
I'll call this something

183
00:11:42,236 --> 00:11:44,686
And, in the settings

184
00:11:45,256 --> 00:11:47,236
I'm going to disable

185
00:11:48,136 --> 00:11:51,126
So, that's a technique to

186
00:11:52,186 --> 00:11:55,126
It allows all the tests

187
00:11:55,126 --> 00:11:57,476
without breaking

188
00:11:58,066 --> 00:12:00,736
And it's similar to how your

189
00:11:58,066 --> 00:12:00,736
And it's similar to how your

190
00:12:00,736 --> 00:12:05,206
So, I'll disable tests

191
00:12:05,206 --> 00:12:06,446
to location services.

192
00:12:08,896 --> 00:12:10,266
I'll share the scheme.

193
00:12:14,096 --> 00:12:15,976
And then, I'll run the

194
00:12:33,056 --> 00:12:35,446
So, here's a new

195
00:12:35,446 --> 00:12:37,266
who have location

196
00:12:38,306 --> 00:12:42,166
They can choose to

197
00:12:42,376 --> 00:12:44,816
So, right now, the tests

198
00:12:52,076 --> 00:12:55,136
and that's an unexpected crash.

199
00:12:56,126 --> 00:12:59,256
So, right now, Xcode has

200
00:12:59,526 --> 00:13:01,516
and it's reported

201
00:12:59,526 --> 00:13:01,516
and it's reported

202
00:13:01,516 --> 00:13:05,026
And, let's have a look at that.

203
00:13:05,026 --> 00:13:08,166
So, here's the failed

204
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:10,596
to jump to the test report.

205
00:13:12,276 --> 00:13:14,706
I'll disclose the

206
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:19,296
Here's the events as the tests

207
00:13:19,906 --> 00:13:22,096
and here at the bottom

208
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:26,866
Now, I can click to see

209
00:13:26,866 --> 00:13:30,026
of this crash, but in this case,

210
00:13:30,026 --> 00:13:31,716
in the context of the source.

211
00:13:32,206 --> 00:13:33,726
So, I'll click on

212
00:13:35,176 --> 00:13:39,596
So, here's the exact line

213
00:13:39,686 --> 00:13:43,166
And you can see in the

214
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:44,436
in the debug navigator.

215
00:13:47,016 --> 00:13:51,286
Now, I can see the crash

216
00:13:51,286 --> 00:13:52,396
and diagnose the issue.

217
00:13:53,796 --> 00:13:55,336
So, I happen to know

218
00:13:55,336 --> 00:13:56,886
to the wrong ViewController

219
00:13:57,356 --> 00:14:00,496
Instead of parent, this should

220
00:13:57,356 --> 00:14:00,496
Instead of parent, this should

221
00:14:01,936 --> 00:14:05,916
So, I'll make that change,

222
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:09,976
by going to the test navigator

223
00:14:16,396 --> 00:14:18,626
So, earlier, I showed

224
00:14:18,626 --> 00:14:22,916
for a local test run, but that

225
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:24,496
same if it came from

226
00:14:28,586 --> 00:14:29,976
So, now the tests are

227
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:43,296
Great. So, these

228
00:14:43,496 --> 00:14:47,986
We would now check in this

229
00:14:47,986 --> 00:14:51,166
that we're supporting users who

230
00:14:52,316 --> 00:14:54,296
But, for now, let's

231
00:14:56,616 --> 00:15:01,676
So, you've seen how Xcode will

232
00:14:56,616 --> 00:15:01,676
So, you've seen how Xcode will

233
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:03,966
and capture them

234
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:07,576
And you can choose to see

235
00:15:07,576 --> 00:15:12,856
of those crashes, or

236
00:15:12,856 --> 00:15:14,556
in the context of your source.

237
00:15:15,076 --> 00:15:17,606
So, that's a great way

238
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:23,966
and to make the fix right in

239
00:15:24,206 --> 00:15:26,466
So, we have some new

240
00:15:27,546 --> 00:15:30,396
and to show you more,

241
00:15:30,786 --> 00:15:31,956
Eric Dudiak, on stage.

242
00:15:32,516 --> 00:15:37,036
[ Applause ]

243
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:38,206
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon.

244
00:15:38,246 --> 00:15:40,556
I'm Eric Dudiak, and I'm

245
00:15:40,556 --> 00:15:44,626
about Xcode Server and what

246
00:15:45,246 --> 00:15:46,826
So, let's go over a

247
00:15:46,826 --> 00:15:48,126
of what we're going

248
00:15:48,576 --> 00:15:50,136
in Xcode 8 with Xcode Server.

249
00:15:50,966 --> 00:15:52,646
So, we have custom

250
00:15:52,646 --> 00:15:54,306
that you can now

251
00:15:55,706 --> 00:15:57,716
We have advanced

252
00:15:57,716 --> 00:16:01,726
that we've improved in Xcode 8.

253
00:15:57,716 --> 00:16:01,726
that we've improved in Xcode 8.

254
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:06,066
We also have some enhancements

255
00:16:06,066 --> 00:16:07,796
to make sure you get

256
00:16:07,796 --> 00:16:09,746
as they come up on your bot.

257
00:16:10,426 --> 00:16:13,416
And we'll see how that plays

258
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:14,646
a new feature we have for you.

259
00:16:14,646 --> 00:16:16,806
And finally, we'll talk

260
00:16:16,806 --> 00:16:18,636
about the configurable

261
00:16:18,736 --> 00:16:20,066
which is new in Xcode

262
00:16:20,066 --> 00:16:22,856
So, let's jump right

263
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:24,196
about custom environment

264
00:16:24,656 --> 00:16:25,826
Now, this is a little

265
00:16:25,826 --> 00:16:29,076
It's actually new in Xcode

266
00:16:29,076 --> 00:16:31,456
to configure the exact

267
00:16:31,456 --> 00:16:32,746
to xcodebuild on your bot.

268
00:16:33,046 --> 00:16:34,966
And it controls how your

269
00:16:34,966 --> 00:16:37,446
so you can configure any number

270
00:16:37,446 --> 00:16:39,746
for your bot to run on

271
00:16:39,746 --> 00:16:40,656
than you might have locally.

272
00:16:41,966 --> 00:16:44,136
This is a great way to customize

273
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:46,426
integrations, and it's a great

274
00:16:46,426 --> 00:16:50,056
to create a lot of extra

275
00:16:50,686 --> 00:16:52,286
Now, on to what's

276
00:16:53,226 --> 00:16:56,186
So, we've significantly improved

277
00:16:56,316 --> 00:16:59,366
So, we have two types of

278
00:16:59,956 --> 00:17:01,726
First, let's talk a little

279
00:16:59,956 --> 00:17:01,726
First, let's talk a little

280
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:03,506
These run either

281
00:17:03,906 --> 00:17:06,366
or after your integration, and

282
00:17:06,915 --> 00:17:09,326
So, we've improved the editor

283
00:17:09,376 --> 00:17:12,486
to see the scripts, and you

284
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:15,126
in them, so you have a lot

285
00:17:16,056 --> 00:17:18,866
Along those lines, we also

286
00:17:18,866 --> 00:17:20,056
This is great if

287
00:17:20,056 --> 00:17:23,806
Your other teammates can see

288
00:17:23,806 --> 00:17:26,556
supposed to be doing, and if you

289
00:17:26,556 --> 00:17:28,586
scripts that are part of

290
00:17:29,086 --> 00:17:31,246
you will see that

291
00:17:31,246 --> 00:17:32,176
as Xcode's integrating.

292
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:34,236
So, when you see a project

293
00:17:34,236 --> 00:17:36,266
you can actually see which

294
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:39,976
Finally, if you have a script

295
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:42,276
that you actually really wish

296
00:17:42,276 --> 00:17:46,136
other scripts, you can now

297
00:17:46,386 --> 00:17:49,606
Simply add a new script

298
00:17:49,606 --> 00:17:53,446
and it will become the

299
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:54,416
Now, let's talk a little bit

300
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:56,356
about the other type

301
00:17:56,356 --> 00:17:57,696
We have email notifications.

302
00:17:58,066 --> 00:17:59,326
Historically, in Xcode Server,

303
00:17:59,326 --> 00:18:02,856
this was always a one

304
00:17:59,326 --> 00:18:02,856
this was always a one

305
00:18:02,856 --> 00:18:04,696
which can leave you

306
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:08,156
So, in order to help you and

307
00:18:08,156 --> 00:18:10,946
in your inbox, we've split

308
00:18:10,946 --> 00:18:12,496
up into two different types.

309
00:18:12,876 --> 00:18:15,566
We still have the report

310
00:18:15,566 --> 00:18:17,466
that come out every time

311
00:18:17,886 --> 00:18:20,026
Of alternatively, you

312
00:18:20,446 --> 00:18:23,646
to run just once every

313
00:18:24,116 --> 00:18:25,756
This way, no matter how

314
00:18:25,756 --> 00:18:27,706
your email isn't flooded,

315
00:18:28,106 --> 00:18:29,836
or your inbox isn't flooded

316
00:18:29,836 --> 00:18:31,726
And we think this is great

317
00:18:31,726 --> 00:18:33,736
up on the health of

318
00:18:34,086 --> 00:18:37,096
but don't want all their inbox

319
00:18:39,296 --> 00:18:40,426
Additionally, we also, now,

320
00:18:40,426 --> 00:18:42,206
let you configure certain

321
00:18:42,206 --> 00:18:44,546
So, you can configure

322
00:18:44,546 --> 00:18:45,756
as your reply to fields.

323
00:18:46,506 --> 00:18:48,866
This lets you have a lot more

324
00:18:48,866 --> 00:18:50,466
of emails you're sending out.

325
00:18:51,626 --> 00:18:53,506
Now, I hinted a little bit

326
00:18:53,506 --> 00:18:55,086
have two different

327
00:18:55,086 --> 00:18:56,536
The other is issues.

328
00:18:56,976 --> 00:18:58,036
So, new issues come up.

329
00:18:58,036 --> 00:19:02,416
We will now send you an email

330
00:18:58,036 --> 00:19:02,416
We will now send you an email

331
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:03,576
for that particular issue.

332
00:19:03,696 --> 00:19:05,236
We'll go over a little

333
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:09,246
But, if you do have more

334
00:19:09,246 --> 00:19:10,226
of the code that

335
00:19:10,226 --> 00:19:11,616
than you necessarily

336
00:19:12,356 --> 00:19:14,016
we do let you filter

337
00:19:14,016 --> 00:19:15,936
to make sure you're emailing

338
00:19:17,386 --> 00:19:18,896
So, if we take a look at that.

339
00:19:20,386 --> 00:19:22,516
If you have multiple

340
00:19:23,006 --> 00:19:24,326
to only send emails

341
00:19:24,326 --> 00:19:27,406
from certain repositories,

342
00:19:27,406 --> 00:19:29,636
which domains all the

343
00:19:29,636 --> 00:19:31,106
from that you want

344
00:19:31,456 --> 00:19:35,196
you can add those right here.

345
00:19:36,046 --> 00:19:38,286
So, let's take a minute and

346
00:19:38,846 --> 00:19:40,256
or build issues anyways.

347
00:19:41,196 --> 00:19:44,656
And, nobody is perfect and

348
00:19:44,656 --> 00:19:46,436
That's the whole reason we

349
00:19:46,436 --> 00:19:47,846
That's why we have unit tests.

350
00:19:48,436 --> 00:19:50,146
We have unit tests

351
00:19:50,146 --> 00:19:51,386
that they will inevitably fail.

352
00:19:51,386 --> 00:19:53,196
That's why we write

353
00:19:54,106 --> 00:19:56,946
We also, occasionally, commit

354
00:19:56,946 --> 00:19:59,256
and some of us don't

355
00:19:59,256 --> 00:20:01,586
and that's exactly

356
00:19:59,256 --> 00:20:01,586
and that's exactly

357
00:20:01,856 --> 00:20:03,776
that continuous integration

358
00:20:04,206 --> 00:20:07,496
And, in these types of cases,

359
00:20:07,496 --> 00:20:09,096
and notify you that

360
00:20:09,986 --> 00:20:12,076
But those aren't the only

361
00:20:13,156 --> 00:20:15,216
Sometimes, even if you write

362
00:20:15,216 --> 00:20:16,546
things can change around you.

363
00:20:17,626 --> 00:20:20,256
That can be when you install a

364
00:20:20,256 --> 00:20:21,086
of other new features, too.

365
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:23,716
You get new SDKs that might

366
00:20:24,466 --> 00:20:26,566
You might get new issues

367
00:20:27,086 --> 00:20:29,376
And, we like to make

368
00:20:29,376 --> 00:20:31,606
that we ship is smarter than

369
00:20:31,606 --> 00:20:34,716
So, you might see issues

370
00:20:34,716 --> 00:20:36,486
that have always been

371
00:20:36,486 --> 00:20:37,816
such as static analysis issues.

372
00:20:40,876 --> 00:20:41,956
So, the important

373
00:20:41,956 --> 00:20:42,946
of these emails is

374
00:20:42,946 --> 00:20:44,886
to make sure it's

375
00:20:44,886 --> 00:20:47,316
that you're receiving this

376
00:20:47,316 --> 00:20:49,076
when it is because

377
00:20:49,076 --> 00:20:50,216
that you can do something about.

378
00:20:51,116 --> 00:20:53,636
So, the first type is if

379
00:20:54,146 --> 00:20:55,156
And that's because you broke it.

380
00:20:55,386 --> 00:20:58,586
So, this will call you out,

381
00:20:58,586 --> 00:20:59,506
You'll see an email like this

382
00:20:59,506 --> 00:21:00,776
that says you introduced

383
00:20:59,506 --> 00:21:00,776
that says you introduced

384
00:21:01,796 --> 00:21:03,706
And we know this because

385
00:21:03,706 --> 00:21:06,066
or near a line that you

386
00:21:07,486 --> 00:21:09,776
We also might know if,

387
00:21:09,776 --> 00:21:11,886
where the issue showed up, you

388
00:21:11,886 --> 00:21:15,466
In that case, that's

389
00:21:15,466 --> 00:21:17,126
that it's you that broke it.

390
00:21:17,886 --> 00:21:19,616
Now, that's not always the case.

391
00:21:19,616 --> 00:21:22,016
Take, for example, a

392
00:21:22,016 --> 00:21:22,996
on top of a framework.

393
00:21:23,356 --> 00:21:26,416
A change in the framework

394
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:28,836
in the application

395
00:21:28,836 --> 00:21:29,656
to the application.

396
00:21:30,216 --> 00:21:31,846
So, in this case, you'll see

397
00:21:31,846 --> 00:21:36,056
like this, and it'll be a little

398
00:21:36,056 --> 00:21:37,356
and will simply say

399
00:21:37,356 --> 00:21:39,426
to help fix an issue on the bot.

400
00:21:40,446 --> 00:21:43,306
And we know this because you

401
00:21:43,306 --> 00:21:44,116
where the issue showed up.

402
00:21:44,116 --> 00:21:46,556
So, we, essentially, assign

403
00:21:47,076 --> 00:21:50,496
And, keep in mind, that this

404
00:21:50,496 --> 00:21:52,246
than when we're directly

405
00:21:52,766 --> 00:21:55,306
So, expect this email to go out

406
00:21:55,306 --> 00:21:57,226
It casts a very wide net

407
00:21:57,226 --> 00:21:58,976
out who might be of interest

408
00:22:03,306 --> 00:22:05,706
Now, that's great for issues

409
00:22:05,706 --> 00:22:07,256
but sometimes, you can

410
00:22:07,256 --> 00:22:09,136
up regardless of code changes.

411
00:22:09,136 --> 00:22:11,756
One of the easiest ways

412
00:22:11,756 --> 00:22:12,916
by reconfiguring your bot.

413
00:22:13,746 --> 00:22:18,616
So, Xcode 8 or Xcode Server in

414
00:22:18,616 --> 00:22:20,966
to your bot configuration

415
00:22:21,946 --> 00:22:24,546
Whenever possible, we will

416
00:22:24,546 --> 00:22:26,746
that come up to changes

417
00:22:26,746 --> 00:22:29,786
such as if you enable testing

418
00:22:30,366 --> 00:22:32,426
Those types of issues may have

419
00:22:32,426 --> 00:22:34,816
but we can actually attribute

420
00:22:34,816 --> 00:22:36,796
in the configuration

421
00:22:36,796 --> 00:22:37,766
than a change in your code.

422
00:22:39,156 --> 00:22:41,326
We also make sure to include

423
00:22:41,326 --> 00:22:43,306
for the next integration,

424
00:22:43,306 --> 00:22:45,476
of these emails, you know that

425
00:22:45,476 --> 00:22:47,456
because you're picking up

426
00:22:50,516 --> 00:22:52,106
Let's go back to something

427
00:22:52,106 --> 00:22:53,906
of installing a new

428
00:22:53,906 --> 00:22:55,456
of new features in the process.

429
00:22:56,216 --> 00:22:58,826
Well, when that happens,

430
00:22:58,826 --> 00:23:02,036
on Xcode 8 will actually

431
00:22:58,826 --> 00:23:02,036
on Xcode 8 will actually

432
00:23:02,576 --> 00:23:04,106
and we call this an

433
00:23:05,296 --> 00:23:07,756
We take the exact same revision

434
00:23:07,756 --> 00:23:10,756
of all your repositories and

435
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:12,926
rebuild everything, rerun

436
00:23:13,516 --> 00:23:15,886
and when this happens, we

437
00:23:15,886 --> 00:23:19,686
up in your project at this

438
00:23:19,686 --> 00:23:21,206
are specifically

439
00:23:21,206 --> 00:23:23,056
since we took the exact

440
00:23:24,066 --> 00:23:26,256
This saves you a ton of time

441
00:23:26,256 --> 00:23:27,896
in your source code

442
00:23:27,896 --> 00:23:32,946
because the issues came up

443
00:23:33,046 --> 00:23:35,276
So, that's some of the new

444
00:23:35,276 --> 00:23:37,446
but I want to talk a little bit

445
00:23:37,446 --> 00:23:40,136
in Xcode Server and

446
00:23:40,136 --> 00:23:41,816
configurable integration user.

447
00:23:42,996 --> 00:23:44,536
So, we now give you full control

448
00:23:44,536 --> 00:23:47,086
of the macOS user that's

449
00:23:47,536 --> 00:23:49,516
And this gives you a lot

450
00:23:49,626 --> 00:23:51,316
into how your integrations

451
00:23:51,976 --> 00:23:53,076
and more to the point,

452
00:23:53,076 --> 00:23:55,436
to configure exactly how

453
00:23:55,946 --> 00:23:59,416
Historically, in Xcode Server,

454
00:23:59,416 --> 00:24:01,666
that was running all of your

455
00:23:59,416 --> 00:24:01,666
that was running all of your

456
00:24:02,076 --> 00:24:03,496
You wouldn't have

457
00:24:03,496 --> 00:24:05,186
and you wouldn't be

458
00:24:05,976 --> 00:24:08,516
This meant that you were

459
00:24:08,516 --> 00:24:10,366
no matter what, and you

460
00:24:11,596 --> 00:24:13,966
Now, you'll own and

461
00:24:13,966 --> 00:24:15,206
You will be given the password.

462
00:24:15,976 --> 00:24:18,586
This user will be a

463
00:24:18,586 --> 00:24:20,036
It'll be any user on the system.

464
00:24:20,036 --> 00:24:21,586
Can be anyone you want.

465
00:24:21,586 --> 00:24:22,786
We suggest a new user.

466
00:24:23,896 --> 00:24:25,836
But it will available

467
00:24:25,836 --> 00:24:27,166
and it's fast user switching.

468
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:28,866
So, you can log in to that user.

469
00:24:30,136 --> 00:24:31,816
You will notice you're

470
00:24:32,156 --> 00:24:35,226
through a menu extra that

471
00:24:35,436 --> 00:24:36,396
integration icon.

472
00:24:37,046 --> 00:24:37,996
We'll see that in just a minute.

473
00:24:38,316 --> 00:24:39,886
Let's go over how you

474
00:24:39,886 --> 00:24:42,936
So, here I've opened the server

475
00:24:43,256 --> 00:24:45,586
and in order to enable

476
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:47,326
I need to go ahead

477
00:24:47,516 --> 00:24:50,306
So, I'll choose a new Xcode

478
00:24:50,706 --> 00:24:53,466
and I'll be presented with

479
00:24:53,466 --> 00:24:56,066
up which integration user I

480
00:24:56,066 --> 00:24:57,506
to go ahead and create

481
00:24:57,506 --> 00:24:58,386
for running integrations.

482
00:24:59,056 --> 00:25:00,516
I'll go ahead and give it a name

483
00:24:59,056 --> 00:25:00,516
I'll go ahead and give it a name

484
00:25:00,516 --> 00:25:02,526
and a password, normal

485
00:25:02,966 --> 00:25:04,496
And I'm going to leave

486
00:25:04,606 --> 00:25:09,326
And when I push "create user,"

487
00:25:09,326 --> 00:25:10,256
and do a little bit of work

488
00:25:10,256 --> 00:25:12,526
in the background while

489
00:25:12,526 --> 00:25:15,956
to run integrations, and once

490
00:25:16,146 --> 00:25:17,816
we're going to be

491
00:25:18,536 --> 00:25:20,366
Now, we are asked to log in

492
00:25:20,366 --> 00:25:22,946
to go ahead and run a little

493
00:25:22,946 --> 00:25:25,426
Remember, it is a real,

494
00:25:26,246 --> 00:25:27,596
So I can log in, I can sign

495
00:25:27,596 --> 00:25:29,656
into a test iCloud

496
00:25:29,926 --> 00:25:33,076
I can stage any data that I want

497
00:25:33,216 --> 00:25:34,066
Anything like that.

498
00:25:34,476 --> 00:25:35,966
When Xcode's ready

499
00:25:35,966 --> 00:25:37,716
you will see a notification

500
00:25:37,716 --> 00:25:40,546
in the top right here, and in

501
00:25:40,546 --> 00:25:42,976
you'll notice that there is

502
00:25:43,306 --> 00:25:46,506
that this is the Xcode

503
00:25:47,166 --> 00:25:51,226
With that all done, I can

504
00:25:52,886 --> 00:25:55,346
and I'll be back in server app,

505
00:25:55,346 --> 00:25:58,306
that the user is ready

506
00:25:58,306 --> 00:25:59,946
and integrations

507
00:26:00,806 --> 00:26:02,246
So, now, we've seen how

508
00:26:02,246 --> 00:26:04,676
Let's take a look at some of

509
00:26:04,676 --> 00:26:06,496
that we have access to

510
00:26:06,986 --> 00:26:08,476
And for that, let's go

511
00:26:08,626 --> 00:26:09,036
All right.

512
00:26:09,036 --> 00:26:10,926
Here we have that same

513
00:26:11,956 --> 00:26:14,316
and we saw an issue

514
00:26:15,326 --> 00:26:16,896
because it didn't have

515
00:26:16,896 --> 00:26:18,806
And we had to go in

516
00:26:19,096 --> 00:26:21,156
and turn off location

517
00:26:21,616 --> 00:26:22,986
But, as we're developing

518
00:26:22,986 --> 00:26:24,036
we might not want to do that.

519
00:26:24,036 --> 00:26:25,856
We probably want to leave

520
00:26:25,856 --> 00:26:28,236
on on our Apple TVs

521
00:26:28,236 --> 00:26:30,546
so that we're running,

522
00:26:30,546 --> 00:26:32,616
of our users will see it and

523
00:26:33,486 --> 00:26:35,736
But, now that we've fixed

524
00:26:35,736 --> 00:26:37,066
we definitely don't want

525
00:26:37,066 --> 00:26:38,896
and we want to be

526
00:26:39,606 --> 00:26:41,386
So, it just so happens that

527
00:26:41,386 --> 00:26:43,486
on right now, happens

528
00:26:43,486 --> 00:26:45,396
So, I don't have to go

529
00:26:45,396 --> 00:26:47,946
I can actually just go to

530
00:26:48,196 --> 00:26:50,996
and I see that have a

531
00:26:50,996 --> 00:26:54,936
integration user

532
00:26:55,006 --> 00:26:57,076
And I'm just going to

533
00:26:57,516 --> 00:27:01,456
and enter my super-secret

534
00:26:57,516 --> 00:27:01,456
and enter my super-secret

535
00:27:03,156 --> 00:27:05,456
characters long.

536
00:27:05,676 --> 00:27:06,956
And we will log in as this user.

537
00:27:07,236 --> 00:27:09,306
So, I've gone ahead and

538
00:27:09,306 --> 00:27:10,916
so that I know that it's

539
00:27:11,746 --> 00:27:15,316
And, here we see the hammer

540
00:27:15,316 --> 00:27:16,526
that this is Xcode Server.

541
00:27:16,556 --> 00:27:18,336
We see it's on and

542
00:27:18,906 --> 00:27:19,756
So, it's all configured,

543
00:27:20,476 --> 00:27:22,446
but I want to go ahead

544
00:27:22,446 --> 00:27:25,566
So, I can actually configure any

545
00:27:25,566 --> 00:27:28,176
on this user, and they will be

546
00:27:28,176 --> 00:27:30,456
So, I'm going to use

547
00:27:30,456 --> 00:27:33,756
If I go to the devices

548
00:27:33,756 --> 00:27:36,156
and simulators that are plugged

549
00:27:36,656 --> 00:27:38,856
Now, being generous at

550
00:27:38,856 --> 00:27:41,626
of every device we've ever

551
00:27:41,626 --> 00:27:44,766
for you, for absolutely free,

552
00:27:44,766 --> 00:27:45,966
by clicking this

553
00:27:46,886 --> 00:27:49,586
Now, the Apple TV 1080p

554
00:27:49,586 --> 00:27:51,196
that I got when I

555
00:27:51,566 --> 00:27:54,246
I've gone ahead and created

556
00:27:54,246 --> 00:27:56,796
location, and I've

557
00:27:57,046 --> 00:28:00,406
And if I go in, I can double

558
00:27:57,046 --> 00:28:00,406
And if I go in, I can double

559
00:28:01,996 --> 00:28:04,006
has location services

560
00:28:04,596 --> 00:28:07,606
So, I go to settings,

561
00:28:08,156 --> 00:28:09,386
Location services is turned off.

562
00:28:09,496 --> 00:28:11,206
So, this simulator is

563
00:28:11,236 --> 00:28:12,686
and my other one's still usable

564
00:28:12,686 --> 00:28:14,586
for when I want location

565
00:28:15,536 --> 00:28:18,286
Now, let's do a quick

566
00:28:19,466 --> 00:28:21,316
and just log back

567
00:28:21,316 --> 00:28:22,806
Normally, I'd be

568
00:28:22,806 --> 00:28:24,946
to my actual work machine,

569
00:28:26,006 --> 00:28:27,626
And here we see all

570
00:28:27,626 --> 00:28:30,136
Now, I already have a bot that's

571
00:28:30,136 --> 00:28:31,776
but I want to go

572
00:28:31,776 --> 00:28:33,596
that will integrate

573
00:28:33,596 --> 00:28:34,916
where we don't have

574
00:28:35,156 --> 00:28:37,016
So, I'm going to go

575
00:28:37,106 --> 00:28:40,206
and use the Harmony no

576
00:28:40,626 --> 00:28:43,046
Going to go ahead and

577
00:28:43,046 --> 00:28:46,336
access to my repository so

578
00:28:46,796 --> 00:28:49,276
I'm going to disable

579
00:28:49,276 --> 00:28:50,816
because this will be the

580
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:52,736
So, I don't care about that,

581
00:28:53,246 --> 00:28:54,926
And, let's leave

582
00:28:56,126 --> 00:28:57,886
And I want to be notified

583
00:28:58,006 --> 00:29:00,646
but probably once a

584
00:28:58,006 --> 00:29:00,646
but probably once a

585
00:29:00,736 --> 00:29:03,726
So, I'll know within 24 hours

586
00:29:03,726 --> 00:29:05,346
our UI test will catch

587
00:29:06,076 --> 00:29:08,896
So, we'll just run it every

588
00:29:08,896 --> 00:29:09,916
to select the devices.

589
00:29:10,386 --> 00:29:14,086
By default, every integration

590
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:15,886
So, this is a tvOS

591
00:29:15,886 --> 00:29:17,886
on all tvOS devices

592
00:29:18,566 --> 00:29:21,656
Instead, let's do specific TV

593
00:29:21,656 --> 00:29:23,116
to select the Apple

594
00:29:23,486 --> 00:29:26,546
This is that environment

595
00:29:26,546 --> 00:29:27,106
about earlier.

596
00:29:27,276 --> 00:29:28,976
I don't have any

597
00:29:29,086 --> 00:29:31,136
I'm going to go ahead and

598
00:29:31,136 --> 00:29:33,206
when a new issue comes up

599
00:29:33,366 --> 00:29:36,986
and go ahead and create the bot.

600
00:29:37,616 --> 00:29:39,396
So, that is going to go ahead

601
00:29:39,396 --> 00:29:40,536
which we see running here.

602
00:29:40,536 --> 00:29:41,756
It's checking out building.

603
00:29:42,246 --> 00:29:44,166
We've already seen the

604
00:29:44,166 --> 00:29:45,966
so let's actually

605
00:29:45,966 --> 00:29:47,846
that I prebaked a

606
00:29:48,246 --> 00:29:49,066
And if we go to the test,

607
00:29:49,066 --> 00:29:51,816
we can see that it did run all

608
00:29:51,846 --> 00:29:52,426
code test.

609
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:55,166
And we can see, if I look at

610
00:29:55,166 --> 00:29:57,466
it is, indeed, running without

611
00:29:57,466 --> 00:30:01,766
that ViewController

612
00:29:57,466 --> 00:30:01,766
that ViewController

613
00:30:02,436 --> 00:30:03,566
So, we saw how you were able

614
00:30:03,566 --> 00:30:05,586
to get significantly

615
00:30:05,586 --> 00:30:06,796
into how your user runs.

616
00:30:06,796 --> 00:30:10,946
You can log in as them and see

617
00:30:11,086 --> 00:30:12,986
We saw how you could

618
00:30:12,986 --> 00:30:16,486
such as simulators to run

619
00:30:16,486 --> 00:30:17,846
that you want to run

620
00:30:18,706 --> 00:30:20,706
We saw this was a

621
00:30:20,706 --> 00:30:22,796
that I was able to switch

622
00:30:22,886 --> 00:30:24,106
and that I had the password to.

623
00:30:24,956 --> 00:30:26,326
And, we got to see

624
00:30:26,326 --> 00:30:28,446
that shows you a little bit

625
00:30:28,546 --> 00:30:31,656
in that integration user.

626
00:30:33,326 --> 00:30:34,896
Now, with this great new

627
00:30:34,896 --> 00:30:37,116
of responsibility, and so

628
00:30:37,116 --> 00:30:37,446
for you.

629
00:30:37,946 --> 00:30:40,166
First, we highly recommend

630
00:30:40,236 --> 00:30:42,776
You want this to be as similar

631
00:30:42,776 --> 00:30:44,606
as possible, so you don't

632
00:30:45,146 --> 00:30:47,516
to be causing impact

633
00:30:48,816 --> 00:30:51,126
We also recommend you avoid

634
00:30:51,236 --> 00:30:53,346
Keep in mind that anyone

635
00:30:53,346 --> 00:30:55,206
on your serve will have

636
00:30:55,206 --> 00:30:57,036
through triggers, so

637
00:30:57,036 --> 00:30:58,616
for any private or

638
00:30:58,746 --> 00:31:00,486
Try to avoid storing

639
00:30:58,746 --> 00:31:00,486
Try to avoid storing

640
00:31:02,296 --> 00:31:04,726
If you want to stay logged in

641
00:31:04,836 --> 00:31:05,926
use fast user switching.

642
00:31:05,926 --> 00:31:07,266
Integrations can continue to run

643
00:31:07,266 --> 00:31:08,846
in the background just

644
00:31:10,086 --> 00:31:12,006
However, if you do want

645
00:31:12,006 --> 00:31:13,006
as the front most user,

646
00:31:13,006 --> 00:31:14,786
make sure that you

647
00:31:14,786 --> 00:31:16,616
Just like iOS screen

648
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:17,886
so does macOS screen lock.

649
00:31:19,286 --> 00:31:20,686
And finally, make

650
00:31:20,686 --> 00:31:21,896
for whatever needs you have.

651
00:31:22,316 --> 00:31:24,496
That includes, as we saw

652
00:31:24,576 --> 00:31:26,496
If you have any specific

653
00:31:26,496 --> 00:31:27,716
that you need for

654
00:31:28,636 --> 00:31:32,196
any stage user data or settings

655
00:31:32,306 --> 00:31:33,416
go ahead and configure those.

656
00:31:34,526 --> 00:31:36,266
And finally, if you have

657
00:31:36,266 --> 00:31:38,656
such as if your administrator

658
00:31:38,656 --> 00:31:40,816
profile, however you

659
00:31:40,816 --> 00:31:41,646
you can actually configure

660
00:31:41,646 --> 00:31:44,686
that in your configurable

661
00:31:44,686 --> 00:31:47,076
and make sure that code

662
00:31:47,686 --> 00:31:49,846
So, with that, I'm going to

663
00:31:49,846 --> 00:31:52,836
about some new features

666
00:32:01,016 --> 00:32:01,566
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Eric.

667
00:32:03,896 --> 00:32:07,936
So, you've seen new features

668
00:32:08,606 --> 00:32:10,866
and now we have new features

669
00:32:12,816 --> 00:32:15,136
xcodebuild has the test action

670
00:32:15,136 --> 00:32:18,696
for custom continuous

671
00:32:19,706 --> 00:32:22,076
You give it a workspace, a

672
00:32:22,596 --> 00:32:25,426
and xcodebuild will

673
00:32:26,136 --> 00:32:30,026
It will install built products

674
00:32:31,516 --> 00:32:34,466
It will run your tests,

675
00:32:34,466 --> 00:32:35,766
to you on the command line.

676
00:32:37,796 --> 00:32:41,866
So, this year, we're introducing

677
00:32:42,796 --> 00:32:44,646
With the only testing option,

678
00:32:44,676 --> 00:32:47,906
you can effectively

679
00:32:48,416 --> 00:32:49,656
that the action will run.

680
00:32:49,656 --> 00:32:57,666
So, you can specify TestCases or

681
00:32:57,666 --> 00:33:00,306
to the exclusion of other tests.

682
00:32:57,666 --> 00:33:00,306
to the exclusion of other tests.

683
00:33:02,226 --> 00:33:04,426
And you can also use

684
00:33:04,726 --> 00:33:08,286
to specify TestCases to exclude

685
00:33:08,286 --> 00:33:10,466
from the tests while

686
00:33:10,986 --> 00:33:14,266
And the big news this year is

687
00:33:14,266 --> 00:33:17,056
that we're introducing two

688
00:33:17,566 --> 00:33:21,576
So, we're effectively splitting

689
00:33:22,526 --> 00:33:26,916
These actions are already

690
00:33:28,046 --> 00:33:29,846
but we're going to bring

691
00:33:30,626 --> 00:33:32,306
And so, we'll look

692
00:33:34,776 --> 00:33:38,176
Build for testing is just

693
00:33:38,256 --> 00:33:39,286
of the test action.

694
00:33:40,636 --> 00:33:44,266
So, you give it a workspace,

695
00:33:44,266 --> 00:33:48,026
as before, and it will

696
00:33:48,816 --> 00:33:50,766
perhaps making certain

697
00:33:51,796 --> 00:33:54,676
and then it will output the

698
00:33:55,976 --> 00:33:58,396
It also produces

699
00:33:58,736 --> 00:33:59,916
It's a kind of manifest

700
00:33:59,916 --> 00:34:01,626
for everything your

701
00:33:59,916 --> 00:34:01,626
for everything your

702
00:34:02,396 --> 00:34:04,306
We'll come back to

703
00:34:06,206 --> 00:34:10,315
Test without building then, is

704
00:34:11,525 --> 00:34:13,116
You give it a workspace,

705
00:34:13,116 --> 00:34:14,676
and a destination, as before.

706
00:34:15,826 --> 00:34:20,166
And, xcodebuild will find the

707
00:34:20,235 --> 00:34:23,085
It will install those

708
00:34:23,716 --> 00:34:26,976
and then run your tests and

709
00:34:34,045 --> 00:34:36,666
But the cool thing

710
00:34:36,666 --> 00:34:38,056
to provide a workspace.

711
00:34:39,496 --> 00:34:43,545
Instead, you can just

712
00:34:44,016 --> 00:34:47,196
and Xcode will run your

713
00:34:48,525 --> 00:34:51,186
So, it will ingest

714
00:34:51,186 --> 00:34:54,266
It will find binary products

715
00:34:54,976 --> 00:34:57,856
and then it will run the

716
00:34:58,706 --> 00:35:00,166
in exactly the same

717
00:34:58,706 --> 00:35:00,166
in exactly the same

718
00:35:00,166 --> 00:35:02,896
but without having any

719
00:35:04,356 --> 00:35:05,576
So, this is ideal

720
00:35:05,576 --> 00:35:07,516
for distributed testing

721
00:35:08,436 --> 00:35:12,186
You would build your tests

722
00:35:12,186 --> 00:35:16,396
for building, and then

723
00:35:16,396 --> 00:35:19,036
onto machines optimized

724
00:35:19,256 --> 00:35:24,366
And then, in parallel, you

725
00:35:27,046 --> 00:35:29,726
So, this is all made possible

726
00:35:30,246 --> 00:35:34,386
that manifest for your tests

727
00:35:34,386 --> 00:35:37,076
to run and which to skip

728
00:35:38,436 --> 00:35:40,036
It provides environment

729
00:35:40,036 --> 00:35:42,266
and command line

730
00:35:43,256 --> 00:35:44,676

00:36:00,046 --> 00:36:03,856
We first reviewed testing in

735
00:36:04,286 --> 00:36:08,796
and then we looked at some

736
00:36:09,686 --> 00:36:12,626
They were great for diagnosing

737
00:36:13,126 --> 00:36:16,456
and then we introduced

738
00:36:17,116 --> 00:36:19,536
in Xcode Server,

739
00:36:22,516 --> 00:36:25,436
I hope these insights and

740
00:36:25,436 --> 00:36:28,226
to develop test suites which

741
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:31,786
