[ Applause ]

3
00:00:27,116 --> 00:00:29,696
&gt;&gt; Thank you, hello

4
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:32,375
to Controlling Game

5
00:00:32,976 --> 00:00:36,086
I'm JJ Cwik, Game

6
00:00:36,916 --> 00:00:41,876
Now when we introduce Apple

7
00:00:41,876 --> 00:00:43,516
about the 10 foot experience.

8
00:00:44,316 --> 00:00:47,016
We talked about it being a

9
00:00:47,446 --> 00:00:50,426
one that's ideally suited

10
00:00:51,376 --> 00:00:52,716
And the fact of the matter is

11
00:00:52,866 --> 00:00:55,386
that people just love playing

12
00:00:56,136 --> 00:00:57,906
and Apple TV is great for that.

13
00:00:58,426 --> 00:01:00,036
It gives you the tools you need

14
00:00:58,426 --> 00:01:00,036
It gives you the tools you need

15
00:01:00,286 --> 00:01:02,756
to create really

16
00:01:03,596 --> 00:01:07,236
And I'm really happy to talk to

17
00:01:07,846 --> 00:01:09,776
MFi game controllers and how

18
00:01:09,776 --> 00:01:11,686
to best integrate

19
00:01:12,966 --> 00:01:15,856
Now before I start

20
00:01:15,986 --> 00:01:17,926
here's what's new in tvOS 10.

21
00:01:18,736 --> 00:01:23,036
As you heard on Monday, games

22
00:01:23,326 --> 00:01:24,436
that cannot be supported

23
00:01:24,436 --> 00:01:29,036
by the Siri Remote can

24
00:01:29,036 --> 00:01:33,216
requirement that they

25
00:01:34,416 --> 00:01:36,926
Now we've also included

26
00:01:36,926 --> 00:01:38,976
to four MFi game controllers.

27
00:01:39,236 --> 00:01:41,526
This is going to be great

28
00:01:42,986 --> 00:01:46,816
And as you also heard on Monday,

29
00:01:47,276 --> 00:01:51,316
that can be used to control

30
00:01:51,316 --> 00:01:52,486
as a game input device.

31
00:01:53,226 --> 00:01:55,036
Now I'll talk about all

32
00:01:55,036 --> 00:01:58,686
of the talk, so let's

33
00:01:58,806 --> 00:02:02,976
Now apps on tvOS

34
00:01:58,806 --> 00:02:02,976
Now apps on tvOS

35
00:02:02,976 --> 00:02:06,966
from the focus engine or

36
00:02:07,256 --> 00:02:09,515
from touches and gestures.

37
00:02:10,545 --> 00:02:13,026
But there's also a third

38
00:02:13,026 --> 00:02:15,836
to read inputs directly

39
00:02:16,096 --> 00:02:18,816
and game controllers with the

40
00:02:19,446 --> 00:02:22,356
Now let me give you

41
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:24,756
of the Game Controller

42
00:02:24,756 --> 00:02:25,976
who may not be familiar with it.

43
00:02:26,716 --> 00:02:28,916
The Game Controller framework

44
00:02:29,256 --> 00:02:32,506
to expose third-party game

45
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:35,286
These compatible game

46
00:02:35,396 --> 00:02:36,476
MFi controllers.

47
00:02:37,476 --> 00:02:39,296
Now the framework has

48
00:02:39,296 --> 00:02:41,536
to also include support

49
00:02:42,836 --> 00:02:47,056
The Game Controller framework

50
00:02:47,056 --> 00:02:50,766
that allows you to

51
00:02:51,146 --> 00:02:53,816
and use the same

52
00:02:54,016 --> 00:02:55,366
of the controller vendors.

53
00:02:56,796 --> 00:02:58,936
It standardizes detection

54
00:03:00,176 --> 00:03:02,346
It seamlessly handles

55
00:03:02,346 --> 00:03:04,446
and disconnect while

56
00:03:05,176 --> 00:03:08,656
And it allows you to

57
00:03:08,656 --> 00:03:11,616
to read inputs off of the

58
00:03:11,786 --> 00:03:12,886
or an event-driven model.

59
00:03:14,246 --> 00:03:18,866
And it's also available

60
00:03:19,736 --> 00:03:23,176
And so even though this talk

61
00:03:23,176 --> 00:03:26,876
of the code and concepts

62
00:03:26,876 --> 00:03:30,956
So now that you have

63
00:03:30,956 --> 00:03:34,566
of the framework I'd like to

64
00:03:35,766 --> 00:03:36,976
There is a core class

65
00:03:37,116 --> 00:03:39,556
in the Game Controller

66
00:03:39,926 --> 00:03:41,806
This represents physical

67
00:03:42,456 --> 00:03:44,476
and it's the same class

68
00:03:44,746 --> 00:03:46,316
and MFi game controllers.

69
00:03:46,846 --> 00:03:50,666
Now the first thing you're

70
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:52,456
in your app is to get a list

71
00:03:52,456 --> 00:03:54,206
of all the currently

72
00:03:54,706 --> 00:03:57,586
And to do this you use the

73
00:03:57,906 --> 00:03:59,036
on GCController.

74
00:03:59,686 --> 00:04:02,586
This returns you a list of the

75
00:03:59,686 --> 00:04:02,586
This returns you a list of the

76
00:04:02,836 --> 00:04:05,126
as an array of GCController

77
00:04:05,846 --> 00:04:08,786
or an empty array if none exist.

78
00:04:10,796 --> 00:04:13,926
It's also common for controllers

79
00:04:14,126 --> 00:04:20,055
as your app is running and to be

80
00:04:20,236 --> 00:04:23,686
for the GCCcontrollerDidConnect

81
00:04:23,986 --> 00:04:26,466
and GCControllerDidDisconnect

82
00:04:27,326 --> 00:04:29,476
A great place to do this is

83
00:04:29,476 --> 00:04:31,996
in your application Did

84
00:04:33,816 --> 00:04:36,666
So now we know which controllers

85
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:38,846
like to shift focus and

86
00:04:39,606 --> 00:04:41,826
Now the Siri Remote is

87
00:04:41,966 --> 00:04:44,956
as a game controller using

88
00:04:44,956 --> 00:04:45,756
that I just mentioned.

89
00:04:47,176 --> 00:04:49,696
And in the Game Controller

90
00:04:49,696 --> 00:04:53,976
of profiles and profiles grouped

91
00:04:54,506 --> 00:04:56,796
and the Siri Remote

92
00:04:57,456 --> 00:05:00,236
The first is called

93
00:04:57,456 --> 00:05:00,236
The first is called

94
00:05:00,936 --> 00:05:03,446
This is what you use to

95
00:05:03,656 --> 00:05:05,606
and the buttons on

96
00:05:06,856 --> 00:05:11,146
The second profile that the

97
00:05:11,146 --> 00:05:15,136
GCMotion and this is what you

98
00:05:15,236 --> 00:05:17,326
and accelerometer

99
00:05:18,196 --> 00:05:20,656
Now note that this is different

100
00:05:20,656 --> 00:05:23,006
to on iOS where motion comes

101
00:05:23,006 --> 00:05:24,356
through the CoreMotion

102
00:05:25,786 --> 00:05:29,036
On tvOS motion comes through

103
00:05:30,376 --> 00:05:32,566
So let's look at each of

104
00:05:33,146 --> 00:05:35,466
First, the GCMicroGamepad.

105
00:05:38,026 --> 00:05:41,016
Now the touch surface on

106
00:05:41,016 --> 00:05:43,906
to your game as a

107
00:05:44,696 --> 00:05:49,746
And you can query its value

108
00:05:49,996 --> 00:05:55,356
as an XY coordinate pair or

109
00:05:55,356 --> 00:05:58,086
as four buttons up,

110
00:06:00,756 --> 00:06:03,956
The GCMicroGamepad profile

111
00:06:04,236 --> 00:06:06,286
and this corresponds

112
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:10,366
This is ideally suited for the

113
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:12,246
especially when the

114
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:13,546
in portrait orientation.

115
00:06:14,106 --> 00:06:19,576
And the profile also has

116
00:06:19,576 --> 00:06:21,476
as a secondary action

117
00:06:22,376 --> 00:06:25,166
and it becomes really natural

118
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:27,516
on its side and held in

119
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:29,876
to have a thumb on

120
00:06:30,096 --> 00:06:32,006
and another thumb

121
00:06:33,876 --> 00:06:36,426
Now note that there's also a

122
00:06:37,306 --> 00:06:39,046
I'll be talking about

123
00:06:39,956 --> 00:06:41,156
And the remainder of the buttons

124
00:06:41,156 --> 00:06:43,466
on the remote are

125
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:49,006
Here's a code example

126
00:06:49,006 --> 00:06:50,726
to read inputs off

127
00:06:51,396 --> 00:06:55,276
Here we see we have a controller

128
00:06:56,036 --> 00:06:58,726
and from that we can read

129
00:06:59,856 --> 00:07:02,766
That stores the button A

130
00:06:59,856 --> 00:07:02,766
That stores the button A

131
00:07:03,316 --> 00:07:05,776
and from there we just

132
00:07:06,106 --> 00:07:08,766
to determine whether or not

133
00:07:09,446 --> 00:07:12,136
Now we also support

134
00:07:12,796 --> 00:07:14,126
So if you want to be notified

135
00:07:14,126 --> 00:07:15,916
when the buttons are

136
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:17,656
to poll you can do that.

137
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:20,806
These are called the

138
00:07:21,776 --> 00:07:24,406
and this block of code that

139
00:07:24,406 --> 00:07:25,386
button changes state.

140
00:07:26,336 --> 00:07:27,606
Notice of this is called twice

141
00:07:27,606 --> 00:07:30,306
for traditional button

142
00:07:30,606 --> 00:07:31,846
and another time on button up.

143
00:07:33,456 --> 00:07:34,346
So those are the buttons.

144
00:07:34,726 --> 00:07:35,836
Let's look at the DPAD now.

145
00:07:36,876 --> 00:07:38,796
The DPAD as I mentioned

146
00:07:38,796 --> 00:07:40,866
as four buttons up,

147
00:07:40,866 --> 00:07:43,386
And interestingly, has

148
00:07:43,626 --> 00:07:46,336
as two axes, xAxis and yAxis.

149
00:07:46,656 --> 00:07:47,526
So let's look at those.

150
00:07:49,516 --> 00:07:52,476
Here you can see there's a DPAD

151
00:07:52,926 --> 00:07:55,346
and it has xAxis and

152
00:07:55,986 --> 00:07:57,846
From there we read

153
00:07:57,846 --> 00:08:02,006
which returns a float normalized

154
00:07:57,846 --> 00:08:02,006
which returns a float normalized

155
00:08:02,146 --> 00:08:04,946
normalized between

156
00:08:06,376 --> 00:08:09,276
Now as you'd expect, we also

157
00:08:09,596 --> 00:08:13,586
And note in this case our

158
00:08:13,586 --> 00:08:15,196
or we're supplying a

159
00:08:15,196 --> 00:08:18,606
on the DPAD itself not

160
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:21,816
This is because we want to

161
00:08:21,816 --> 00:08:23,516
of those two axes changes.

162
00:08:24,066 --> 00:08:29,846
Now there's some interesting

163
00:08:29,886 --> 00:08:31,000
that I'd like to talk

164
00:08:39,066 --> 00:08:40,836
And the first one is

165
00:08:41,785 --> 00:08:44,706
Now what this is is it really

166
00:08:44,706 --> 00:08:46,956
of your x and yAxis

167
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:49,896
Now you might be wondering

168
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:54,286
at the center and the answer is

169
00:08:54,986 --> 00:08:57,816
A lot of times a player doesn't

170
00:08:57,816 --> 00:08:59,896
with the precise location

171
00:08:59,896 --> 00:09:02,276
on the touch surface,

172
00:08:59,896 --> 00:09:02,276
on the touch surface,

173
00:09:02,276 --> 00:09:04,296
to put their thumb

174
00:09:04,296 --> 00:09:05,656
to where they initially

175
00:09:06,326 --> 00:09:08,366
And that's what DPAD

176
00:09:08,366 --> 00:09:10,956
as a game developer is to tap

177
00:09:11,516 --> 00:09:12,766
So initial touch downs

178
00:09:12,766 --> 00:09:15,136
on the touch surface

179
00:09:15,556 --> 00:09:20,216
and then further movement from

180
00:09:20,216 --> 00:09:22,136
to your game relative

181
00:09:22,836 --> 00:09:24,196
Let me explain with an example.

182
00:09:25,076 --> 00:09:26,466
So here's our touch surface

183
00:09:26,466 --> 00:09:28,056
and I place my thumb

184
00:09:28,516 --> 00:09:31,296
Notice it's not at the

185
00:09:32,076 --> 00:09:36,056
but with DPAD windowing

186
00:09:36,056 --> 00:09:39,146
for our x and yAxis

187
00:09:39,606 --> 00:09:43,906
Also note there's an imaginary

188
00:09:43,906 --> 00:09:45,656
of that centered

189
00:09:46,456 --> 00:09:48,066
Now watch what happens

190
00:09:48,066 --> 00:09:49,216
across the touch surface.

191
00:09:51,196 --> 00:09:54,546
The values reported to your

192
00:09:54,906 --> 00:09:57,056
and in proportion to

193
00:09:57,976 --> 00:09:59,886
Now as I continue

194
00:09:59,886 --> 00:10:02,806
across the touch surface

195
00:09:59,886 --> 00:10:02,806
across the touch surface

196
00:10:02,986 --> 00:10:04,936
and the axis along with it.

197
00:10:06,386 --> 00:10:10,306
Now we have established a new

198
00:10:10,306 --> 00:10:13,446
across the touch surface

199
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,426
to your game relative

200
00:10:16,226 --> 00:10:17,336
So that's DPAD windowing.

201
00:10:18,716 --> 00:10:22,026
If you want to receive absolute

202
00:10:22,026 --> 00:10:25,396
opt into this with the

203
00:10:25,446 --> 00:10:30,856
property, set this to true

204
00:10:30,856 --> 00:10:33,356
at the physical midpoint

205
00:10:34,086 --> 00:10:35,926
Then as I place my

206
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:39,716
across the touch surface all

207
00:10:39,716 --> 00:10:41,816
to the physical midpoint

208
00:10:42,186 --> 00:10:44,000
So that's DPAD windowing.

209
00:10:50,136 --> 00:10:51,546
Next up rotation.

210
00:10:51,906 --> 00:10:54,866
So the DPAD values

211
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:57,866
in portrait orientation

212
00:10:57,866 --> 00:11:00,236
to the right and Y is going up.

213
00:10:57,866 --> 00:11:00,236
to the right and Y is going up.

214
00:11:00,896 --> 00:11:03,346
However, this might cause a

215
00:11:03,346 --> 00:11:05,076
to play in landscape

216
00:11:05,766 --> 00:11:09,176
In this case, your game would

217
00:11:09,776 --> 00:11:11,726
so that it's proper

218
00:11:12,306 --> 00:11:14,936
But then what happens if

219
00:11:14,936 --> 00:11:16,746
in the other direction,

220
00:11:16,746 --> 00:11:19,066
to transpose those values

221
00:11:20,566 --> 00:11:22,576
And how would you even do

222
00:11:22,616 --> 00:11:24,486
to force the player to play

223
00:11:24,486 --> 00:11:28,006
in a particular orientation

224
00:11:28,006 --> 00:11:29,576
to start reading

225
00:11:29,576 --> 00:11:31,606
and track the orientation

226
00:11:31,976 --> 00:11:33,556
And this isn't something

227
00:11:34,236 --> 00:11:37,486
So we've provided a property

228
00:11:37,976 --> 00:11:40,176
Now by default this

229
00:11:40,766 --> 00:11:43,806
But if you set it to true,

230
00:11:43,806 --> 00:11:46,176
to your game will

231
00:11:46,176 --> 00:11:48,556
to whatever orientation the

232
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,316
So when this is true

233
00:11:51,316 --> 00:11:53,286
in portrait orientation

234
00:11:53,286 --> 00:11:54,806
to the right and Y is going up.

235
00:11:56,066 --> 00:12:00,126
And in landscape left X is going

236
00:11:56,066 --> 00:12:00,126
And in landscape left X is going

237
00:12:00,626 --> 00:12:03,626
And in landscape right

238
00:12:03,626 --> 00:12:05,266
to the right and Y is going up.

239
00:12:06,196 --> 00:12:08,356
So if your game wants

240
00:12:08,356 --> 00:12:12,066
in landscape orientation

241
00:12:12,506 --> 00:12:14,906
so you don't have to worry

242
00:12:14,966 --> 00:12:16,666
or rotating DPAD

243
00:12:17,106 --> 00:12:18,856
So that's rotation.

244
00:12:19,726 --> 00:12:20,736
Next up motion.

245
00:12:22,146 --> 00:12:25,076
As I mentioned earlier,

246
00:12:25,076 --> 00:12:27,616
that the Siri Remote

247
00:12:28,936 --> 00:12:32,066
Now as the user moves the

248
00:12:32,066 --> 00:12:34,476
in user acceleration

249
00:12:34,476 --> 00:12:36,596
by the GCMotion profile

250
00:12:38,146 --> 00:12:40,726
Note that these values are

251
00:12:40,726 --> 00:12:41,386
to your game.

252
00:12:41,766 --> 00:12:43,416
So if you have a tvOS game

253
00:12:43,676 --> 00:12:46,766
and you're doing motion

254
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:49,406
that so that you don't

255
00:12:49,406 --> 00:12:50,646
into your game.

256
00:12:51,986 --> 00:12:56,426
Also, this is fused motion data

257
00:12:56,426 --> 00:13:00,116
that the accelerometer and the

258
00:12:56,426 --> 00:13:00,116
that the accelerometer and the

259
00:13:00,116 --> 00:13:01,066
and correct each other.

260
00:13:01,746 --> 00:13:05,396
So just like on your

261
00:13:05,686 --> 00:13:09,106
from the accelerometer

262
00:13:09,106 --> 00:13:12,576
in the gyroscope and

263
00:13:12,576 --> 00:13:15,426
to smooth the values coming

264
00:13:15,996 --> 00:13:17,036
They reinforce each other.

265
00:13:18,156 --> 00:13:20,786
But really, vigorous

266
00:13:21,236 --> 00:13:24,606
so for this reason we recommend

267
00:13:24,606 --> 00:13:26,896
in your game that

268
00:13:27,146 --> 00:13:28,756
to vigorously shake the remote.

269
00:13:29,376 --> 00:13:31,756
Because this causes data

270
00:13:32,076 --> 00:13:34,376
until the sensors have

271
00:13:37,126 --> 00:13:39,886
Next up I want to talk

272
00:13:43,476 --> 00:13:46,346
Now all controllers

273
00:13:46,396 --> 00:13:48,596
in the Game Controller

274
00:13:49,226 --> 00:13:51,426
It's the same Menu button

275
00:13:51,646 --> 00:13:54,656
on the Siri Remote and

276
00:13:58,936 --> 00:14:04,036
Now in an app on tvOS when

277
00:13:58,936 --> 00:14:04,036
Now in an app on tvOS when

278
00:14:04,036 --> 00:14:07,586
recommended behavior changes

279
00:14:08,066 --> 00:14:11,356
Sometimes pressing the Menu

280
00:14:11,836 --> 00:14:13,886
and return you back to

281
00:14:15,576 --> 00:14:17,676
That's typically done in

282
00:14:18,676 --> 00:14:22,636
At other times pressing the Menu

283
00:14:22,826 --> 00:14:25,316
in your apps menu hierarchy

284
00:14:25,766 --> 00:14:27,646
and this is typically

285
00:14:30,326 --> 00:14:33,946
Lastly, pressing the Menu

286
00:14:33,946 --> 00:14:35,856
or resumes your active gameplay.

287
00:14:39,056 --> 00:14:42,706
Now nongame apps

288
00:14:42,706 --> 00:14:46,506
in UIKit get the first two

289
00:14:46,506 --> 00:14:50,536
without any additional

290
00:14:50,536 --> 00:14:54,256
to their custom UI have to do

291
00:14:54,536 --> 00:14:56,326
to indicate to the

292
00:14:57,266 --> 00:14:57,966
Let me explain.

293
00:15:00,736 --> 00:15:03,726
So in UIKit when the

294
00:15:04,176 --> 00:15:07,986
for UIKit apps it pops the child

295
00:15:08,476 --> 00:15:11,536
This returns you back to your

296
00:15:12,616 --> 00:15:14,156
Now you can do this successively

297
00:15:14,156 --> 00:15:18,006
with each Menu button press

298
00:15:18,006 --> 00:15:19,706
controllers off the

299
00:15:19,706 --> 00:15:22,326
at some point you have

300
00:15:22,486 --> 00:15:24,336
your root view controller

301
00:15:25,586 --> 00:15:27,196
Now when there's only

302
00:15:27,196 --> 00:15:30,856
on the stack the next Menu

303
00:15:30,856 --> 00:15:33,376
and bounces you back to

304
00:15:35,096 --> 00:15:38,366
Most games by comparison

305
00:15:38,796 --> 00:15:41,576
they typically have custom

306
00:15:41,766 --> 00:15:42,476
in UIKit.

307
00:15:43,246 --> 00:15:45,766
And they also typically

308
00:15:45,766 --> 00:15:47,586
between the different

309
00:15:47,806 --> 00:15:50,306
that also aren't

310
00:15:52,176 --> 00:15:55,296
And so for this reason

311
00:15:55,296 --> 00:15:56,956
with only having

312
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,016
the root view controller,

313
00:15:58,016 --> 00:15:59,706
for the entire duration

314
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:01,996
But by the rule that we just saw

315
00:16:02,286 --> 00:16:04,696
because there's only one

316
00:16:04,696 --> 00:16:06,036
at all points of your game

317
00:16:06,386 --> 00:16:09,056
by default pressing the Menu

318
00:16:09,056 --> 00:16:10,326
to the Apple TV Home Screen.

319
00:16:10,926 --> 00:16:13,586
So you're going to need some

320
00:16:13,856 --> 00:16:16,646
when you want Menu button

321
00:16:16,646 --> 00:16:18,946
to the Apple TV Home

322
00:16:21,066 --> 00:16:23,000
Enter GCEventViewController.

323
00:16:28,116 --> 00:16:31,816
This is a special view

324
00:16:31,816 --> 00:16:34,166
or rather for game

325
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:35,696
that have a single-view

326
00:16:37,076 --> 00:16:41,116
So if your game is one of these

327
00:16:41,196 --> 00:16:42,536
as your root view controller.

328
00:16:43,426 --> 00:16:46,686
Now this view controller

329
00:16:46,686 --> 00:16:49,866
controllerUserInteractionEnabled

330
00:16:49,866 --> 00:16:52,936
that you have for controlling

331
00:16:52,936 --> 00:16:54,806
to the home screen for

332
00:16:56,796 --> 00:16:59,526
When this value is false this

333
00:16:59,566 --> 00:17:02,536
traps the Menu button presses

334
00:16:59,566 --> 00:17:02,536
traps the Menu button presses

335
00:17:02,536 --> 00:17:03,636
up the responder chain,

336
00:17:03,966 --> 00:17:05,526
effectively keeping

337
00:17:07,806 --> 00:17:09,076
Incidentally, this is also

338
00:17:09,076 --> 00:17:11,106
where your controller

339
00:17:11,205 --> 00:17:12,536
and I'll get to that

340
00:17:13,726 --> 00:17:14,846
Now when this value is set

341
00:17:14,846 --> 00:17:19,546
to true Menu button events

342
00:17:19,546 --> 00:17:23,675
up the responder chain as

343
00:17:23,715 --> 00:17:25,185
to be minimized and

344
00:17:25,185 --> 00:17:26,386
to the Apple TV Home Screen.

345
00:17:27,486 --> 00:17:30,576
So your job as a game

346
00:17:30,576 --> 00:17:32,456
of

347
00:17:32,726 --> 00:17:34,116
as a user goes back and forth

348
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:35,446
between different

349
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:37,706
Let me show you with

350
00:17:38,176 --> 00:17:39,926
So here we are at the

351
00:17:39,926 --> 00:17:40,826
and we launch our app.

352
00:17:41,576 --> 00:17:43,226
Some games have a splash screen

353
00:17:43,226 --> 00:17:45,076
or some other introductory

354
00:17:45,346 --> 00:17:47,816
and many games will

355
00:17:48,016 --> 00:17:49,726
on an in-game main

356
00:17:50,446 --> 00:17:53,486
And for both of these

357
00:17:53,486 --> 00:17:55,756
that when they press the Menu

358
00:17:55,806 --> 00:17:57,506
to the Apple TV Home

359
00:17:58,306 --> 00:17:58,826
Therefore,

360
00:17:58,906 --> 00:18:00,776
set

361
00:17:58,906 --> 00:18:00,776
set

362
00:18:00,776 --> 00:18:01,916
to true.

363
00:18:02,476 --> 00:18:04,776
Now when the user progresses

364
00:18:05,016 --> 00:18:07,296
say active gameplay

365
00:18:07,896 --> 00:18:09,346
the user's expectations is

366
00:18:09,346 --> 00:18:12,156
that Menu button presses

367
00:18:12,266 --> 00:18:13,386
to the Apple TV Home Screen.

368
00:18:13,736 --> 00:18:16,616
So in these cases set

369
00:18:16,616 --> 00:18:17,106
to false.

370
00:18:18,086 --> 00:18:19,986
And if a user transitions back

371
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:21,796
to the in-game main

372
00:18:21,796 --> 00:18:23,196
to set this back to true again.

373
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:28,096
So that covers our first

374
00:18:28,136 --> 00:18:29,696
to the Apple TV Home

375
00:18:30,296 --> 00:18:32,156
And we still have the

376
00:18:32,156 --> 00:18:35,856
We need to worry about going

377
00:18:35,856 --> 00:18:37,206
and resuming active gameplay.

378
00:18:37,586 --> 00:18:40,086
Basically all the dark

379
00:18:41,186 --> 00:18:43,236
And the good news is that

380
00:18:43,236 --> 00:18:44,866
in the controllerPausedHandler.

381
00:18:45,426 --> 00:18:50,096
The controllerPausedHandler is

382
00:18:50,846 --> 00:18:54,066
to the controller or for

383
00:18:54,446 --> 00:18:56,676
and this is code that runs

384
00:18:56,676 --> 00:18:58,566
pressed and you're not

385
00:18:58,566 --> 00:18:59,816
to the Apple TV Home Screen.

386
00:19:00,796 --> 00:19:04,056
And it's a simple matter within

387
00:19:04,516 --> 00:19:06,596
if you're in a submenu go back

388
00:19:06,596 --> 00:19:08,936
to the previous level

389
00:19:09,626 --> 00:19:12,326
If you're in active gameplay

390
00:19:13,216 --> 00:19:15,236
And that's it now

391
00:19:15,236 --> 00:19:18,246
up to properly handle Menu

392
00:19:18,246 --> 00:19:19,346
of where you are in your game.

393
00:19:25,126 --> 00:19:27,486
So now let's talk about

394
00:19:28,366 --> 00:19:30,836
Some games can really take

395
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:34,226
of controls offered by

396
00:19:34,656 --> 00:19:36,126
and these are optional

397
00:19:36,126 --> 00:19:36,916
that players may have.

398
00:19:38,086 --> 00:19:40,256
Now by extended what

399
00:19:40,256 --> 00:19:42,736
to is the control

400
00:19:42,736 --> 00:19:44,366
that you're probably

401
00:19:44,936 --> 00:19:48,896
It features a DPAD on the left,

402
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:51,766
B, X, Y in these

403
00:19:52,176 --> 00:19:53,646
the diamond pattern

404
00:19:54,506 --> 00:19:57,136
On the front of the controller

405
00:19:57,656 --> 00:20:00,126
and on top we have two

406
00:19:57,656 --> 00:20:00,126
and on top we have two

407
00:20:01,186 --> 00:20:02,926
Now all of these buttons

408
00:20:02,926 --> 00:20:06,746
so far are pressure-sensitive

409
00:20:07,696 --> 00:20:10,686
We also have a Menu button,

410
00:20:11,046 --> 00:20:13,186
and we have four

411
00:20:13,916 --> 00:20:19,026
Now just like the Siri Remote

412
00:20:20,476 --> 00:20:22,426
extended game controllers

413
00:20:22,426 --> 00:20:24,526
GCExtendedGamepad profile.

414
00:20:25,126 --> 00:20:27,926
And you'll notice on the left

415
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:28,586
the properties.

416
00:20:29,556 --> 00:20:32,906
Also notice the data types

417
00:20:32,986 --> 00:20:34,826
and GCControllerButtonInput.

418
00:20:35,326 --> 00:20:36,826
These are the same

419
00:20:36,826 --> 00:20:37,926
to on the Siri Remote.

420
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:41,656
Now one thing I'd like to

421
00:20:41,776 --> 00:20:44,116
and the buttons and

422
00:20:44,116 --> 00:20:46,846
on this table actually

423
00:20:47,366 --> 00:20:49,256
So even those buttons and inputs

424
00:20:49,256 --> 00:20:51,266
that are typically

425
00:20:51,266 --> 00:20:54,466
in other controllers that

426
00:20:54,656 --> 00:20:56,466
like the DPAD and

427
00:20:56,466 --> 00:20:59,356
and shoulder buttons they're

428
00:20:59,526 --> 00:21:02,486
and so they can be read in an

429
00:20:59,526 --> 00:21:02,486
and so they can be read in an

430
00:21:03,746 --> 00:21:06,606
So let's look at code that shows

431
00:21:07,286 --> 00:21:09,866
Here we have the A button and

432
00:21:09,866 --> 00:21:11,646
to access the digital state

433
00:21:11,646 --> 00:21:13,446
of the button whether

434
00:21:13,816 --> 00:21:16,676
So if your game only concerns

435
00:21:16,676 --> 00:21:19,176
with whether or not a button is

436
00:21:19,176 --> 00:21:19,536
to use.

437
00:21:21,176 --> 00:21:24,206
However, if you care about

438
00:21:24,906 --> 00:21:26,556
that's when you'd use

439
00:21:27,296 --> 00:21:29,956
And this is great to add more

440
00:21:30,486 --> 00:21:32,906
Maybe you're creating a

441
00:21:32,906 --> 00:21:35,416
to allow players to vary

442
00:21:35,416 --> 00:21:39,476
from a soft gentle pass to a

443
00:21:39,476 --> 00:21:42,146
that by reading how hard

444
00:21:42,146 --> 00:21:43,016
with the value property.

445
00:21:43,816 --> 00:21:47,876
We also offer event

446
00:21:48,356 --> 00:21:50,406
Now notice there's a

447
00:21:50,406 --> 00:21:52,306
which corresponds to

448
00:21:52,596 --> 00:21:54,126
This is for Boolean

449
00:21:54,126 --> 00:21:55,316
or digital state changes.

450
00:21:55,846 --> 00:21:58,206
And there's a value changed

451
00:21:58,206 --> 00:22:02,396
to the value or sorry, a value

452
00:21:58,206 --> 00:22:02,396
to the value or sorry, a value

453
00:22:02,396 --> 00:22:03,456
with the value property.

454
00:22:04,686 --> 00:22:07,966
Now the value change

455
00:22:07,966 --> 00:22:10,836
in a typical button press

456
00:22:10,836 --> 00:22:13,266
down through its travel

457
00:22:14,436 --> 00:22:16,536
And for those of you looking

458
00:22:16,536 --> 00:22:19,846
to use polling or event

459
00:22:19,846 --> 00:22:22,626
and fast rules, but

460
00:22:23,026 --> 00:22:25,756
for reading those

461
00:22:25,756 --> 00:22:27,406
over a longer period of time.

462
00:22:27,806 --> 00:22:30,856
Like maybe the accelerator

463
00:22:30,856 --> 00:22:34,076
to the trigger of a button

464
00:22:34,076 --> 00:22:34,926
of the game controller.

465
00:22:35,506 --> 00:22:39,786
And event callbacks

466
00:22:40,416 --> 00:22:42,876
when you're concerned about

467
00:22:43,216 --> 00:22:44,726
So maybe you have

468
00:22:44,726 --> 00:22:47,626
and a player swings

469
00:22:47,626 --> 00:22:50,316
to activate the swing sword

470
00:22:50,316 --> 00:22:50,886
is pressed.

471
00:22:51,226 --> 00:22:53,746
Event callbacks are

472
00:22:55,256 --> 00:22:58,876
So by this point you

473
00:22:58,876 --> 00:23:03,566
of the mechanics of

474
00:22:58,876 --> 00:23:03,566
of the mechanics of

475
00:23:03,566 --> 00:23:05,446
from the Siri Remote

476
00:23:06,316 --> 00:23:07,596
and you're probably

477
00:23:07,596 --> 00:23:09,996
about which control types

478
00:23:10,836 --> 00:23:12,406
Will it support just

479
00:23:12,616 --> 00:23:17,416
or will it support the Siri

480
00:23:19,616 --> 00:23:20,976
Or as you heard on Monday,

481
00:23:21,826 --> 00:23:23,816
games that have advanced

482
00:23:24,276 --> 00:23:25,406
that can't be supported

483
00:23:25,406 --> 00:23:29,000
by the Siri Remote can require

484
00:23:39,146 --> 00:23:40,476
Now how you specify

485
00:23:40,476 --> 00:23:44,096
which controller types your

486
00:23:44,846 --> 00:23:48,696
In your target settings

487
00:23:49,296 --> 00:23:51,506
and in there you'll find the

488
00:23:51,946 --> 00:23:55,176
Enable this capability

489
00:23:55,176 --> 00:23:56,866
of controllers your

490
00:23:58,026 --> 00:24:01,696
Interacting with this GUI

491
00:23:58,026 --> 00:24:01,696
Interacting with this GUI

492
00:24:01,776 --> 00:24:04,206
in your info.plist

493
00:24:04,796 --> 00:24:08,816
And this is important for

494
00:24:08,816 --> 00:24:11,956
that link the Game Controller

495
00:24:12,416 --> 00:24:16,056
or rather these keys are going

496
00:24:16,056 --> 00:24:18,146
by all games that link the

497
00:24:18,866 --> 00:24:21,906
And where this really

498
00:24:22,266 --> 00:24:25,956
because your users are going

499
00:24:26,046 --> 00:24:28,776
if your game has game

500
00:24:28,986 --> 00:24:30,556
or game controllers as required.

501
00:24:31,356 --> 00:24:35,496
Additionally, the user may

502
00:24:35,496 --> 00:24:37,896
to download a game

503
00:24:39,916 --> 00:24:41,806
when they haven't

504
00:24:41,806 --> 00:24:43,096
to that Apple TV before.

505
00:24:44,536 --> 00:24:46,566
Now note that this

506
00:24:47,346 --> 00:24:49,766
because it's very

507
00:24:49,996 --> 00:24:52,926
that requires game

508
00:24:53,486 --> 00:24:55,526
and find no game

509
00:24:56,096 --> 00:24:59,766
And this is a case that you

510
00:25:01,096 --> 00:25:03,896
It's very possible that maybe

511
00:25:03,896 --> 00:25:04,886
on their game controller.

512
00:25:05,636 --> 00:25:08,866
So in this situation

513
00:25:09,306 --> 00:25:11,376
that no game controllers

514
00:25:11,446 --> 00:25:12,786
and to connect a

515
00:25:14,976 --> 00:25:17,446
Otherwise, the user may be

516
00:25:17,446 --> 00:25:18,866
seemingly not controllable.

517
00:25:19,526 --> 00:25:22,776
Now there's one other

518
00:25:22,776 --> 00:25:25,326
with notifying the user in

519
00:25:25,326 --> 00:25:26,696
on controller disconnections.

520
00:25:27,126 --> 00:25:29,226
This is because the controller

521
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:32,606
or rather the controllers

522
00:25:32,606 --> 00:25:34,356
check, but then somewhere

523
00:25:34,356 --> 00:25:36,446
down the line while

524
00:25:36,446 --> 00:25:38,216
of the game controllers

525
00:25:38,556 --> 00:25:40,116
And if this is the

526
00:25:40,116 --> 00:25:43,376
that was available then at this

527
00:25:43,376 --> 00:25:44,856
since it requires

528
00:25:44,916 --> 00:25:47,000
and again a place

529
00:25:53,046 --> 00:25:56,426
For more information,

530
00:25:56,656 --> 00:26:00,000
session 802 for more information

531
00:26:07,046 --> 00:26:08,536
So let's talk about

532
00:26:08,716 --> 00:26:09,976
the Apple TV Remote app.

533
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:14,366
As you heard on Monday, this

534
00:26:14,366 --> 00:26:16,706
in beta form on

535
00:26:17,856 --> 00:26:20,246
This app allows you to

536
00:26:20,666 --> 00:26:22,886
and it features a large

537
00:26:22,886 --> 00:26:26,666
of the screen and on-screen

538
00:26:26,666 --> 00:26:27,906
as well on the Siri Remote.

539
00:26:28,416 --> 00:26:32,196
And importantly for our

540
00:26:32,196 --> 00:26:33,396
as a game input device.

541
00:26:33,946 --> 00:26:38,966
And the way that's done

542
00:26:39,646 --> 00:26:41,616
by the Game Controller

543
00:26:41,616 --> 00:26:42,866
in a very familiar manner.

544
00:26:43,406 --> 00:26:45,676
It's effectively an

545
00:26:46,396 --> 00:26:48,906
So it shows up as a

546
00:26:50,006 --> 00:26:52,366
and it supports the

547
00:26:52,366 --> 00:26:55,146
and GCMotion profiles

548
00:26:56,046 --> 00:26:57,856
In fact, it's indistinguishable

549
00:26:58,106 --> 00:27:00,766
in the Game Controller

550
00:26:58,106 --> 00:27:00,766
in the Game Controller

551
00:27:01,306 --> 00:27:06,226
So the code you write for the

552
00:27:07,686 --> 00:27:12,336
Now by default these

553
00:27:12,886 --> 00:27:16,906
so if you have a Siri Remote and

554
00:27:16,906 --> 00:27:19,236
as one game controller

555
00:27:19,426 --> 00:27:20,536
in your controllers array.

556
00:27:21,646 --> 00:27:24,396
This means that button inputs

557
00:27:24,396 --> 00:27:26,626
to your game as if they

558
00:27:27,466 --> 00:27:29,326
and the same thing

559
00:27:30,476 --> 00:27:33,816
Now for motion we didn't want

560
00:27:34,066 --> 00:27:36,436
overwriting and fighting with

561
00:27:36,706 --> 00:27:39,336
so we take motion from

562
00:27:39,336 --> 00:27:40,826
from one remote at a time.

563
00:27:41,346 --> 00:27:45,026
And the remote we take

564
00:27:45,026 --> 00:27:48,246
that last received intentional

565
00:27:48,246 --> 00:27:50,826
on the touch surface or

566
00:27:52,126 --> 00:27:55,806
Now if you want you can opt-in

567
00:27:55,806 --> 00:27:58,176
and have them show up

568
00:27:58,176 --> 00:27:59,506
in your controllers array.

569
00:28:00,326 --> 00:28:03,856
To do this, go to

570
00:28:03,986 --> 00:28:08,016
and add the Boolean key

571
00:28:08,416 --> 00:28:11,546
set this to yes and

572
00:28:11,546 --> 00:28:13,756
and Apple TV Remote

573
00:28:13,756 --> 00:28:17,906
up as distinct controller

574
00:28:17,906 --> 00:28:25,316
Now I want to talk to you

575
00:28:25,316 --> 00:28:28,226
of the Apple TV Remote app

576
00:28:28,636 --> 00:28:31,936
This is a mode that users can

577
00:28:32,206 --> 00:28:34,726
in any game that links the

578
00:28:35,426 --> 00:28:41,876
Now this app is in landscape

579
00:28:41,906 --> 00:28:43,716
the DPAD values are rotated

580
00:28:43,716 --> 00:28:46,516
by 90 degrees before they

581
00:28:47,276 --> 00:28:49,866
So your app doesn't

582
00:28:50,006 --> 00:28:51,666
to take advantage of this mode.

583
00:28:53,146 --> 00:28:56,146
However, just note that if

584
00:28:56,146 --> 00:28:58,956
values by 90 degrees

585
00:28:58,956 --> 00:29:00,456
to be doing a double rotation.

586
00:28:58,956 --> 00:29:00,456
to be doing a double rotation.

587
00:29:01,316 --> 00:29:04,746
So our recommendation is if

588
00:29:04,746 --> 00:29:07,376
to allow players to play

589
00:29:07,596 --> 00:29:10,226
with the Siri Remote

590
00:29:10,226 --> 00:29:14,396
on the Apple TV Remote app

591
00:29:14,396 --> 00:29:18,176
like we saw previously

592
00:29:18,176 --> 00:29:20,856
to handle the orientation

593
00:29:21,706 --> 00:29:23,846
Now one more thing to note,

594
00:29:24,266 --> 00:29:27,876
the Apple TV Remote app's Game

595
00:29:27,876 --> 00:29:29,806
touch surface from the A button.

596
00:29:30,356 --> 00:29:33,476
This is different

597
00:29:33,846 --> 00:29:37,056
where clicking the touch surface

598
00:29:37,926 --> 00:29:41,586
Now mechanically this doesn't

599
00:29:41,586 --> 00:29:44,156
can still simultaneously

600
00:29:44,376 --> 00:29:46,046
and your game code

601
00:29:46,046 --> 00:29:47,716
for simultaneous input on both.

602
00:29:48,576 --> 00:29:51,946
But the key point is if you

603
00:29:51,946 --> 00:29:55,606
that all A button presses will

604
00:29:55,876 --> 00:29:58,886
this won't work in the same

605
00:29:58,886 --> 00:30:00,000
for the Apple TV Remote app.

606
00:30:11,166 --> 00:30:14,206
And lastly, I'd like to talk to

607
00:30:14,206 --> 00:30:16,736
We get asked all the time how

608
00:30:16,736 --> 00:30:17,646
TV support.

609
00:30:18,686 --> 00:30:23,556
And the answer is one Siri

610
00:30:23,556 --> 00:30:28,086
up to four MFi game controllers

611
00:30:29,666 --> 00:30:31,706
Now we typically get

612
00:30:31,706 --> 00:30:35,696
of multiplayer gaming and

613
00:30:35,696 --> 00:30:38,986
to four MFi game controllers

614
00:30:38,986 --> 00:30:40,636
to be great for multiplayer

615
00:30:42,116 --> 00:30:44,896
But something that may not

616
00:30:44,896 --> 00:30:47,716
that this is very important for

617
00:30:48,336 --> 00:30:49,006
Let me explain.

618
00:30:50,046 --> 00:30:53,596
When your app launches you're

619
00:30:53,596 --> 00:30:58,246
to find only one Siri Remote

620
00:30:58,246 --> 00:31:00,386
to find a game controller

621
00:30:58,246 --> 00:31:00,386
to find a game controller

622
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:03,186
or maybe you'll find one of each

623
00:31:04,626 --> 00:31:06,646
or maybe you'll find

624
00:31:06,646 --> 00:31:09,026
multiple game controllers,

625
00:31:09,266 --> 00:31:10,206
You get the picture right?

626
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:13,856
So the key point here is on

627
00:31:13,856 --> 00:31:17,226
to receive inputs from

628
00:31:17,226 --> 00:31:18,436
for single-player games.

629
00:31:18,796 --> 00:31:21,276
And importantly, you

630
00:31:21,676 --> 00:31:24,036
which controller the

631
00:31:24,896 --> 00:31:26,116
So you can't just assume

632
00:31:26,406 --> 00:31:29,456
that the controller's

633
00:31:29,456 --> 00:31:30,506
that the player wants to use.

634
00:31:31,246 --> 00:31:32,866
So how should we handle this?

635
00:31:33,456 --> 00:31:35,656
Well the key realization here is

636
00:31:35,656 --> 00:31:38,256
that players can switch

637
00:31:38,856 --> 00:31:40,316
Maybe they launched your app,

638
00:31:41,146 --> 00:31:43,846
traverse through your

639
00:31:43,846 --> 00:31:47,026
into gameplay all with the

640
00:31:47,026 --> 00:31:48,236
to the MFi game controller

641
00:31:48,236 --> 00:31:50,426
to actually start

642
00:31:51,016 --> 00:31:58,726
And games that allow players

643
00:31:58,986 --> 00:32:01,696
between different

644
00:31:58,986 --> 00:32:01,696
between different

645
00:32:01,696 --> 00:32:04,916
to prompt the user with

646
00:32:05,366 --> 00:32:08,026
or without requiring the

647
00:32:08,026 --> 00:32:09,186
and reenter gameplay

648
00:32:09,186 --> 00:32:13,206
with a different controller will

649
00:32:13,206 --> 00:32:14,296
user experience.

650
00:32:15,376 --> 00:32:16,466
So how should we do this?

651
00:32:17,676 --> 00:32:20,596
Well one way to go about

652
00:32:20,596 --> 00:32:22,566
from all controllers

653
00:32:22,566 --> 00:32:23,686
for your single-player game.

654
00:32:24,846 --> 00:32:26,556
So if you have a character

655
00:32:26,556 --> 00:32:30,466
from the DPAD allow all

656
00:32:30,706 --> 00:32:32,966
allow their DPADs to control

657
00:32:34,156 --> 00:32:36,966
Similarly with buttons, if

658
00:32:36,966 --> 00:32:38,266
if your character jumps

659
00:32:38,906 --> 00:32:41,596
by pressing the A button

660
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:44,506
on all the connected controllers

661
00:32:45,686 --> 00:32:49,796
And if a controller

662
00:32:49,796 --> 00:32:52,476
of your gameplay you can

663
00:32:52,476 --> 00:32:54,626
that controller too

664
00:32:54,626 --> 00:32:55,676
to control your character.

665
00:32:57,376 --> 00:32:59,156
Now this is working

666
00:32:59,156 --> 00:33:03,456
to give the player a system here

667
00:32:59,156 --> 00:33:03,456
to give the player a system here

668
00:33:03,456 --> 00:33:05,396
to switch back and forth

669
00:33:05,546 --> 00:33:08,166
And this is effectively a

670
00:33:08,576 --> 00:33:10,316
where we're taking the

671
00:33:10,316 --> 00:33:12,116
and game controllers

672
00:33:12,116 --> 00:33:13,666
into our single-player

673
00:33:14,066 --> 00:33:18,336
But there's one edge case

674
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:19,386
about and that's motion.

675
00:33:19,766 --> 00:33:21,176
So let me explain

676
00:33:22,696 --> 00:33:25,276
If you have a game

677
00:33:25,276 --> 00:33:28,256
to control the attitude of

678
00:33:28,456 --> 00:33:31,886
with the Siri Remote

679
00:33:31,886 --> 00:33:34,726
that controlling the

680
00:33:34,726 --> 00:33:36,736
if the player is playing

681
00:33:36,946 --> 00:33:38,866
And that's perfectly fine

682
00:33:40,516 --> 00:33:43,896
The key concern here though is

683
00:33:43,926 --> 00:33:47,046
that controls the airplane

684
00:33:47,356 --> 00:33:50,286
to be overwritten by any motion

685
00:33:50,286 --> 00:33:53,066
from the Siri Remote when

686
00:33:53,626 --> 00:33:56,956
So in this case the code in your

687
00:33:56,956 --> 00:33:59,616
of the airplane should

688
00:33:59,616 --> 00:34:02,856
that information from

689
00:33:59,616 --> 00:34:02,856
that information from

690
00:34:03,526 --> 00:34:06,646
So then back to our example

691
00:34:06,646 --> 00:34:08,606
with my Siri Remote if I pick

692
00:34:08,606 --> 00:34:11,985
up my game controller any

693
00:34:11,985 --> 00:34:15,366
on that game controller whether

694
00:34:15,366 --> 00:34:19,516
or triggers or buttons will

695
00:34:19,516 --> 00:34:22,346
from the Siri Remote and

696
00:34:22,456 --> 00:34:26,056
to control the attitude of

697
00:34:26,056 --> 00:34:29,346
If I then pick up my Siri

698
00:34:29,636 --> 00:34:32,156
namely swipes across

699
00:34:32,156 --> 00:34:35,545
or X button presses will at

700
00:34:35,545 --> 00:34:38,795
to motion coming from the Siri

701
00:34:39,996 --> 00:34:43,516
In using this we have a control

702
00:34:43,516 --> 00:34:45,496
for players and allows

703
00:34:45,496 --> 00:34:46,766
as seamlessly as possible.

704
00:34:48,246 --> 00:34:52,755
Now I'd like to end

705
00:34:52,755 --> 00:34:54,196
that maybe these techniques

706
00:34:54,196 --> 00:34:57,216
that I've shown you here can

707
00:34:58,176 --> 00:35:01,736
or maybe they're a good starting

708
00:34:58,176 --> 00:35:01,736
or maybe they're a good starting

709
00:35:01,736 --> 00:35:04,716
and customize them to suit

710
00:35:05,646 --> 00:35:08,026
But in any case, I really

711
00:35:08,276 --> 00:35:12,246
to go beyond the mere mechanics

712
00:35:12,246 --> 00:35:15,186
and disconnecting and

713
00:35:15,946 --> 00:35:18,706
and really thoughtfully

714
00:35:18,706 --> 00:35:20,706
to integrate game

715
00:35:21,416 --> 00:35:23,516
Because when you get

716
00:35:23,516 --> 00:35:26,266
of the player game

717
00:35:26,716 --> 00:35:29,406
and it really allows them

718
00:35:29,406 --> 00:35:31,786
and enjoy the game experiences

719
00:35:31,856 --> 00:35:33,476
that you've worked

720
00:35:33,476 --> 00:35:35,616
And that's what games

721
00:35:38,646 --> 00:35:40,086
So we've talked about

722
00:35:40,476 --> 00:35:42,306
To summarize, we talked

723
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:45,806
about the Siri Remote how it

724
00:35:45,806 --> 00:35:48,226
profile in the GCMotion profile.

725
00:35:48,896 --> 00:35:51,506
I talked about DPAD

726
00:35:52,246 --> 00:35:54,876
I also talked about

727
00:35:54,876 --> 00:35:58,476
on Apple TV the expected

728
00:35:58,476 --> 00:35:59,686
on the context of your app.

729
00:36:00,556 --> 00:36:02,996
And how you can use the

730
00:36:03,106 --> 00:36:06,266
and control or pause handlers

731
00:36:07,716 --> 00:36:10,136
I also talked about

732
00:36:10,886 --> 00:36:13,666
that these use the

733
00:36:14,066 --> 00:36:16,026
that they introduce

734
00:36:16,916 --> 00:36:18,966
and that they can

735
00:36:18,966 --> 00:36:20,766
as a controller for your game.

736
00:36:21,336 --> 00:36:24,786
I also talked about

737
00:36:25,666 --> 00:36:28,256
and how that's an emulated Siri

738
00:36:28,256 --> 00:36:29,456
of the Game Controller

739
00:36:29,936 --> 00:36:31,636
And I talked about

740
00:36:31,636 --> 00:36:34,926
of the Apple TV Remote app

741
00:36:35,206 --> 00:36:38,376
so that your game

742
00:36:38,376 --> 00:36:40,106
for the Apple TV Remote app.

743
00:36:41,056 --> 00:36:42,876
And lastly, I finished

744
00:36:42,876 --> 00:36:45,486
about multiple controllers

745
00:36:45,486 --> 00:36:49,206
for multiplayer gaming, but it's

746
00:36:49,486 --> 00:36:50,666
for single-player gaming.

747
00:36:50,956 --> 00:36:55,236
Namely, allowing your players to

748
00:36:55,326 --> 00:36:59,566
as you can for your game.

749
00:36:59,646 --> 00:37:01,696
Here's the URL for this session.

750
00:36:59,646 --> 00:37:01,696
Here's the URL for this session.

751
00:37:01,796 --> 00:37:03,966
You can find the

752
00:37:03,966 --> 00:37:05,076
and code samples here.

753
00:37:05,456 --> 00:37:07,196
This is session 607.

754
00:37:08,616 --> 00:37:11,946
Related sessions include

755
00:37:12,256 --> 00:37:13,826
and Designing for tvOS.

756
00:37:14,366 --> 00:37:17,306
There's also a tvOS lab

757
00:37:18,666 --> 00:37:20,106
Thank you so much

758
00:37:20,356 --> 00:37:21,826
and have a wonderful
