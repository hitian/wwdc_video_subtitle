00:00:32,386 --> 00:00:34,336
&gt;&gt; Welcome to Introduction

4
00:00:34,636 --> 00:00:37,476
My name's Najla and I'm a

5
00:00:38,056 --> 00:00:41,006
Along with my colleague Rick

6
00:00:41,086 --> 00:00:43,236
through the essential

7
00:00:44,356 --> 00:00:47,546
So Xcode is a development

8
00:00:47,676 --> 00:00:53,086
for iOS, watchOS,

9
00:00:53,486 --> 00:00:57,326
It gives you the tools

10
00:00:57,326 --> 00:01:00,256
from designing your user

11
00:00:57,326 --> 00:01:00,256
from designing your user

12
00:01:00,706 --> 00:01:02,876
to testing and debugging

13
00:01:03,466 --> 00:01:08,546
to provisioning your app for

14
00:01:09,046 --> 00:01:10,906
So today we're going to take you

15
00:01:10,906 --> 00:01:12,446
through the most

16
00:01:12,446 --> 00:01:13,806
of Xcode by creating an app.

17
00:01:15,126 --> 00:01:17,776
You'll learn how to create

18
00:01:17,776 --> 00:01:21,786
in the simulator, how to test

19
00:01:23,176 --> 00:01:26,026
how to review your changes and

20
00:01:27,376 --> 00:01:29,806
and how to configure your

21
00:01:31,196 --> 00:01:34,426
Now, we want this session to

22
00:01:34,426 --> 00:01:37,596
to use Xcode and less

23
00:01:37,916 --> 00:01:40,186
so the app that we're going

24
00:01:40,186 --> 00:01:43,066
to be very simple, but

25
00:01:43,066 --> 00:01:44,246
of the demo app fool you.

26
00:01:44,246 --> 00:01:46,246
There's information in

27
00:01:46,636 --> 00:01:48,386
whether you're brand

28
00:01:48,386 --> 00:01:49,826
or an experienced developer.

29
00:01:50,406 --> 00:01:54,806
So the best way to learn

30
00:01:54,806 --> 00:01:56,796
so let's get started

31
00:01:57,856 --> 00:02:00,296
So what you see here is

32
00:01:57,856 --> 00:02:00,296
So what you see here is

33
00:02:00,756 --> 00:02:03,476
On the right, you can

34
00:02:04,026 --> 00:02:05,786
and on the left, you

35
00:02:06,826 --> 00:02:07,966
Let's create a new project.

36
00:02:09,246 --> 00:02:11,666
And when you create a

37
00:02:11,666 --> 00:02:13,936
you have a number of

38
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:15,976
and there are basically

39
00:02:15,976 --> 00:02:16,966
for your application.

40
00:02:18,066 --> 00:02:20,146
You can have, there

41
00:02:20,146 --> 00:02:25,896
for all four platforms --

42
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:29,736
Now, I'm going to choose the

43
00:02:30,386 --> 00:02:32,186
which is a single

44
00:02:32,266 --> 00:02:33,836
for the iOS platform.

45
00:02:34,436 --> 00:02:36,766
It's, it provides the code for,

46
00:02:36,846 --> 00:02:39,116
to support an iOS

47
00:02:41,656 --> 00:02:44,366
So let's name our project Hello,

48
00:02:44,586 --> 00:02:46,966
and if you have a

49
00:02:46,966 --> 00:02:48,816
you can add it here

50
00:02:50,236 --> 00:02:52,726
Now, your organization name is

51
00:02:52,726 --> 00:02:56,896
and your bundle identifier

52
00:02:57,006 --> 00:02:59,836
of your organization name

53
00:03:00,356 --> 00:03:03,396
It's a string that uniquely

54
00:03:03,986 --> 00:03:07,606
Now, when you create a

55
00:03:08,306 --> 00:03:11,106
you can choose between

56
00:03:11,106 --> 00:03:12,256
as your programming language.

57
00:03:12,826 --> 00:03:15,966
We're going to be using

58
00:03:15,966 --> 00:03:18,396
to be universal, meaning

59
00:03:18,396 --> 00:03:23,206
and support both

60
00:03:24,016 --> 00:03:25,926
So when you create

61
00:03:26,786 --> 00:03:28,966
there are different options

62
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:34,936
We're going to choose

63
00:03:35,326 --> 00:03:37,696
Now, let's save our project

64
00:03:38,236 --> 00:03:41,496
and I'm going to click

65
00:03:41,496 --> 00:03:43,566
so that our project will be

66
00:03:43,596 --> 00:03:45,076
under version control

67
00:03:51,556 --> 00:03:53,426
Awesome, so here's our project.

68
00:03:53,926 --> 00:03:56,626
I'm going to resize the window

69
00:03:58,386 --> 00:04:01,066
Now, this is called

70
00:03:58,386 --> 00:04:01,066
Now, this is called

71
00:04:02,046 --> 00:04:05,256
On the left is the

72
00:04:05,256 --> 00:04:06,956
of your files and resources.

73
00:04:06,956 --> 00:04:11,566
In the middle is the editor

74
00:04:11,706 --> 00:04:13,946
that you've, that you

75
00:04:15,056 --> 00:04:18,836
And on the right is the utility

76
00:04:18,836 --> 00:04:21,196
contextual information based

77
00:04:21,196 --> 00:04:22,906
in the navigator

78
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:26,066
Now, if you're brand

79
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:27,066
you're probably wondering,

80
00:04:27,456 --> 00:04:31,196
what does this app

81
00:04:31,346 --> 00:04:34,466
You can run your application

82
00:04:34,746 --> 00:04:36,066
at the top of the main window.

83
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:38,776
But before we do that,

84
00:04:38,776 --> 00:04:40,836
about what actually

85
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:45,166
So when you click Run,

86
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:52,696
to run here and where

87
00:04:53,306 --> 00:04:56,236
Now, in your project, you can

88
00:04:56,236 --> 00:04:59,546
or even multiple configurations

89
00:05:00,396 --> 00:05:03,036
A scheme is how you

90
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:05,616
and it also contains information

91
00:05:06,376 --> 00:05:09,216
For example, I could have

92
00:05:09,216 --> 00:05:12,176
and a Watch app, and in that

93
00:05:12,176 --> 00:05:17,406
to run my iOS app and one

94
00:05:17,576 --> 00:05:19,596
Currently, we only have

95
00:05:19,596 --> 00:05:21,786
It's called Hello, and

96
00:05:24,716 --> 00:05:28,166
Now, your run destination

97
00:05:28,486 --> 00:05:30,646
where you want your

98
00:05:30,646 --> 00:05:32,576
and in Xcode, you

99
00:05:33,046 --> 00:05:35,036
You can run your

100
00:05:35,436 --> 00:05:36,616
or you can run it on a device.

101
00:05:37,476 --> 00:05:39,856
A simulator simulates what

102
00:05:39,856 --> 00:05:43,096
like on a device, and this is

103
00:05:43,096 --> 00:05:45,546
iterative development and

104
00:05:45,546 --> 00:05:47,746
on how your app is

105
00:05:49,426 --> 00:05:52,786
Currently we have the iPhone

106
00:05:53,796 --> 00:05:57,046
so let's click the Run

107
00:05:57,046 --> 00:06:03,856
to run our scheme Hello on

108
00:05:57,046 --> 00:06:03,856
to run our scheme Hello on

109
00:06:03,886 --> 00:06:09,526
So our application is

110
00:06:09,886 --> 00:06:10,966
I said that we were going

111
00:06:10,966 --> 00:06:13,226
to choose the simplest

112
00:06:13,226 --> 00:06:16,566
and there's nothing here,

113
00:06:16,566 --> 00:06:18,166
to make it a little

114
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:21,096
I'm going to stop the simulator

115
00:06:21,096 --> 00:06:23,676
by clicking the Stop button

116
00:06:24,946 --> 00:06:27,566
So in Xcode, you can lay

117
00:06:27,566 --> 00:06:29,836
of your application in

118
00:06:31,876 --> 00:06:34,376
Now, since we created our

119
00:06:35,216 --> 00:06:37,046
we have a couple

120
00:06:37,606 --> 00:06:38,846
We have a launch

121
00:06:38,846 --> 00:06:39,846
and a main storyboard.

122
00:06:40,596 --> 00:06:44,156
Your launch screen storyboard

123
00:06:44,156 --> 00:06:46,476
for your launch screen, which is

124
00:06:46,686 --> 00:06:48,526
when you launch an

125
00:06:49,016 --> 00:06:51,616
And your main.storyboard

126
00:06:51,616 --> 00:06:52,826
for the rest of your

127
00:06:53,506 --> 00:06:55,706
So let's open main.storyboard.

128
00:06:56,286 --> 00:07:00,746
In the storyboard, you have

129
00:06:56,286 --> 00:07:00,746
In the storyboard, you have

130
00:07:00,746 --> 00:07:04,866
which is this white background,

131
00:07:04,866 --> 00:07:07,266
of your canvas, which

132
00:07:07,266 --> 00:07:09,536
and it represents one

133
00:07:10,926 --> 00:07:13,716
Now, for a feature, I want

134
00:07:13,716 --> 00:07:16,756
but I also want to be able

135
00:07:17,396 --> 00:07:19,146
so I'm going to implement

136
00:07:19,146 --> 00:07:21,216
that when tapped says

137
00:07:21,806 --> 00:07:27,796
So at the bottom of the utility

138
00:07:28,006 --> 00:07:30,466
such as the file library and

139
00:07:31,246 --> 00:07:34,316
Now, third icon from the left

140
00:07:34,846 --> 00:07:36,826
which contains all

141
00:07:36,826 --> 00:07:38,186
that you can add to your scene.

142
00:07:39,696 --> 00:07:42,126
You can view them as

143
00:07:42,126 --> 00:07:44,326
when you don't exactly know

144
00:07:44,326 --> 00:07:49,896
and you want more information,

145
00:07:50,476 --> 00:07:54,326
Now, I already know that I

146
00:07:54,616 --> 00:07:58,906
in my scene, so I can use

147
00:07:58,906 --> 00:08:01,786
of the utility area to

148
00:07:58,906 --> 00:08:01,786
of the utility area to

149
00:08:05,636 --> 00:08:08,006
Let's drag it into our scene,

150
00:08:08,486 --> 00:08:12,706
and guides appear to

151
00:08:13,546 --> 00:08:15,656
Now, earlier I mentioned

152
00:08:16,486 --> 00:08:22,786
so let's take a closer look at

153
00:08:23,456 --> 00:08:27,076
Now, the first two, the file

154
00:08:27,476 --> 00:08:29,056
they're available

155
00:08:29,486 --> 00:08:32,486
no matter what you have selected

156
00:08:33,206 --> 00:08:35,635
but since I have the buttons

157
00:08:36,285 --> 00:08:38,746
the rest of the inspectors

158
00:08:38,806 --> 00:08:39,556
about the button.

159
00:08:40,446 --> 00:08:44,656
For example, I can click on

160
00:08:45,426 --> 00:08:49,386
to get information about the

161
00:08:49,766 --> 00:08:52,346
such as the size,

162
00:08:53,456 --> 00:08:55,786
I can click on the size

163
00:08:56,586 --> 00:08:58,676
to see information about

164
00:08:58,676 --> 00:09:01,526
and the position in the scene.

165
00:08:58,676 --> 00:09:01,526
and the position in the scene.

166
00:09:02,576 --> 00:09:06,706
I'm going to change this

167
00:09:06,706 --> 00:09:09,446
and I can do this in the

168
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:13,076
but an easier way of doing

169
00:09:13,076 --> 00:09:16,526
on the button and just

170
00:09:19,536 --> 00:09:22,026
Great, so now we have

171
00:09:22,976 --> 00:09:25,636
Let's go back to the filter

172
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:32,966
I'm going to drag

173
00:09:32,966 --> 00:09:34,916
above the button

174
00:09:35,606 --> 00:09:40,216
And once again, I can go back

175
00:09:40,216 --> 00:09:42,616
or the size inspector to

176
00:09:42,686 --> 00:09:47,086
but I like it the way it

177
00:09:48,466 --> 00:09:51,526
One thing to note about our

178
00:09:51,526 --> 00:09:54,696
that we haven't specified how

179
00:09:54,696 --> 00:09:56,236
on the device that it's on.

180
00:09:57,676 --> 00:10:01,376
Currently, we're viewing our

181
00:09:57,676 --> 00:10:01,376
Currently, we're viewing our

182
00:10:01,376 --> 00:10:05,836
of the iPhone 6s simulator or

183
00:10:05,836 --> 00:10:07,626
I can change it to

184
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:10,116
such as the iPhone SE device.

185
00:10:11,076 --> 00:10:12,796
And here we can see

186
00:10:12,796 --> 00:10:14,786
and our button actually

187
00:10:14,786 --> 00:10:16,956
that we thought.

188
00:10:17,676 --> 00:10:19,306
So let's go back

189
00:10:19,356 --> 00:10:23,166
and we need to add some

190
00:10:23,836 --> 00:10:26,486
to set some rules for how the

191
00:10:27,036 --> 00:10:31,606
We can do this using

192
00:10:31,606 --> 00:10:33,106
at the bottom of

193
00:10:34,516 --> 00:10:37,246
So for our button, I want

194
00:10:37,246 --> 00:10:40,816
and vertically centered in the

195
00:10:40,816 --> 00:10:45,996
on the Align icon and set

196
00:10:46,076 --> 00:10:47,376
and vertically in container.

197
00:10:48,086 --> 00:10:53,116
Now we can see our

198
00:10:53,326 --> 00:10:57,716
Now for my label, I also want

199
00:10:57,716 --> 00:11:01,626
in the view, so I'm going

200
00:10:57,716 --> 00:11:01,626
in the view, so I'm going

201
00:11:01,716 --> 00:11:05,006
and check Horizontally

202
00:11:05,486 --> 00:11:07,656
Now, when we did that, the

203
00:11:07,656 --> 00:11:09,186
meaning that something

204
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:12,536
And at the top of the

205
00:11:12,856 --> 00:11:15,846
there's actually an arrow that

206
00:11:15,846 --> 00:11:16,796
about what went wrong.

207
00:11:17,336 --> 00:11:20,826
And here we can see that we

208
00:11:20,906 --> 00:11:21,566
for the label.

209
00:11:22,126 --> 00:11:27,346
Now, I don't actually care

210
00:11:27,346 --> 00:11:28,136
of this label is.

211
00:11:28,496 --> 00:11:30,496
I just always want it

212
00:11:31,956 --> 00:11:35,506
So what I can do is I can

213
00:11:36,186 --> 00:11:40,576
Oops, we didn't select

214
00:11:41,156 --> 00:11:44,406
So once your label is selected,

215
00:11:44,406 --> 00:11:48,426
and pin the bottom of the

216
00:11:49,056 --> 00:11:52,746
It's at our constraint,

217
00:11:52,746 --> 00:11:56,266
I'm going to rerun it

218
00:11:56,266 --> 00:11:58,426
if we have the behavior

219
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:05,766
So here's our user interface.

220
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:07,306
Looks pretty great.

221
00:12:07,896 --> 00:12:10,386
What were to happen if

222
00:12:11,436 --> 00:12:13,886
Well, with the simulator,

223
00:12:13,886 --> 00:12:18,616
by clicking on Hardware and

224
00:12:19,156 --> 00:12:22,116
Let's rotate left, and

225
00:12:23,306 --> 00:12:24,926
Now, the great thing

226
00:12:24,926 --> 00:12:27,256
that you can simulate a lot

227
00:12:27,696 --> 00:12:31,556
such as rotation, shaking,

228
00:12:32,676 --> 00:12:35,256
I'd recommend checking out

229
00:12:35,256 --> 00:12:37,516
around with it because it

230
00:12:37,516 --> 00:12:39,226
to do some quick testing

231
00:12:39,226 --> 00:12:40,026
to pull out your device.

232
00:12:40,976 --> 00:12:44,406
So now that our user

233
00:12:44,586 --> 00:12:48,336
we need to add some code so

234
00:12:48,336 --> 00:12:49,936
changes the label to say Hello.

235
00:12:51,556 --> 00:12:55,346
Let's stop our simulator

236
00:12:55,386 --> 00:12:56,826
about scenes and

237
00:12:57,856 --> 00:13:01,856
So every scene in a storyboard

238
00:12:57,856 --> 00:13:01,856
So every scene in a storyboard

239
00:13:01,856 --> 00:13:05,616
class, which contains code

240
00:13:07,106 --> 00:13:09,986
I only have one scene in our app

241
00:13:09,986 --> 00:13:12,446
and I only have one

242
00:13:12,506 --> 00:13:15,866
in our navigator, so I can infer

243
00:13:15,996 --> 00:13:18,836
that this scene is

244
00:13:18,836 --> 00:13:19,956
in view controller's Swift.

245
00:13:21,306 --> 00:13:24,106
But what if I had multiple

246
00:13:24,636 --> 00:13:26,396
and multiple view

247
00:13:26,776 --> 00:13:28,726
How would I know which

248
00:13:28,726 --> 00:13:29,986
which view controller file?

249
00:13:31,496 --> 00:13:35,416
Well, when you select a scene

250
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:38,056
on the identity inspector,

251
00:13:38,056 --> 00:13:39,286
to the attributes inspector.

252
00:13:39,886 --> 00:13:42,396
It actually lists which

253
00:13:43,076 --> 00:13:48,986
So now we know for sure where

254
00:13:49,826 --> 00:13:52,516
So I want to display

255
00:13:52,516 --> 00:13:56,446
and our view controller files

256
00:13:56,846 --> 00:13:59,696
by clicking on the

257
00:13:59,796 --> 00:14:01,076
at the top of the main window.

258
00:13:59,796 --> 00:14:01,076
at the top of the main window.

259
00:14:01,656 --> 00:14:06,756
It's looking a little

260
00:14:06,756 --> 00:14:08,126
to create a little bit of room

261
00:14:08,896 --> 00:14:15,676
by hiding the documents outline

262
00:14:15,676 --> 00:14:22,656
by hiding the utility area

263
00:14:23,216 --> 00:14:25,856
Now, one thing to note is

264
00:14:25,856 --> 00:14:28,866
of our editor, it's called the

265
00:14:28,866 --> 00:14:33,666
of useful information about the

266
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:35,696
about the files themselves.

267
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:39,486
Now, the great thing about

268
00:14:39,486 --> 00:14:42,416
that it actually knows

269
00:14:42,596 --> 00:14:44,876
which files are related to

270
00:14:44,876 --> 00:14:47,856
in the primary editor and

271
00:14:47,856 --> 00:14:48,816
in the assistant editor.

272
00:14:49,306 --> 00:14:52,396
For example, if we opened our

273
00:14:52,396 --> 00:14:54,726
in the primary editor,

274
00:14:54,726 --> 00:14:57,926
up the generated

275
00:14:58,546 --> 00:15:01,346
Now, another cool thing

276
00:14:58,546 --> 00:15:01,346
Now, another cool thing

277
00:15:01,346 --> 00:15:04,856
that it actually, you can

278
00:15:04,856 --> 00:15:08,396
that it's using by selecting

279
00:15:08,396 --> 00:15:11,046
of the jump bar and changing

280
00:15:11,636 --> 00:15:14,826
For example, you can change it

281
00:15:14,826 --> 00:15:18,226
up all of the files that inherit

282
00:15:18,966 --> 00:15:25,316
So let's go back to

283
00:15:26,316 --> 00:15:28,306
by using the back

284
00:15:28,986 --> 00:15:33,706
So we have our view

285
00:15:33,706 --> 00:15:34,766
and we have our storyboard.

286
00:15:35,116 --> 00:15:37,246
We need to create

287
00:15:37,246 --> 00:15:42,306
and our label in our class.

288
00:15:42,466 --> 00:15:48,076
Now, I can do this by selecting

289
00:15:48,466 --> 00:15:49,416
so I have it selected.

290
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:54,476
I'm going to Control drag from

291
00:15:55,136 --> 00:15:56,926
Now, I want this

292
00:15:57,296 --> 00:16:00,976
which means that I want

293
00:15:57,296 --> 00:16:00,976
which means that I want

294
00:16:01,186 --> 00:16:02,226
when I tap the button.

295
00:16:02,966 --> 00:16:05,296
And let's name it Say Hello.

296
00:16:05,846 --> 00:16:10,596
Let's do the same

297
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:14,736
I actually want this

298
00:16:15,116 --> 00:16:17,226
which means that it's a

299
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:21,326
and let's name it Hello Label.

300
00:16:22,096 --> 00:16:28,796
So now we have references

301
00:16:29,786 --> 00:16:31,876
We need to add some

302
00:16:32,056 --> 00:16:33,666
that actually manipulates

303
00:16:35,106 --> 00:16:37,836
Now, I think a label has a

304
00:16:38,226 --> 00:16:42,196
but I'm not exactly sure, so

305
00:16:42,196 --> 00:16:44,376
and Command Click in

306
00:16:45,466 --> 00:16:48,186
So we, when we created our

307
00:16:48,556 --> 00:16:51,006
it declared it as an instance

308
00:16:51,006 --> 00:16:55,436
I can Option Click on this

309
00:16:56,106 --> 00:16:59,316
to get a quick help description

310
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:00,886
and also its availability.

311
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:00,886
and also its availability.

312
00:17:01,486 --> 00:17:06,146
I can also Command Click on

313
00:17:06,185 --> 00:17:08,306
to the, to where it's declared.

314
00:17:09,906 --> 00:17:12,616
And if I just want to look

315
00:17:13,415 --> 00:17:18,326
I can navigate to Help

316
00:17:19,036 --> 00:17:20,996
and search for the class.

317
00:17:21,806 --> 00:17:26,086
So I'll search for UI label,

318
00:17:26,116 --> 00:17:29,626
overview, and all of the

319
00:17:30,546 --> 00:17:33,886
So here it says that a

320
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:38,316
so that's what we can use

321
00:17:38,866 --> 00:17:42,886
Let's close documentation

322
00:17:43,086 --> 00:17:46,566
to our view controller file

323
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:49,956
in the jump bar and

324
00:17:49,956 --> 00:17:53,596
So I want to manipulate

325
00:17:53,596 --> 00:17:57,226
so I'll start typing that,

326
00:17:57,226 --> 00:18:00,386
Xcode will provide suggestions

327
00:17:57,226 --> 00:18:00,386
Xcode will provide suggestions

328
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:02,636
This is Xcode's code completion.

329
00:18:03,786 --> 00:18:05,516
I can autocomplete

330
00:18:05,716 --> 00:18:10,176
and I want to access

331
00:18:10,366 --> 00:18:11,696
I can also autocomplete that.

332
00:18:13,136 --> 00:18:15,506
And let's set it equal

333
00:18:16,106 --> 00:18:18,646
So now we have some code.

334
00:18:19,186 --> 00:18:20,246
We have our references.

335
00:18:20,246 --> 00:18:21,556
Let's see if this

336
00:18:22,556 --> 00:18:24,816
by rerunning it in

337
00:18:30,436 --> 00:18:31,946
So our app is launching.

338
00:18:33,316 --> 00:18:35,916
Here's our button,

339
00:18:36,486 --> 00:18:37,726
Very exciting, right?

340
00:18:38,516 --> 00:18:42,386
[ Applause ]

341
00:18:42,886 --> 00:18:43,526
Yes [laughter].

342
00:18:43,726 --> 00:18:49,566
So now you know how to create

343
00:18:49,566 --> 00:18:52,916
how to add a simple feature, and

344
00:18:53,396 --> 00:18:56,736
But it's very likely that you'll

345
00:18:56,736 --> 00:18:59,566
on an existing project

346
00:18:59,566 --> 00:19:03,586
than our button and label, so

347
00:18:59,566 --> 00:19:03,586
than our button and label, so

348
00:19:03,856 --> 00:19:05,966
Now that Rick and

349
00:19:06,316 --> 00:19:08,136
we've been implementing

350
00:19:09,066 --> 00:19:12,466
so I'd like to invite Rick

351
00:19:12,466 --> 00:19:14,716
through the rest of Xcode's

352
00:19:17,516 --> 00:19:23,146
[ Applause ]

353
00:19:23,646 --> 00:19:24,286
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Najla.

354
00:19:24,536 --> 00:19:27,616
So for the past week, we've been

355
00:19:27,826 --> 00:19:30,036
We decided to write

356
00:19:30,036 --> 00:19:32,306
so we could see what earthquakes

357
00:19:33,236 --> 00:19:35,876
We're nearly done, and of

358
00:19:35,876 --> 00:19:37,526
so that we could make

359
00:19:37,786 --> 00:19:40,116
and I think we still have a

360
00:19:40,696 --> 00:19:42,586
Let's take a look and dive

361
00:19:42,586 --> 00:19:44,946
into Xcode's debugger

362
00:19:45,496 --> 00:19:48,226
So to start out with, we need

363
00:19:48,226 --> 00:19:50,116
to check our project

364
00:19:50,896 --> 00:19:52,336
Xcode supports the Git

365
00:19:52,336 --> 00:19:54,546
and Subversion source

366
00:19:54,986 --> 00:19:56,376
To check out our project,

367
00:19:56,826 --> 00:19:59,396
I can go to Xcode's

368
00:19:59,816 --> 00:20:01,626
and choose the Check

369
00:19:59,816 --> 00:20:01,626
and choose the Check

370
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:06,056
This gives me Xcode's check

371
00:20:06,056 --> 00:20:13,226
in the repository path, so

372
00:20:13,486 --> 00:20:16,006
and our project is

373
00:20:17,386 --> 00:20:18,146
I'll hit Next.

374
00:20:18,756 --> 00:20:20,086
Xcode will give me

375
00:20:20,086 --> 00:20:22,306
in my authentication

376
00:20:23,526 --> 00:20:30,066
Whoops. And now Xcode

377
00:20:30,066 --> 00:20:32,716
like to check it out, so our

378
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:35,456
I'll say Download, and

379
00:20:35,456 --> 00:20:37,476
out of source control and

380
00:20:37,916 --> 00:20:40,286
Now that we have a project

381
00:20:40,286 --> 00:20:42,496
that the source control menu

382
00:20:42,676 --> 00:20:43,966
We'll come back to

383
00:20:44,966 --> 00:20:48,316
So to start out with, let's

384
00:20:48,316 --> 00:20:50,776
We could browse through our

385
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:52,886
and try to manually

386
00:20:53,266 --> 00:20:54,536
but there are some better ways.

387
00:20:55,306 --> 00:20:58,046
At the top of the navigator

388
00:20:58,046 --> 00:20:59,236
of different navigators.

389
00:20:59,526 --> 00:21:01,156
These each give you

390
00:20:59,526 --> 00:21:01,156
These each give you

391
00:21:01,236 --> 00:21:02,866
onto the content

392
00:21:04,076 --> 00:21:07,436
One of these views is the find

393
00:21:07,476 --> 00:21:10,496
I can search textually through

394
00:21:10,876 --> 00:21:13,766
So for example, we know that

395
00:21:13,766 --> 00:21:18,236
with the word Test, so

396
00:21:18,236 --> 00:21:20,276
with the word Test.

397
00:21:20,866 --> 00:21:22,006
Just hit Return.

398
00:21:22,236 --> 00:21:25,566
And here Xcode has found every

399
00:21:25,876 --> 00:21:28,366
in my project, including

400
00:21:28,366 --> 00:21:29,696
and some comments

401
00:21:30,646 --> 00:21:33,446
So that's great, but let's do

402
00:21:33,796 --> 00:21:37,886
If I want to find just my test

403
00:21:37,886 --> 00:21:40,496
These are where my symbols, like

404
00:21:41,126 --> 00:21:43,356
Again, starting with

405
00:21:44,066 --> 00:21:46,636
and here it's found

406
00:21:46,636 --> 00:21:49,786
So the find navigator

407
00:21:49,786 --> 00:21:50,996
through the content

408
00:21:51,416 --> 00:21:52,966
but since we're specifically

409
00:21:52,966 --> 00:21:56,046
for our unit tests here, Xcode

410
00:21:56,546 --> 00:21:58,326
and that's the test navigator.

411
00:21:59,356 --> 00:22:00,636
In the test navigator,

412
00:21:59,356 --> 00:22:00,636
In the test navigator,

413
00:22:00,636 --> 00:22:03,996
Xcode automatically lists

414
00:22:04,146 --> 00:22:06,846
and performance test that Xcode

415
00:22:07,856 --> 00:22:10,536
Some of these are grayed

416
00:22:10,976 --> 00:22:13,026
and that's because those

417
00:22:13,026 --> 00:22:14,806
to run in my current scheme.

418
00:22:15,196 --> 00:22:18,166
I have a separate scheme for

419
00:22:19,256 --> 00:22:21,746
The rest of the tests are

420
00:22:21,746 --> 00:22:24,716
that when I perform the test

421
00:22:25,126 --> 00:22:26,536
so let's go ahead and try that.

422
00:22:27,326 --> 00:22:30,426
From the product menu, I

423
00:22:30,426 --> 00:22:32,036
as the other four

424
00:22:32,786 --> 00:22:34,746
Run will run my app

425
00:22:35,726 --> 00:22:37,266
Test will run my tests.

426
00:22:38,346 --> 00:22:40,186
Profile will run my

427
00:22:40,186 --> 00:22:41,796
so I can measure

428
00:22:42,296 --> 00:22:44,956
Analyze will run

429
00:22:44,956 --> 00:22:47,396
and help catch problems I

430
00:22:48,086 --> 00:22:51,046
And finally, the Archive action

431
00:22:51,246 --> 00:22:53,926
and put it in the archive that

432
00:22:53,986 --> 00:22:56,426
to my testers or to the

433
00:22:56,426 --> 00:22:58,476
for future crash

434
00:22:58,476 --> 00:22:59,296
or symbolication.

435
00:22:59,936 --> 00:23:01,026
This command will become enabled

436
00:22:59,936 --> 00:23:01,026
This command will become enabled

437
00:23:01,026 --> 00:23:04,296
in this menu once I select a

438
00:23:05,386 --> 00:23:08,516
I'm going to go ahead and select

439
00:23:08,676 --> 00:23:11,716
I want you to watch the activity

440
00:23:11,786 --> 00:23:13,746
because it'll tell you

441
00:23:14,556 --> 00:23:17,726
So I'll select Test, and you can

442
00:23:17,726 --> 00:23:20,656
and then it's going to build my

443
00:23:20,656 --> 00:23:23,126
but it looks like we

444
00:23:23,126 --> 00:23:28,216
When a compiler error

445
00:23:28,216 --> 00:23:30,286
up at the right-hand side

446
00:23:30,336 --> 00:23:31,426
showing that there was an issue,

447
00:23:31,876 --> 00:23:33,596
and Xcode automatically

448
00:23:33,596 --> 00:23:35,296
to the issue navigator

449
00:23:36,156 --> 00:23:38,486
This behavior, like

450
00:23:38,486 --> 00:23:40,976
to the navigator that shows

451
00:23:40,976 --> 00:23:43,586
is something you can

452
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:46,646
and as you learn to make it work

453
00:23:46,646 --> 00:23:48,766
to dive in and configure

454
00:23:49,586 --> 00:23:52,156
You can do that in Xcode's

455
00:23:52,756 --> 00:23:54,166
If you choose to edit behaviors,

456
00:23:54,436 --> 00:23:56,066
Xcode will give you

457
00:23:56,306 --> 00:23:58,246
that lets you configure all

458
00:23:58,246 --> 00:24:00,436
So when a build generates

459
00:23:58,246 --> 00:24:00,436
So when a build generates

460
00:24:00,976 --> 00:24:02,266
we show the issue navigator.

461
00:24:03,096 --> 00:24:05,266
When a test generates

462
00:24:05,266 --> 00:24:07,136
we show the test

463
00:24:07,536 --> 00:24:10,616
As you start to get comfortable

464
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:12,766
to make it work the way you

465
00:24:13,016 --> 00:24:14,656
I recommend checking

466
00:24:16,436 --> 00:24:19,746
So let's take a look at what our

467
00:24:19,946 --> 00:24:22,126
I'm going to go ahead and

468
00:24:22,126 --> 00:24:24,696
in the issue navigator,

469
00:24:24,736 --> 00:24:27,496
to our source code where the

470
00:24:28,716 --> 00:24:31,436
Xcode lists the error

471
00:24:31,436 --> 00:24:32,756
where it's occurred,

472
00:24:32,756 --> 00:24:35,876
like here my data source

473
00:24:35,876 --> 00:24:37,846
or a property named

474
00:24:38,576 --> 00:24:41,096
You know, I think we had

475
00:24:41,176 --> 00:24:43,546
and just yesterday we

476
00:24:43,806 --> 00:24:45,996
and I guess we forgot to

477
00:24:46,256 --> 00:24:48,436
so let's figure out how

478
00:24:48,436 --> 00:24:49,336
of this method is.

479
00:24:50,556 --> 00:24:53,256
To start tracking that down, I'm

480
00:24:53,256 --> 00:24:57,216
down and click on Data Source,

481
00:24:57,216 --> 00:24:58,706
where this variable is defined.

482
00:24:58,706 --> 00:25:00,316
So I can see that

483
00:24:58,706 --> 00:25:00,316
So I can see that

484
00:25:00,316 --> 00:25:01,876
as a quake data source

485
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:05,856
I'm then going to hold the

486
00:25:05,856 --> 00:25:08,616
on Quake Data Source, and this

487
00:25:08,616 --> 00:25:10,106
where quake data

488
00:25:10,826 --> 00:25:13,296
I could start scrolling

489
00:25:13,296 --> 00:25:15,436
for my property, but

490
00:25:15,976 --> 00:25:20,746
The jump bar at the top of the

491
00:25:20,746 --> 00:25:22,466
that Xcode has found

492
00:25:22,716 --> 00:25:24,096
in the order in which

493
00:25:24,096 --> 00:25:26,676
There are a couple extra

494
00:25:27,006 --> 00:25:30,166
If I hold the Command key when I

495
00:25:30,166 --> 00:25:31,866
down in alphabetical

496
00:25:31,866 --> 00:25:33,286
of in an order of appearance.

497
00:25:34,526 --> 00:25:36,996
Or I can simply type

498
00:25:36,996 --> 00:25:39,356
and Xcode will filter

499
00:25:39,736 --> 00:25:41,566
So it used to be

500
00:25:41,566 --> 00:25:43,146
Probably still has

501
00:25:43,536 --> 00:25:46,516
I'll type Quakes, and here are

502
00:25:46,516 --> 00:25:47,676
that include the word Quakes.

503
00:25:48,396 --> 00:25:49,726
One of these is orderedQuakes.

504
00:25:49,926 --> 00:25:51,666
I think that's the new

505
00:25:52,686 --> 00:25:54,696
This is actually a

506
00:25:54,946 --> 00:25:57,036
so you can find things

507
00:25:57,516 --> 00:26:01,726
If I simply type OQ, Xcode

508
00:25:57,516 --> 00:26:01,726
If I simply type OQ, Xcode

509
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:03,776
because the letters

510
00:26:03,776 --> 00:26:05,216
in this property

511
00:26:05,296 --> 00:26:08,486
One last thing I want

512
00:26:09,116 --> 00:26:10,606
You'll notice that I

513
00:26:10,606 --> 00:26:13,426
Here's a to-do item reminding me

514
00:26:13,826 --> 00:26:16,456
and I have a header dividing

515
00:26:16,456 --> 00:26:19,956
You can actually configure these

516
00:26:19,956 --> 00:26:24,566
in your source code like to-do:

517
00:26:24,846 --> 00:26:27,786
and that will let you organize

518
00:26:27,786 --> 00:26:30,046
you want to make it easy to

519
00:26:31,146 --> 00:26:32,966
All right, so let's

520
00:26:33,166 --> 00:26:35,626
I'll type OQ again and

521
00:26:36,166 --> 00:26:38,616
It's found it for me right

522
00:26:38,616 --> 00:26:39,946
and copy this method name.

523
00:26:40,626 --> 00:26:43,326
I'm going to use the back

524
00:26:43,366 --> 00:26:46,656
to my test file, and

525
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:48,496
and paste the new

526
00:26:48,806 --> 00:26:50,986
When I do that, I want you

527
00:26:50,986 --> 00:26:53,356
on the left-hand side of the

528
00:26:53,356 --> 00:26:56,606
in my issue navigator

529
00:26:56,606 --> 00:26:58,596
and both of those

530
00:26:58,876 --> 00:27:01,216
And that's because the issue

531
00:26:58,876 --> 00:27:01,216
And that's because the issue

532
00:27:01,216 --> 00:27:04,416
you're doing in real time, so we

533
00:27:04,606 --> 00:27:07,416
as you edit it without having

534
00:27:07,416 --> 00:27:10,246
to see whether things are right.

535
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:13,296
Okay, so we fixed

536
00:27:13,296 --> 00:27:14,996
Let's go ahead and

537
00:27:15,886 --> 00:27:18,856
When I do this, Xcode's going to

538
00:27:19,246 --> 00:27:21,886
and it's now preparing to run

539
00:27:22,086 --> 00:27:23,906
as you can see from the

540
00:27:24,956 --> 00:27:27,166
Looks like our tests are

541
00:27:27,166 --> 00:27:30,386
to the test navigator to see

542
00:27:30,386 --> 00:27:33,166
from the spinner here

543
00:27:33,166 --> 00:27:34,786
It looks like one of

544
00:27:35,186 --> 00:27:36,306
and this might take a while,

545
00:27:36,306 --> 00:27:38,996
so let's actually hit the Stop

546
00:27:40,106 --> 00:27:42,846
Performance tests are great

547
00:27:42,846 --> 00:27:45,516
to iterate on fixing my unit

548
00:27:45,516 --> 00:27:47,416
to wait for my performance

549
00:27:47,976 --> 00:27:50,376
So we can do that by

550
00:27:50,376 --> 00:27:52,226
that doesn't run my

551
00:27:53,516 --> 00:27:56,006
To configure my scheme, I'm

552
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:57,646
and choose Edit Scheme.

553
00:27:58,876 --> 00:28:01,406
Here Xcode will bring down

554
00:27:58,876 --> 00:28:01,406
Here Xcode will bring down

555
00:28:01,946 --> 00:28:04,456
You can see that there's a

556
00:28:04,456 --> 00:28:07,496
to each of the five scheme

557
00:28:07,496 --> 00:28:09,376
at the top that lets

558
00:28:09,376 --> 00:28:12,186
which targets this

559
00:28:12,186 --> 00:28:14,566
to perform the actions on the

560
00:28:16,046 --> 00:28:17,706
For an action like

561
00:28:17,706 --> 00:28:19,766
like what executable

562
00:28:19,766 --> 00:28:20,756
In this case, it's my app.

563
00:28:21,636 --> 00:28:23,006
What command line arguments

564
00:28:23,006 --> 00:28:24,846
and environment variables

565
00:28:25,666 --> 00:28:27,056
Even special diagnostics

566
00:28:27,056 --> 00:28:29,136
like Xcode's powerful

567
00:28:29,136 --> 00:28:30,746
that will help you

568
00:28:31,176 --> 00:28:35,086
Since these diagnostics are

569
00:28:35,306 --> 00:28:38,216
they won't have any effect on

570
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:40,136
for distribution, so

571
00:28:40,136 --> 00:28:41,976
about these diagnostics

572
00:28:41,976 --> 00:28:43,216
with what you submit

573
00:28:44,396 --> 00:28:47,116
I'm going to go to the Test

574
00:28:47,116 --> 00:28:49,416
where I've configured what

575
00:28:50,206 --> 00:28:52,536
Before I start changing that,

576
00:28:52,536 --> 00:28:54,456
that I often do when

577
00:28:54,646 --> 00:28:56,836
and that's to make

578
00:28:57,066 --> 00:28:58,616
and make the edits in the copy.

579
00:28:59,486 --> 00:29:01,006
That's because I still

580
00:28:59,486 --> 00:29:01,006
That's because I still

581
00:29:01,006 --> 00:29:03,006
around that knows how to

582
00:29:03,316 --> 00:29:05,016
because I do want to run

583
00:29:05,016 --> 00:29:06,676
I just want a different scheme

584
00:29:06,676 --> 00:29:08,556
that lets me run

585
00:29:09,546 --> 00:29:10,736
So to do that, I'm going

586
00:29:10,736 --> 00:29:12,526
to select the Duplicate

587
00:29:13,426 --> 00:29:15,606
Xcode will give me a chance to

588
00:29:15,646 --> 00:29:18,406
so we'll call it

589
00:29:19,506 --> 00:29:21,316
And now I can go

590
00:29:21,606 --> 00:29:22,866
find my performance tests,

591
00:29:23,196 --> 00:29:26,236
and uncheck the checkbox

592
00:29:26,506 --> 00:29:28,746
From here, you can

593
00:29:28,746 --> 00:29:31,016
on a per-test basis

594
00:29:31,016 --> 00:29:32,096
you have a test that's failing

595
00:29:32,096 --> 00:29:33,556
that you're not going

596
00:29:34,566 --> 00:29:37,146
All right, I think we're done

597
00:29:37,516 --> 00:29:39,236
but before I go back

598
00:29:39,376 --> 00:29:41,176
I want to show you one

599
00:29:41,176 --> 00:29:43,476
and that's how to

600
00:29:44,676 --> 00:29:46,416
The Manage Schemes

601
00:29:46,416 --> 00:29:49,556
of this sheet will bring you to

602
00:29:49,916 --> 00:29:51,786
and here we show

603
00:29:51,786 --> 00:29:53,286
that Xcode has found

604
00:29:54,406 --> 00:29:56,466
I'd like to especially

605
00:29:56,746 --> 00:29:58,706
to the shared checkbox

606
00:29:59,706 --> 00:30:02,456
If a scheme is shared,

607
00:29:59,706 --> 00:30:02,456
If a scheme is shared,

608
00:30:02,456 --> 00:30:06,066
that scheme into source control,

609
00:30:06,166 --> 00:30:08,286
that same scheme when they

610
00:30:08,786 --> 00:30:10,846
and any edits they or you make,

611
00:30:11,126 --> 00:30:13,446
assuming that you check those

612
00:30:13,866 --> 00:30:15,396
will be shared with

613
00:30:15,646 --> 00:30:18,406
so this makes it really easy to

614
00:30:18,406 --> 00:30:19,616
that you want everyone to use

615
00:30:19,816 --> 00:30:21,156
and share it with

616
00:30:22,706 --> 00:30:25,446
Since my coworkers might want

617
00:30:25,446 --> 00:30:27,846
without the performance tests

618
00:30:27,846 --> 00:30:28,856
and share my new scheme.

619
00:30:30,046 --> 00:30:32,646
Okay, I think we're done

620
00:30:32,976 --> 00:30:34,616
and run our tests one more time.

621
00:30:35,156 --> 00:30:40,016
It's preparing to run my

622
00:30:41,026 --> 00:30:43,436
attaching to my tests, and

623
00:30:43,676 --> 00:30:47,276
And you can see from the test

624
00:30:47,276 --> 00:30:49,966
of my tests have passed,

625
00:30:51,346 --> 00:30:53,116
If I want a closer look

626
00:30:53,306 --> 00:30:55,886
I can find that in

627
00:30:57,296 --> 00:31:00,976
The reports navigator shows

628
00:30:57,296 --> 00:31:00,976
The reports navigator shows

629
00:31:00,976 --> 00:31:04,126
that I performed grouped by

630
00:31:04,126 --> 00:31:05,076
to perform that action.

631
00:31:05,836 --> 00:31:09,376
So here I just perform a Build

632
00:31:09,376 --> 00:31:11,866
to test and then the

633
00:31:13,096 --> 00:31:15,376
If I select the Build log

634
00:31:15,376 --> 00:31:19,036
to show me everything, I can

635
00:31:19,036 --> 00:31:21,976
to build both my

636
00:31:22,856 --> 00:31:27,376
If I select the Test log, Xcode

637
00:31:27,906 --> 00:31:30,366
its status, and I

638
00:31:30,366 --> 00:31:32,746
down to find the

639
00:31:32,986 --> 00:31:34,786
In this case, one of my

640
00:31:34,786 --> 00:31:37,176
because an earthquake

641
00:31:38,796 --> 00:31:40,346
I'm going to hover

642
00:31:40,346 --> 00:31:42,146
and I'll get a little

643
00:31:42,856 --> 00:31:44,716
So if I select that,

644
00:31:44,716 --> 00:31:45,746
to the failing test.

645
00:31:46,936 --> 00:31:50,486
Here you can see where I declare

646
00:31:50,486 --> 00:31:52,356
to the left of the

647
00:31:52,356 --> 00:31:53,866
that that test is

648
00:31:55,016 --> 00:31:57,576
If I scroll down, I can find

649
00:31:58,306 --> 00:32:00,406
Here I have a test assertion

650
00:31:58,306 --> 00:32:00,406
Here I have a test assertion

651
00:32:00,406 --> 00:32:04,686
of my test data or earthquake

652
00:32:04,686 --> 00:32:06,686
like this range check

653
00:32:06,686 --> 00:32:08,236
Actually, this looks

654
00:32:08,236 --> 00:32:10,856
I think I just have a less than

655
00:32:10,856 --> 00:32:13,696
than because I'm trying to check

656
00:32:13,986 --> 00:32:15,466
so I think that should

657
00:32:16,856 --> 00:32:19,676
Let's go ahead and run this test

658
00:32:20,286 --> 00:32:22,946
but since I'm trying to iterate

659
00:32:23,216 --> 00:32:25,636
there's a faster way than

660
00:32:25,916 --> 00:32:27,566
I can run just this test.

661
00:32:28,506 --> 00:32:30,556
To do that, I can go

662
00:32:30,956 --> 00:32:32,566
and mouse over my test.

663
00:32:32,896 --> 00:32:35,276
You'll see that the badge

664
00:32:35,276 --> 00:32:38,056
when I do that that would

665
00:32:38,056 --> 00:32:40,406
or I can run just an

666
00:32:41,196 --> 00:32:43,336
or if I don't want to switch

667
00:32:43,576 --> 00:32:46,426
I can even run my test right

668
00:32:46,426 --> 00:32:48,536
by mousing over the

669
00:32:48,536 --> 00:32:51,336
of the test method and clicking

670
00:32:52,666 --> 00:32:53,676
So let's click that now.

671
00:32:54,206 --> 00:32:56,686
It's building my change to

672
00:32:56,686 --> 00:32:57,946
to run my tests again.

673
00:33:00,116 --> 00:33:02,246
So it's ran my tests

674
00:33:02,246 --> 00:33:04,936
like my test is still failing,

675
00:33:04,936 --> 00:33:08,836
I'm going to scroll

676
00:33:08,836 --> 00:33:11,746
of my earthquakes

677
00:33:11,746 --> 00:33:13,606
that graphically

678
00:33:13,916 --> 00:33:16,526
and for my test earthquake

679
00:33:16,526 --> 00:33:18,476
that every earthquake

680
00:33:18,476 --> 00:33:21,536
but one of them has a nil badge,

681
00:33:22,586 --> 00:33:24,786
This doesn't look like a

682
00:33:24,786 --> 00:33:26,796
It's probably a problem

683
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:29,226
up these earthquakes, so I'm

684
00:33:29,646 --> 00:33:31,396
and take a closer look

685
00:33:32,696 --> 00:33:34,536
We're showing you a

686
00:33:34,536 --> 00:33:35,906
around your code in Xcode today,

687
00:33:36,116 --> 00:33:38,816
but I'm about to show you the

688
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:39,746
gesture that we have.

689
00:33:41,186 --> 00:33:43,796
In Xcode's file menu,

690
00:33:44,186 --> 00:33:46,106
whoop -- called Open Quickly.

691
00:33:46,916 --> 00:33:48,846
This is one keyboard shortcut

692
00:33:48,846 --> 00:33:51,366
to memorize, Command

693
00:33:51,366 --> 00:33:52,606
to use this all the time.

694
00:33:53,686 --> 00:33:56,856
If I select Open Quickly, I

695
00:33:56,856 --> 00:34:00,806
of my window, and I can type in

696
00:33:56,856 --> 00:34:00,806
of my window, and I can type in

697
00:34:01,036 --> 00:34:04,366
like my method names, in

698
00:34:04,366 --> 00:34:08,025
as all the symbols in Apple's

699
00:34:08,025 --> 00:34:10,616
to find whatever I'm looking

700
00:34:10,846 --> 00:34:12,315
or in the system frameworks.

701
00:34:13,446 --> 00:34:15,926
This also is a nice, fuzzy

702
00:34:15,926 --> 00:34:18,186
to know exactly the name

703
00:34:18,565 --> 00:34:20,306
In this case, I think

704
00:34:20,306 --> 00:34:22,396
up in some method

705
00:34:22,696 --> 00:34:24,956
so let's try typing

706
00:34:25,545 --> 00:34:28,835
and you can see it's found my

707
00:34:29,235 --> 00:34:31,156
even though I didn't have

708
00:34:31,156 --> 00:34:34,196
because it's a fuzzy match,

709
00:34:34,196 --> 00:34:35,755
where this method

710
00:34:36,065 --> 00:34:38,036
but the first one that's

711
00:34:38,036 --> 00:34:39,716
up my test data, so

712
00:34:39,716 --> 00:34:43,636
So I'm just going to hit Return

713
00:34:44,076 --> 00:34:46,726
Okay, so here I'm setting

714
00:34:47,045 --> 00:34:50,126
I don't see anything obviously

715
00:34:50,126 --> 00:34:51,856
to take a closer look

716
00:34:52,196 --> 00:34:54,646
And to do that, I'm going

717
00:34:55,755 --> 00:34:58,546
Xcode's debugger is available

718
00:34:58,546 --> 00:35:00,236
or Test action in Xcode.

719
00:34:58,546 --> 00:35:00,236
or Test action in Xcode.

720
00:35:00,586 --> 00:35:03,666
And you can get it to stop

721
00:35:04,076 --> 00:35:05,966
by setting a break

722
00:35:06,526 --> 00:35:09,856
I can set a break point by

723
00:35:09,856 --> 00:35:11,226
of the editor, and you'll see

724
00:35:11,226 --> 00:35:13,136
that a break point

725
00:35:14,106 --> 00:35:15,946
I can click on that

726
00:35:15,946 --> 00:35:18,496
and temporarily disable it

727
00:35:18,906 --> 00:35:21,616
or I could just drag it out

728
00:35:21,616 --> 00:35:22,636
to delete my break point.

729
00:35:23,856 --> 00:35:25,856
In this case, I do want my

730
00:35:25,856 --> 00:35:28,586
to click again to create

731
00:35:28,586 --> 00:35:29,686
and run our test again.

732
00:35:29,686 --> 00:35:32,556
I'm going to show you one last

733
00:35:32,966 --> 00:35:35,146
There's a command in

734
00:35:35,146 --> 00:35:39,096
and Test Again will run whatever

735
00:35:39,446 --> 00:35:40,536
so it makes it really easy

736
00:35:40,536 --> 00:35:42,926
to repeatedly run the same

737
00:35:44,186 --> 00:35:46,486
I can get at Test Again

738
00:35:46,956 --> 00:35:48,806
under the Perform

739
00:35:48,806 --> 00:35:51,166
There's actually a number

740
00:35:51,246 --> 00:35:55,086
but here's Test Again, so

741
00:35:55,086 --> 00:35:57,396
Xcode's going to run

742
00:35:58,266 --> 00:36:00,106
It's attaching to my

743
00:35:58,266 --> 00:36:00,106
It's attaching to my

744
00:36:00,106 --> 00:36:02,976
starting to run my

745
00:36:02,976 --> 00:36:04,046
that Xcode has now stopped

746
00:36:04,046 --> 00:36:05,716
in the debugger on

747
00:36:06,866 --> 00:36:09,136
When the debugger stopped,

748
00:36:09,826 --> 00:36:13,466
First, at the bottom, the Debug

749
00:36:13,466 --> 00:36:15,806
of different controls to allow

750
00:36:16,026 --> 00:36:18,256
such as Continue, Step

751
00:36:19,756 --> 00:36:24,096
Below that is a variable area

752
00:36:24,096 --> 00:36:25,546
that are visible in

753
00:36:26,106 --> 00:36:28,186
Here I declare three

754
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:29,716
but I haven't assigned

755
00:36:29,926 --> 00:36:31,016
so it shows no value.

756
00:36:31,576 --> 00:36:34,646
On the right-hand

757
00:36:34,646 --> 00:36:38,026
that shows all the output my

758
00:36:38,026 --> 00:36:41,876
out or standard error, and we'll

759
00:36:42,206 --> 00:36:44,566
Finally, you'll notice

760
00:36:44,566 --> 00:36:47,066
in the debugger, one of

761
00:36:47,326 --> 00:36:50,026
and Xcode automatically switched

762
00:36:50,886 --> 00:36:52,356
Here Xcode shows

763
00:36:52,356 --> 00:36:53,746
in my code in every thread.

764
00:36:54,236 --> 00:36:57,376
This code is actually running on

765
00:36:57,376 --> 00:37:01,556
Thread 6, and all of my stack

766
00:36:57,376 --> 00:37:01,556
Thread 6, and all of my stack

767
00:37:01,556 --> 00:37:05,346
for are shown in black,

768
00:37:05,346 --> 00:37:08,456
that contain system code that

769
00:37:08,456 --> 00:37:11,116
and can't look at

770
00:37:12,026 --> 00:37:14,556
You'll notice that there's

771
00:37:14,556 --> 00:37:15,826
aligning some of these frames.

772
00:37:15,826 --> 00:37:18,906
It's because I don't really need

773
00:37:18,906 --> 00:37:21,266
that I don't have source code

774
00:37:21,266 --> 00:37:24,626
to see exactly what's happening,

775
00:37:24,626 --> 00:37:26,096
at the bottom of

776
00:37:27,776 --> 00:37:29,836
All right, let's try stepping

777
00:37:29,836 --> 00:37:32,276
where we initialized this first

778
00:37:32,276 --> 00:37:34,606
I'm going to use the Step

779
00:37:35,566 --> 00:37:37,876
When I do that, Xcode continues

780
00:37:38,206 --> 00:37:41,116
and you'll see that my first

781
00:37:41,116 --> 00:37:42,506
initialized in the

782
00:37:42,506 --> 00:37:46,816
I can actually twist this open

783
00:37:46,816 --> 00:37:50,596
of this new earthquake,

784
00:37:50,796 --> 00:37:53,026
Since this is an image and I

785
00:37:53,026 --> 00:37:55,246
at what this is, Xcode

786
00:37:55,246 --> 00:37:58,986
to quick look objects like

787
00:37:58,986 --> 00:38:01,646
Xcode will read the image right

788
00:37:58,986 --> 00:38:01,646
Xcode will read the image right

789
00:38:01,796 --> 00:38:03,356
and display it graphically here

790
00:38:03,356 --> 00:38:06,046
so you can inspect exactly what

791
00:38:07,446 --> 00:38:09,606
Well, this badge

792
00:38:09,606 --> 00:38:11,676
since this one isn't

793
00:38:11,676 --> 00:38:12,906
out the next earthquake.

794
00:38:13,256 --> 00:38:15,376
And to do that, I'm actually

795
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:17,156
of this next earthquake

796
00:38:18,116 --> 00:38:20,826
I use the Step Into

797
00:38:20,826 --> 00:38:21,776
into this initializer,

798
00:38:22,336 --> 00:38:25,236
and here's where we

799
00:38:25,236 --> 00:38:27,486
So I can just start stepping

800
00:38:28,716 --> 00:38:30,356
Here's the switch

801
00:38:30,356 --> 00:38:31,966
which magnitude badge to use.

802
00:38:32,376 --> 00:38:33,946
And here's the badge

803
00:38:34,246 --> 00:38:36,516
I don't think this

804
00:38:36,516 --> 00:38:40,146
I don't think IIII is

805
00:38:41,346 --> 00:38:45,406
So that's probably the problem,

806
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:47,166
stopping it, running

807
00:38:47,486 --> 00:38:50,096
but Xcode makes it possible to

808
00:38:50,096 --> 00:38:51,856
to stop and start

809
00:38:52,286 --> 00:38:54,726
And to do that, I'm going to

810
00:38:55,436 --> 00:39:00,036
In the console area, I'm

811
00:38:55,436 --> 00:39:00,036
In the console area, I'm

812
00:39:00,506 --> 00:39:02,036
which stands for Print Object,

813
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:04,906
and this command will

814
00:39:04,906 --> 00:39:07,236
or Objective-C expression

815
00:39:07,726 --> 00:39:10,256
So I can simply copy

816
00:39:10,846 --> 00:39:12,796
and paste it right

817
00:39:12,796 --> 00:39:15,146
So let's make this console

818
00:39:15,146 --> 00:39:17,436
and let's also clear

819
00:39:17,436 --> 00:39:19,166
with the Clear button so

820
00:39:20,486 --> 00:39:23,596
And now I'm going to hit Return

821
00:39:23,646 --> 00:39:26,876
in my application, and you can

822
00:39:26,876 --> 00:39:28,396
so there is no image

823
00:39:29,616 --> 00:39:31,926
I'm going to press the up arrow

824
00:39:32,386 --> 00:39:35,856
and let's try IV, which I think

825
00:39:35,856 --> 00:39:36,366
for 4.

826
00:39:37,106 --> 00:39:38,416
So I'll hit Return

827
00:39:38,416 --> 00:39:40,706
and you can see the

828
00:39:40,706 --> 00:39:42,076
in actual image instance,

829
00:39:42,256 --> 00:39:44,366
so it looks like that's the

830
00:39:44,366 --> 00:39:47,686
So at this point, I'm going to

831
00:39:48,496 --> 00:39:50,826
and I'll change my image to IV,

832
00:39:51,376 --> 00:39:54,866
and let's run our test one more

833
00:39:55,546 --> 00:39:58,976
So Xcode is building the

834
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:00,976
It's preparing to run my tests.

835
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:00,976
It's preparing to run my tests.

836
00:40:01,266 --> 00:40:02,456
Let's switch to the

837
00:40:02,456 --> 00:40:03,646
so I can see how it goes.

838
00:40:04,546 --> 00:40:07,786
And, oh, it looks like I

839
00:40:08,526 --> 00:40:10,746
So I want it to run my tests

840
00:40:10,746 --> 00:40:13,016
so let's take a look at how

841
00:40:14,406 --> 00:40:17,376
Xcode's break points navigator

842
00:40:17,376 --> 00:40:21,326
that I have set in my project,

843
00:40:21,326 --> 00:40:23,866
and I can disable them

844
00:40:24,236 --> 00:40:26,176
or select them and delete

845
00:40:27,026 --> 00:40:29,056
I can add special

846
00:40:29,056 --> 00:40:31,286
in the break point

847
00:40:31,286 --> 00:40:34,286
on any Swift error that's

848
00:40:34,286 --> 00:40:37,636
that fails, or on any symbolic

849
00:40:37,636 --> 00:40:41,586
If I find that there's a certain

850
00:40:41,586 --> 00:40:44,036
to have, like, say, a

851
00:40:44,436 --> 00:40:48,206
I can make it available in every

852
00:40:48,536 --> 00:40:50,676
by selecting the break

853
00:40:51,556 --> 00:40:53,146
bringing up the contextual menu,

854
00:40:53,646 --> 00:40:55,906
and choosing Move

855
00:40:57,006 --> 00:40:59,076
This moves that break point

856
00:40:59,276 --> 00:41:01,696
and makes it available for

857
00:40:59,276 --> 00:41:01,696
and makes it available for

858
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:02,196
working with.

859
00:41:03,956 --> 00:41:04,376
All right.

860
00:41:04,496 --> 00:41:06,156
In this case, I'm

861
00:41:06,156 --> 00:41:08,426
to delete all my break points

862
00:41:08,756 --> 00:41:10,816
so let's temporarily

863
00:41:10,816 --> 00:41:11,966
so that we don't stop at them.

864
00:41:12,536 --> 00:41:14,486
I can temporarily

865
00:41:14,696 --> 00:41:16,466
with the Break Points

866
00:41:18,016 --> 00:41:19,336
I'll now press the

867
00:41:19,336 --> 00:41:20,466
to finish running my test.

868
00:41:21,326 --> 00:41:23,876
Let's go back to the test

869
00:41:23,876 --> 00:41:26,356
that all my tests are passing,

870
00:41:27,456 --> 00:41:28,846
Let's review what

871
00:41:29,836 --> 00:41:31,496
To review my changes,

872
00:41:31,496 --> 00:41:34,366
to Xcode's project navigator

873
00:41:34,366 --> 00:41:36,866
at the bottom called the

874
00:41:38,036 --> 00:41:40,826
This will make the project

875
00:41:40,826 --> 00:41:42,936
files that have a special

876
00:41:43,176 --> 00:41:44,176
such as Modified.

877
00:41:45,156 --> 00:41:47,106
This both lets me see

878
00:41:47,316 --> 00:41:50,056
and is really useful if I

879
00:41:50,326 --> 00:41:52,036
a set of files I'm all

880
00:41:52,036 --> 00:41:53,036
to jump between quickly.

881
00:41:53,406 --> 00:41:56,346
If I modified those files, I

882
00:41:56,346 --> 00:41:57,936
down to just those

883
00:41:58,506 --> 00:42:01,806
If I want to see the actual

884
00:41:58,506 --> 00:42:01,806
If I want to see the actual

885
00:42:01,806 --> 00:42:03,096
of these files, I can select it

886
00:42:03,096 --> 00:42:05,356
and use Xcode's third

887
00:42:06,206 --> 00:42:08,076
So we've already shown

888
00:42:08,076 --> 00:42:09,146
and the assistant editor.

889
00:42:09,686 --> 00:42:11,906
Xcode's third editor mode

890
00:42:12,176 --> 00:42:14,216
and it has three variants.

891
00:42:15,076 --> 00:42:18,116
The comparison editor

892
00:42:18,116 --> 00:42:20,586
between two revisions or

893
00:42:20,586 --> 00:42:22,116
against the last

894
00:42:22,906 --> 00:42:26,256
The blame mode lets you see who

895
00:42:26,256 --> 00:42:27,716
in your file and

896
00:42:28,236 --> 00:42:30,966
and the log mode will show

897
00:42:30,966 --> 00:42:31,676
for your file.

898
00:42:32,906 --> 00:42:34,986
In this case, I want

899
00:42:36,426 --> 00:42:39,656
When I select this, Xcode shows

900
00:42:40,296 --> 00:42:42,326
On the left is my

901
00:42:42,386 --> 00:42:43,846
so these are the

902
00:42:44,446 --> 00:42:46,856
and on the right is the

903
00:42:46,856 --> 00:42:49,676
to source control, so this

904
00:42:49,716 --> 00:42:51,636
between what I've done and

905
00:42:52,136 --> 00:42:55,456
In the bottom middle are

906
00:42:55,456 --> 00:42:58,266
between my changes, and when

907
00:42:58,436 --> 00:43:01,266
Xcode will visually show me

908
00:42:58,436 --> 00:43:01,266
Xcode will visually show me

909
00:43:01,436 --> 00:43:02,866
and even highlight exactly

910
00:43:02,866 --> 00:43:04,466
where the change

911
00:43:04,466 --> 00:43:08,066
If I want to compare

912
00:43:08,216 --> 00:43:10,716
I can actually pop this up

913
00:43:10,716 --> 00:43:12,056
to the file I want

914
00:43:12,786 --> 00:43:15,506
or I can even compare two

915
00:43:15,506 --> 00:43:17,666
against each other by

916
00:43:17,666 --> 00:43:18,256
on the left.

917
00:43:19,816 --> 00:43:22,306
I think these changes are great,

918
00:43:22,306 --> 00:43:24,036
to go ahead and commit

919
00:43:25,256 --> 00:43:27,706
To commit, I'm going to go to

920
00:43:27,706 --> 00:43:30,366
and choose the Commit

921
00:43:30,366 --> 00:43:31,596
down Xcode's commit sheet.

922
00:43:32,846 --> 00:43:35,316
On the left, I can see all

923
00:43:35,316 --> 00:43:37,986
including some settings

924
00:43:37,986 --> 00:43:40,306
I'll get the comparison editor

925
00:43:40,516 --> 00:43:42,646
to give me one last chance

926
00:43:43,966 --> 00:43:47,246
From here, I can even discard

927
00:43:47,246 --> 00:43:49,956
on the change marker and

928
00:43:49,956 --> 00:43:52,366
if I only want to commit some

929
00:43:53,086 --> 00:43:54,856
In this case, I want

930
00:43:54,856 --> 00:43:56,106
so let's give it

931
00:43:56,556 --> 00:44:00,916
I'll say Fixed Tests, and I

932
00:43:56,556 --> 00:44:00,916
I'll say Fixed Tests, and I

933
00:44:00,916 --> 00:44:03,686
to my coworkers when I commit,

934
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:06,296
And let's go ahead and

935
00:44:07,016 --> 00:44:07,956
So Xcode's committing.

936
00:44:07,956 --> 00:44:11,646
It's pushed our changes off to

937
00:44:12,436 --> 00:44:15,036
When you're ready to go

938
00:44:15,506 --> 00:44:18,136
to your testers or to the App

939
00:44:18,136 --> 00:44:20,756
to do that or if there's

940
00:44:20,756 --> 00:44:23,966
today that you want to learn

941
00:44:23,966 --> 00:44:25,076
out Xcode's Help Book.

942
00:44:25,876 --> 00:44:28,506
You can get at the Help

943
00:44:28,796 --> 00:44:33,496
by choosing Xcode Help, and

944
00:44:33,496 --> 00:44:36,126
for whatever you want more

945
00:44:36,126 --> 00:44:37,186
through a list of topics.

946
00:44:37,476 --> 00:44:40,346
For example, Archive and Output

947
00:44:40,706 --> 00:44:42,786
Here Xcode tells me how

948
00:44:42,786 --> 00:44:43,756
for distributing my app.

949
00:44:45,156 --> 00:44:47,416
All right, well, we've taken you

950
00:44:47,416 --> 00:44:49,126
through a pretty complete

951
00:44:49,706 --> 00:44:51,536
but there's one more key

952
00:44:51,536 --> 00:44:54,376
like to leave you with before

953
00:44:54,376 --> 00:44:56,656
to customize your source

954
00:44:56,686 --> 00:44:57,946
sorry, how to customize

955
00:44:58,036 --> 00:45:00,386
and configure them

956
00:44:58,036 --> 00:45:00,386
and configure them

957
00:45:01,246 --> 00:45:03,656
To take you through Xcode's

958
00:45:03,986 --> 00:45:08,806
I'd like to invite Najla back up

959
00:45:09,516 --> 00:45:13,546
[ Applause ]

960
00:45:14,046 --> 00:45:14,576
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Rick.

961
00:45:15,626 --> 00:45:18,336
So now you know the basic

962
00:45:18,336 --> 00:45:20,416
and when you're just

963
00:45:20,846 --> 00:45:23,816
that's probably all you'll

964
00:45:23,816 --> 00:45:26,096
on more complex projects,

965
00:45:26,096 --> 00:45:28,096
to configure your

966
00:45:29,686 --> 00:45:30,926
So let's take a quick tour

967
00:45:31,006 --> 00:45:33,326
of Xcode's core configuration

968
00:45:33,726 --> 00:45:36,126
so that you'll understand

969
00:45:36,976 --> 00:45:40,296
So there are five concepts that

970
00:45:41,226 --> 00:45:44,326
Xcode projects and the

971
00:45:45,586 --> 00:45:47,666
the Build settings

972
00:45:47,726 --> 00:45:51,956
that configure how Xcode

973
00:45:51,956 --> 00:45:57,886
for organizing your project.

974
00:45:57,886 --> 00:46:01,366
So let's begin by

975
00:45:57,886 --> 00:46:01,366
So let's begin by

976
00:46:02,096 --> 00:46:05,186
A project is a document

977
00:46:05,186 --> 00:46:08,426
to organize your code

978
00:46:09,826 --> 00:46:13,566
You have references to source

979
00:46:14,896 --> 00:46:19,536
on disc, targets which actually

980
00:46:19,886 --> 00:46:23,196
like your app, Build settings

981
00:46:23,286 --> 00:46:25,846
which configure how your

982
00:46:27,486 --> 00:46:30,646
and schemes which configure

983
00:46:31,086 --> 00:46:32,736
such as Run, with your targets.

984
00:46:34,856 --> 00:46:36,616
Now, to access your

985
00:46:37,066 --> 00:46:38,716
you select your project

986
00:46:38,716 --> 00:46:42,426
you select the popover

987
00:46:42,876 --> 00:46:44,386
and select your project there.

988
00:46:45,356 --> 00:46:48,496
Now, your project settings are

989
00:46:49,256 --> 00:46:51,166
your Info and Build

990
00:46:51,806 --> 00:46:54,236
And most common settings

991
00:46:54,956 --> 00:46:56,266
There's one that I

992
00:46:56,316 --> 00:46:58,536
which is the deployment

993
00:46:59,846 --> 00:47:02,246
Your deployment target

994
00:46:59,846 --> 00:47:02,246
Your deployment target

995
00:47:02,636 --> 00:47:04,316
that your app can

996
00:47:04,866 --> 00:47:08,736
Currently, our app only supports

997
00:47:08,966 --> 00:47:12,226
to support iOS 9, I could change

998
00:47:13,056 --> 00:47:16,356
Let's move on to

999
00:47:16,356 --> 00:47:21,506
A target contains the

1000
00:47:22,036 --> 00:47:23,876
like an app or a framework.

1001
00:47:25,166 --> 00:47:27,966
The thing that your target

1002
00:47:28,186 --> 00:47:32,236
The set of steps that

1003
00:47:32,326 --> 00:47:34,836
to build its product

1004
00:47:35,946 --> 00:47:38,956
And lastly, a target

1005
00:47:39,186 --> 00:47:41,606
to configure how it

1006
00:47:43,036 --> 00:47:46,206
Now, one thing to note

1007
00:47:46,206 --> 00:47:47,716
and targets have Build settings,

1008
00:47:47,766 --> 00:47:51,406
and targets inherit the value

1009
00:47:51,846 --> 00:47:54,896
but can override them with

1010
00:47:57,076 --> 00:48:01,556
A target's build phases do

1011
00:47:57,076 --> 00:48:01,556
A target's build phases do

1012
00:48:01,556 --> 00:48:04,906
to build first, compile the

1013
00:48:04,906 --> 00:48:08,026
and link the target against

1014
00:48:08,896 --> 00:48:13,146
You can also add what's called

1015
00:48:13,386 --> 00:48:15,646
to configure other aspects

1016
00:48:16,456 --> 00:48:20,626
You can access your

1017
00:48:21,376 --> 00:48:25,236
by selecting your project in the

1018
00:48:25,236 --> 00:48:26,416
at the top of the editor,

1019
00:48:26,456 --> 00:48:28,176
and picking the target

1020
00:48:29,106 --> 00:48:33,236
Now, your target settings are

1021
00:48:34,356 --> 00:48:37,186
such as the Build Settings

1022
00:48:37,396 --> 00:48:39,506
and the Build Phases tab.

1023
00:48:40,236 --> 00:48:42,336
So let's talk a little bit more

1024
00:48:42,396 --> 00:48:44,736
about those Build

1025
00:48:45,486 --> 00:48:51,076
A Build setting contains a

1026
00:48:51,506 --> 00:48:54,096
that controls some aspect

1027
00:48:54,516 --> 00:48:57,116
For example, there are Build

1028
00:48:57,116 --> 00:48:58,756
which architectures

1029
00:48:59,556 --> 00:49:03,046
whether your code is optimized,

1030
00:48:59,556 --> 00:49:03,046
whether your code is optimized,

1031
00:49:03,386 --> 00:49:04,936
and even how you

1032
00:49:05,696 --> 00:49:10,446
The Build settings are

1033
00:49:10,446 --> 00:49:13,426
and the target level in

1034
00:49:13,886 --> 00:49:17,176
in a big table that contains

1035
00:49:18,006 --> 00:49:22,256
Now, Build settings

1036
00:49:22,256 --> 00:49:25,846
by what's called a build

1037
00:49:25,846 --> 00:49:28,716
a project has a debug and

1038
00:49:29,826 --> 00:49:31,816
For example, when you're

1039
00:49:32,286 --> 00:49:34,416
you probably don't want

1040
00:49:34,876 --> 00:49:36,156
but when you're building

1041
00:49:36,376 --> 00:49:40,876
you do want your

1042
00:49:41,416 --> 00:49:43,256
In addition to fine-grain

1043
00:49:43,596 --> 00:49:46,336
Xcode also offers

1044
00:49:46,336 --> 00:49:48,406
to easily turn on

1045
00:49:49,916 --> 00:49:52,386
For example, for iOS,

1046
00:49:52,386 --> 00:49:55,496
for enabling in-app purchases

1047
00:49:56,236 --> 00:49:59,036
and if you want more information

1048
00:49:59,536 --> 00:50:01,916
you can twist it open in

1049
00:49:59,536 --> 00:50:01,916
you can twist it open in

1050
00:50:02,956 --> 00:50:05,216
You can also enable or

1051
00:50:05,306 --> 00:50:11,456
by using the On/Off switch

1052
00:50:11,456 --> 00:50:13,366
Lastly, let's talk

1053
00:50:15,096 --> 00:50:17,506
So you may find over time

1054
00:50:17,506 --> 00:50:19,126
on a group of projects as a set.

1055
00:50:19,816 --> 00:50:21,926
For example, you might

1056
00:50:22,256 --> 00:50:23,776
that share the same

1057
00:50:23,776 --> 00:50:24,966
like to work on them together.

1058
00:50:25,576 --> 00:50:30,586
In this situation, you can

1059
00:50:30,636 --> 00:50:31,876
that references your projects.

1060
00:50:32,846 --> 00:50:37,706
So when you open your workspace

1061
00:50:37,706 --> 00:50:40,466
of the contents of the

1062
00:50:40,866 --> 00:50:43,526
which makes it easy

1063
00:50:43,526 --> 00:50:45,806
across them as related code.

1064
00:50:47,356 --> 00:50:49,166
So now you know more

1065
00:50:49,226 --> 00:50:51,536
about Xcode's core

1066
00:50:52,176 --> 00:50:53,886
Armed with this knowledge

1067
00:50:53,886 --> 00:50:56,976
to Xcode's basic development

1068
00:50:57,036 --> 00:50:59,566
to make some really

1069
00:51:00,496 --> 00:51:04,686
So today we showed you the most

1070
00:51:04,686 --> 00:51:05,976
by building an application.

1071
00:51:06,906 --> 00:51:09,206
You learned how to create a

1072
00:51:09,206 --> 00:51:12,646
in the simulator and how

1073
00:51:12,686 --> 00:51:15,516
We also talked about some

1074
00:51:15,516 --> 00:51:18,926
such as Command and Option

1075
00:51:20,246 --> 00:51:22,296
We also showed you

1076
00:51:22,296 --> 00:51:26,876
in your project using the

1077
00:51:27,526 --> 00:51:30,956
You learned how to review and

1078
00:51:30,956 --> 00:51:33,386
to configure your project and

1079
00:51:33,386 --> 00:51:34,396
to submit it to the store.

1080

We hope that after this session

1081
00:51:39,446 --> 00:51:42,616
of all of the different kinds of

and we're really excited to see

about to submit your

1093
00:52:19,876 --> 00:52:23,076
There was a session on testing

1094

and on debugging

1095
