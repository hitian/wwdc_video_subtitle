&gt;&gt; Welcome.

00:00:29,356 --> 00:00:32,436
My name's Philippe Hausler, and

5
00:00:32,646 --> 00:00:35,656
and today we're going to

6
00:00:36,076 --> 00:00:38,406
We'll go over why Server-Side

7
00:00:38,696 --> 00:00:42,526
how all the pieces fit together,

8
00:00:42,796 --> 00:00:46,086
what you don't, some real-world

9
00:00:46,086 --> 00:00:49,546
on the server, and, most

10
00:00:49,696 --> 00:00:51,896
to contribute to making

11
00:00:53,516 --> 00:00:56,066
Modern application

12
00:00:56,066 --> 00:00:57,176
for one platform.

13
00:00:57,666 --> 00:00:58,906
It's an ecosystem.

14
00:00:59,206 --> 00:01:01,146
You'd be hard pressed

15
00:00:59,206 --> 00:01:01,146
You'd be hard pressed

16
00:01:01,506 --> 00:01:03,886
that doesn't have some sort

17
00:01:04,306 --> 00:01:06,836
be it from analytics,

18
00:01:07,136 --> 00:01:08,916
or shared state being

19
00:01:09,346 --> 00:01:10,966
servers are an integral

20
00:01:10,966 --> 00:01:12,986
in making rich and

21
00:01:14,106 --> 00:01:16,206
Now building the

22
00:01:16,406 --> 00:01:19,386
often there are contact

23
00:01:20,706 --> 00:01:23,966
You end up humming along,

24
00:01:24,306 --> 00:01:26,166
and the next thing you

25
00:01:26,166 --> 00:01:27,296
in a different language.

26
00:01:27,436 --> 00:01:30,576
This can cause downtime and

27
00:01:30,626 --> 00:01:33,586
and we all know how much we

28
00:01:33,586 --> 00:01:34,066
in code.

29
00:01:35,426 --> 00:01:37,916
But Swift running on the

30
00:01:37,916 --> 00:01:40,646
to just provide a seamless

31
00:01:40,936 --> 00:01:43,866
but also a richer and more

32
00:01:44,416 --> 00:01:46,476
By sharing the right

33
00:01:46,806 --> 00:01:48,716
time can be saved not

34
00:01:48,806 --> 00:01:51,216
but also testing and QA.

35
00:01:51,816 --> 00:01:53,216
But it's not just the language.

36
00:01:53,466 --> 00:01:54,166
It's the API's.

37
00:01:55,196 --> 00:01:57,996
It's often hard to disambiguate

38
00:01:57,996 --> 00:02:01,246
from the construction of

39
00:01:57,996 --> 00:02:01,246
from the construction of

40
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:04,476
like strings, arrays,

41
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:06,626
They often become a core set

42
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:08,866
of libraries expressing

43
00:02:09,196 --> 00:02:12,086
And with that, it brings us

44
00:02:12,146 --> 00:02:15,186
not just on the server,

45
00:02:15,186 --> 00:02:16,486
on all platforms.

46
00:02:17,906 --> 00:02:19,836
As in early design

47
00:02:20,226 --> 00:02:23,596
Swift wouldn't just be

48
00:02:23,746 --> 00:02:27,516
It can by its very nature

49
00:02:27,636 --> 00:02:30,756
and with the community's help,

50
00:02:30,756 --> 00:02:33,326
to be realized with

51
00:02:33,326 --> 00:02:36,146
like [inaudible] SD,

52
00:02:36,146 --> 00:02:38,706
and even things like

53
00:02:39,016 --> 00:02:41,206
Some pretty exciting stuff.

54
00:02:42,146 --> 00:02:45,346
On all of these, Swift relies

55
00:02:45,706 --> 00:02:48,166
Building on top of that, you

56
00:02:48,606 --> 00:02:51,366
It provides some of those

57
00:02:51,366 --> 00:02:53,566
blocks and data structures.

58
00:02:54,096 --> 00:02:58,266
On Darwin, we have an

59
00:02:58,536 --> 00:03:01,526
that aids system frameworks

60
00:02:58,536 --> 00:03:01,526
that aids system frameworks

61
00:03:01,996 --> 00:03:06,096
but since there is no foundation

62
00:03:06,376 --> 00:03:08,886
a portable interface

63
00:03:08,886 --> 00:03:10,406
in those fundamental pieces.

64
00:03:10,926 --> 00:03:13,926
We started off with an outline

65
00:03:13,926 --> 00:03:16,216
and a few initial

66
00:03:16,306 --> 00:03:19,936
and with the community, we have

67
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:21,826
that are needed for

68
00:03:23,256 --> 00:03:25,126
So when you application

69
00:03:25,456 --> 00:03:26,786
you can see that all

70
00:03:26,786 --> 00:03:30,356
of the pieces just fit together

71
00:03:30,766 --> 00:03:33,666
With Swift built in this

72
00:03:33,746 --> 00:03:37,466
you can pick the right pieces

73
00:03:37,466 --> 00:03:39,816
for the server and use

74
00:03:39,816 --> 00:03:42,666
that you're used to using.

75
00:03:42,766 --> 00:03:45,446
Swift.org is the central place

76
00:03:45,446 --> 00:03:47,806
for getting the most

77
00:03:47,806 --> 00:03:50,026
Signing up for the

78
00:03:50,026 --> 00:03:53,306
for the GitHub repositories or

79
00:03:53,786 --> 00:03:56,116
or a great place to

80
00:03:56,116 --> 00:03:58,116
on the most recent

81
00:03:58,156 --> 00:04:00,726
It is the place for

82
00:03:58,156 --> 00:04:00,726
It is the place for

83
00:04:01,596 --> 00:04:04,336
So what comes in this toolbox?

84
00:04:05,316 --> 00:04:07,466
Out of the box, you get

85
00:04:07,466 --> 00:04:09,176
on both Linux and Mac.

86
00:04:09,846 --> 00:04:13,426
So you can develop on your Mac

87
00:04:13,616 --> 00:04:16,456
There are continuous

88
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:21,656
that the changes that are made

89
00:04:21,766 --> 00:04:23,706
and continuously integrate

90
00:04:23,706 --> 00:04:25,856
so that everything

91
00:04:25,856 --> 00:04:28,316
You have the standard library.

92
00:04:28,746 --> 00:04:32,106
That gives you those basic

93
00:04:32,106 --> 00:04:34,176
structures, and types

94
00:04:34,176 --> 00:04:36,096
in building any Swift

95
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:40,966
but you also get Foundation,

96
00:04:40,966 --> 00:04:43,086
within the, the Swift

97
00:04:43,586 --> 00:04:46,326
These give you a cross

98
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:49,476
that can keep your code

99
00:04:49,476 --> 00:04:51,116
across multiple platforms.

100
00:04:52,016 --> 00:04:54,986
But you also get a suite of

101
00:04:55,296 --> 00:04:59,136
and debugging Swift apps as well

102
00:04:59,136 --> 00:05:02,346
try out some of those new

103
00:04:59,136 --> 00:05:02,346
try out some of those new

104
00:05:02,346 --> 00:05:05,126
of these things on

105
00:05:06,896 --> 00:05:09,806
Now there are a few things

106
00:05:10,046 --> 00:05:12,836
There was a design, a design

107
00:05:12,836 --> 00:05:15,696
that some things just

108
00:05:15,766 --> 00:05:18,676
in a cross platform nature,

109
00:05:18,746 --> 00:05:21,886
better served to let developers

110
00:05:21,966 --> 00:05:23,466
since they're highly

111
00:05:24,646 --> 00:05:27,036
New platforms are not just code.

112
00:05:27,556 --> 00:05:30,476
They are continuous

113
00:05:30,476 --> 00:05:32,036
and the champions reporting

114
00:05:32,036 --> 00:05:36,436
to new platforms usually know

115
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:42,116
User interface is a very

116
00:05:42,586 --> 00:05:44,446
On iOS, you have UIKit.

117
00:05:44,896 --> 00:05:48,866
On Mac, you have

118
00:05:48,866 --> 00:05:51,076
that they share a

119
00:05:51,146 --> 00:05:53,636
there have to be

120
00:05:53,636 --> 00:05:55,556
because they're solving

121
00:05:56,426 --> 00:06:00,016
For that matter, UI

122
00:05:56,426 --> 00:06:00,016
For that matter, UI

123
00:06:00,016 --> 00:06:04,746
and sometimes the user in user

124
00:06:04,746 --> 00:06:06,696
instead, it's another

125
00:06:06,746 --> 00:06:08,776
that is routing a

126
00:06:09,586 --> 00:06:12,996
These are all clearly something

127
00:06:13,826 --> 00:06:16,326
Now deploying your

128
00:06:16,326 --> 00:06:18,166
and of itself is a

129
00:06:18,616 --> 00:06:21,236
This way you can pick

130
00:06:21,236 --> 00:06:26,086
that fits your requirements,

131
00:06:26,086 --> 00:06:27,676
of course, your application.

132
00:06:28,526 --> 00:06:31,806
This shouldn't have to be tied

133
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:34,506
Running on the server, you

134
00:06:34,506 --> 00:06:36,406
running with multiple

135
00:06:37,826 --> 00:06:41,126
It's amazing to see the

136
00:06:41,126 --> 00:06:44,266
and sharing community,

137
00:06:44,266 --> 00:06:46,296
of the great things,

138
00:06:46,296 --> 00:06:47,926
to enrich the Swift ecosystem.

139
00:06:48,406 --> 00:06:52,926

140
00:06:52,926 --> 00:06:56,286
of these areas and more,

Hi. My name is John Ponzo.

and I'm thrilled to

152
00:07:30,026 --> 00:07:34,936
We at IBM are very excited about

153
00:07:34,936 --> 00:07:36,896
of the open source, and

154
00:07:36,896 --> 00:07:37,646
for the language.

155
00:07:38,936 --> 00:07:41,956
For those unfamiliar, let me

156
00:07:41,956 --> 00:07:43,656
and our involvement with Swift.

157
00:07:44,426 --> 00:07:47,046
Apple and IBM announced

158
00:07:47,046 --> 00:07:50,436
on enterprise apps

159
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:54,486
And, subsequently, IBM became

160
00:07:54,486 --> 00:07:58,676
of Swift when it was announced

161
00:07:59,546 --> 00:08:01,346
Since that time, we've created

162
00:07:59,546 --> 00:08:01,346
Since that time, we've created

163
00:08:01,346 --> 00:08:03,906
over 100 enterprise

164
00:08:04,736 --> 00:08:08,076
building those apps and

165
00:08:08,596 --> 00:08:12,026
and we also have one of

166
00:08:12,026 --> 00:08:15,126

168
00:08:18,636 --> 00:08:22,216
and solutions consistently

169
00:08:22,216 --> 00:08:25,066
of the backend, enabling

170
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:29,036
As developers, we know

171
00:08:29,316 --> 00:08:33,556
to have a backend, to enable

172
00:08:34,966 --> 00:08:37,446
We also know it's

173
00:08:37,446 --> 00:08:40,666
and safely deploy the right

174
00:08:41,256 --> 00:08:42,596
and that's why we're so excited

175
00:08:42,596 --> 00:08:46,546
to help bring Swift

176
00:08:46,956 --> 00:08:48,696
We appreciate the

177

00:08:52,786 --> 00:08:55,596
to code contributions and

179

that are forming.

at IBM to help the open

183

to the server.

184
00:09:04,726 --> 00:09:07,156
First, I'll tell you about

185
00:09:07,256 --> 00:09:09,466
and tell you about

186
00:09:09,606 --> 00:09:12,666
and Swift package catalog

187
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:16,316

Next, we are motivated by

190
00:09:24,106 --> 00:09:26,896
that links the client and

191
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:30,046
we created the Kitura web

192
00:09:30,046 --> 00:09:32,776
to motivate and prioritize

193
00:09:33,036 --> 00:09:36,556
into the core libraries of

194
00:09:38,176 --> 00:09:41,296
And next, Cloud enablement

195
00:09:41,296 --> 00:09:44,446
of the development

196
00:09:44,506 --> 00:09:48,316
to make it even easier and fun

197
00:09:48,786 --> 00:09:51,836
Through early support in the

198
00:09:51,836 --> 00:09:56,736
and the introduction of

199
00:09:56,976 --> 00:10:00,566
to help deploy that

200
00:09:56,976 --> 00:10:00,566
to help deploy that

201
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:03,896
When Swift.org was

202
00:10:04,296 --> 00:10:06,716
one of the first things

203
00:10:06,716 --> 00:10:08,636
to help grow the

204
00:10:09,476 --> 00:10:11,566
We saw the value of the

205
00:10:11,566 --> 00:10:14,046
to quickly introduce

206
00:10:14,586 --> 00:10:18,296
We created the Sandbox that

207
00:10:18,676 --> 00:10:21,646
to easily run and

208
00:10:22,316 --> 00:10:25,346
The Sandbox runs in a

209
00:10:25,346 --> 00:10:28,816
you can easily start writing

210
00:10:29,016 --> 00:10:30,596
and see the execution

211
00:10:31,616 --> 00:10:34,636
Since we released the

212
00:10:34,636 --> 00:10:37,546
of enhancements based on

213
00:10:38,146 --> 00:10:42,916
The Sandbox currently supports

214
00:10:44,056 --> 00:10:46,336
autosaving of code,

215
00:10:46,736 --> 00:10:48,586
to select multiple

216
00:10:49,266 --> 00:10:52,836
Also, to help developers to

217
00:10:52,836 --> 00:10:56,796
around Swift, we added code

218
00:10:56,796 --> 00:10:58,016
by a persistent URL.

219
00:10:58,516 --> 00:11:01,936
You could use this to share

220
00:10:58,516 --> 00:11:01,936
You could use this to share

221
00:11:02,256 --> 00:11:04,576
and developer forums

222
00:11:11,176 --> 00:11:14,816
Thank you, and we've seen

223
00:11:14,816 --> 00:11:17,286
in the Sandbox since we

224
00:11:17,756 --> 00:11:20,406
and this is over

225
00:11:20,786 --> 00:11:22,616
since just this February.

226
00:11:24,006 --> 00:11:26,656
And the Sandbox is

227
00:11:26,656 --> 00:11:28,976
to Swift from other platforms.

228
00:11:29,726 --> 00:11:33,496
In fact, we're seeing

229
00:11:33,636 --> 00:11:36,126
in executions and

230
00:11:36,126 --> 00:11:37,706
from other operating systems.

231
00:11:38,016 --> 00:11:39,286
We're very pleased to see this,

232
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:42,176
and we'd like to see

233
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:46,196
We're also seeing usage

234
00:11:46,786 --> 00:11:50,456
Developers using the Sandbox

235
00:11:51,466 --> 00:11:54,336
Our intent is to continue

236
00:11:54,336 --> 00:11:56,566
to help grow the community.

237
00:11:59,016 --> 00:12:03,206
A vibrant package ecosystem

238
00:11:59,016 --> 00:12:03,206
A vibrant package ecosystem

239
00:12:04,236 --> 00:12:07,706
While the Swift Package Manager

240
00:12:07,706 --> 00:12:10,066
technology, everything

241
00:12:10,066 --> 00:12:13,256
on the server is based on

242
00:12:13,256 --> 00:12:14,526
of Swift-based packages.

243
00:12:15,516 --> 00:12:18,276
Because of this, we found

244
00:12:18,736 --> 00:12:20,586
and to publish our own packages.

245
00:12:21,066 --> 00:12:23,806
So we created the Swift package

246
00:12:24,556 --> 00:12:26,826
We continue to update

247
00:12:27,106 --> 00:12:30,346
as the Swift Package Manager

248
00:12:31,286 --> 00:12:36,156
And today we have over 1,500

249
00:12:36,156 --> 00:12:37,936
packages on the catalog,

250
00:12:38,636 --> 00:12:41,366
and this is up 400

251
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:46,866
Next, when we start

252
00:12:47,386 --> 00:12:48,876
a foundational requirement

253
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:51,256
for any server language

254
00:12:51,256 --> 00:12:52,976
to stand up web interfaces.

255
00:12:53,966 --> 00:12:56,406
While web frameworks are

256
00:12:56,406 --> 00:13:00,086
on ports and routing code

257
00:12:56,406 --> 00:13:00,086
on ports and routing code

258
00:13:01,036 --> 00:13:03,576
we thought it was very

259
00:13:03,576 --> 00:13:05,176
as consistent as possible

260
00:13:05,176 --> 00:13:06,846
with the client-side

261
00:13:07,676 --> 00:13:09,866
And towards that end, we

262
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:13,146
We open source Kitura

263
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:16,496
It's a modular package

264
00:13:17,786 --> 00:13:21,296
It leverages libdispatch and

265
00:13:21,526 --> 00:13:23,026
and utility library support.

266
00:13:25,256 --> 00:13:28,686
It's also driving IBM's

267
00:13:30,126 --> 00:13:33,626
We're using Kitura to build

268
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:36,836
and we're working with the

269
00:13:36,836 --> 00:13:40,306
of committers outside of IBM

270
00:13:41,036 --> 00:13:42,946
It's an important part

271
00:13:42,946 --> 00:13:44,646
to server enable Swift.

272
00:13:45,506 --> 00:13:51,066
We're also optimizing our Cloud

273
00:13:51,756 --> 00:13:54,556
And I'm pleased to

274
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:57,616
to our Cloud foundry-based

275
00:13:58,166 --> 00:13:59,776
that includes everything

276
00:14:00,146 --> 00:14:03,286
to rapidly deploy your

277
00:14:03,386 --> 00:14:04,356
to the IBM Cloud.

278
00:14:05,396 --> 00:14:08,326
These build packs include the

279
00:14:08,696 --> 00:14:11,956
core libraries, and

280
00:14:12,186 --> 00:14:14,376
They're needed to deploy

281
00:14:16,476 --> 00:14:20,566
But in addition, development

282
00:14:20,566 --> 00:14:23,076
to announce IBM Cloud

283
00:14:23,316 --> 00:14:25,906
a Mac companion application

284
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:28,606
to easily build end-to-end

285
00:14:29,796 --> 00:14:31,396
The tool helps you to quickly

286
00:14:31,396 --> 00:14:35,056
and easily connect

287
00:14:35,136 --> 00:14:37,756
with service-side Swift

288
00:14:38,636 --> 00:14:41,606
Just continue developing

289
00:14:41,796 --> 00:14:45,756
and service-side projects

290
00:14:45,816 --> 00:14:49,636
to link those projects and

291
00:14:50,746 --> 00:14:53,496
Now with that introduction, I'd

292
00:14:53,496 --> 00:14:54,896
Patrick Bohrer, up to the stage

293
00:14:54,896 --> 00:14:57,706
who will show you

294
00:14:58,516 --> 00:15:05,126
[ Applause ]

295
00:14:58,516 --> 00:15:05,126
[ Applause ]

296
00:15:05,626 --> 00:15:06,116
&gt;&gt; Thanks, John.

297
00:15:06,386 --> 00:15:07,146
I'm Pat Bohrer.

298
00:15:07,486 --> 00:15:09,026
I'm the Technical Lead for a lot

299
00:15:09,026 --> 00:15:10,886
of the fun stuff we're

300
00:15:11,346 --> 00:15:14,566
So we're thrilled to be

301
00:15:14,566 --> 00:15:16,356
to be leading what

302
00:15:16,356 --> 00:15:17,686
and exciting part

303
00:15:18,366 --> 00:15:20,926
It's fun because I'm going to be

304
00:15:20,926 --> 00:15:23,506
on the server, and it's

305
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:25,876
of my demos are dependent on a

306
00:15:25,876 --> 00:15:27,756
So wish me luck.

307
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:34,366
So as we talk about server-side

308
00:15:34,366 --> 00:15:36,666
of things to a lot of

309
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:37,466
and for this session,

310
00:15:37,466 --> 00:15:39,506
we're really talking

311
00:15:41,246 --> 00:15:42,806
So what are web services?

312
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:45,516
In a very simple

313
00:15:45,516 --> 00:15:46,906
that are off running

314
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:48,456
They're listening.

315
00:15:48,996 --> 00:15:50,526
They're listening for

316
00:15:51,356 --> 00:15:53,056
They're responsible for

317
00:15:53,056 --> 00:15:56,236
to some server-side logic,

318
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:59,326
And now as far as what's out

319
00:15:59,326 --> 00:16:00,596
it could be another application.

320
00:15:59,326 --> 00:16:00,596
it could be another application.

321
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:01,836
Who knows?

322
00:16:01,836 --> 00:16:02,856
It could be another service,

323
00:16:03,266 --> 00:16:05,126
but as simple level,

324
00:16:05,586 --> 00:16:07,846
So to get started, that

325
00:16:08,756 --> 00:16:14,366
Let's go ahead and jump in,

326
00:16:15,076 --> 00:16:16,266
OK. So as I mentioned,

327
00:16:17,126 --> 00:16:19,496
oftentimes these web

328
00:16:19,496 --> 00:16:21,926
and we've heard about

329
00:16:22,236 --> 00:16:23,426
So let's go ahead

330
00:16:23,426 --> 00:16:25,346
for this first demo

331
00:16:25,486 --> 00:16:27,596
Let's go ahead and do that.

332
00:16:28,546 --> 00:16:29,966
So here we have Linux

333
00:16:29,966 --> 00:16:31,516
Make sure I'm not lying.

334
00:16:32,466 --> 00:16:34,526
So let's go ahead and

335
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:35,886
to do some, to play around.

336
00:16:35,886 --> 00:16:38,256
So we'll very creatively

337
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:40,556
You can see we have

338
00:16:41,566 --> 00:16:43,446
And now we'll use the

339
00:16:43,446 --> 00:16:46,206
So every, as John mentioned,

340
00:16:47,026 --> 00:16:49,146
on server-side is

341
00:16:49,516 --> 00:16:51,296
And so we're going to

342
00:16:51,296 --> 00:16:54,526
of the Swift Package Manager

343
00:16:54,526 --> 00:16:58,136
this syntax changes, but for the

344
00:16:58,186 --> 00:17:00,456
it has an initialization step.

345
00:16:58,186 --> 00:17:00,456
it has an initialization step.

346
00:17:01,226 --> 00:17:02,706
And so if we issue this command,

347
00:17:03,116 --> 00:17:04,826
we can see that it's

348
00:17:05,726 --> 00:17:10,195
So based on the structure

349
00:17:11,046 --> 00:17:13,606
the Swift Package Manager knows

350
00:17:13,945 --> 00:17:17,976
And so as you can see here,

351
00:17:18,506 --> 00:17:21,935
and it's created a Sources.main,

352
00:17:21,935 --> 00:17:24,146
to build a Swift, a

353
00:17:24,806 --> 00:17:26,906
So with that said, let's

354
00:17:27,226 --> 00:17:30,586
So we can issue Swift build,

355
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:35,386
And so it's created a

356
00:17:35,386 --> 00:17:38,056
So let's run that.

357
00:17:38,056 --> 00:17:39,396
Ah. Hello world.

358
00:17:44,976 --> 00:17:46,196
But we're building web services.

359
00:17:46,196 --> 00:17:49,776
So let's get real.

360
00:17:49,976 --> 00:17:53,496
OK. So here, this is what

361
00:17:53,496 --> 00:17:54,186
created for us.

362
00:17:54,186 --> 00:17:56,956
So, again, it's best that

363
00:17:56,956 --> 00:17:59,296
on our directory called Plays.

364
00:17:59,296 --> 00:18:00,816
It's named our executed play,

365
00:17:59,296 --> 00:18:00,816
It's named our executed play,

366
00:18:00,816 --> 00:18:02,036
and so that's why

367
00:18:02,526 --> 00:18:05,536
And we want to add one piece

368
00:18:05,976 --> 00:18:08,616
on Kitura, and that's

369
00:18:10,826 --> 00:18:15,276
So now we will go

370
00:18:15,876 --> 00:18:17,346
Let's delete our

371
00:18:17,386 --> 00:18:20,226
and let's add a bit

372
00:18:20,956 --> 00:18:23,926
So what this code does

373
00:18:23,926 --> 00:18:25,026
We're pulling in Foundation.

374
00:18:25,796 --> 00:18:28,216
We're also importing

375
00:18:28,216 --> 00:18:30,116
of Kitura support packages.

376
00:18:31,406 --> 00:18:33,716
Here, we're specifying a

377
00:18:33,716 --> 00:18:34,686
for incoming requests.

378
00:18:34,686 --> 00:18:36,106
We have to route these

379
00:18:36,736 --> 00:18:38,126
And we're going to

380
00:18:38,126 --> 00:18:40,706
right here, that is /hello.

381
00:18:41,486 --> 00:18:45,726
So if any, if any requests

382
00:18:46,046 --> 00:18:46,796
Simple enough.

383
00:18:47,516 --> 00:18:49,436
We'll specify some

384
00:18:50,126 --> 00:18:53,086
and we'll send back a

385
00:18:53,836 --> 00:18:56,286
Now down here we specify

386
00:18:56,286 --> 00:19:00,526
and it's the 8095, and we

387
00:18:56,286 --> 00:19:00,526
and it's the 8095, and we

388
00:19:00,526 --> 00:19:02,086
and we specify our

389
00:19:02,086 --> 00:19:03,166
and then we start the server.

390
00:19:03,996 --> 00:19:04,726
So it's pretty simple.

391
00:19:06,086 --> 00:19:10,186
Let's go ahead and save that.

392
00:19:10,746 --> 00:19:15,256
Now we're going to build

393
00:19:15,786 --> 00:19:17,246
and so we've added

394
00:19:17,246 --> 00:19:18,026
As John mentioned,

395
00:19:18,026 --> 00:19:20,706
we're leveraging

396
00:19:21,106 --> 00:19:22,656
And so what it's doing

397
00:19:22,656 --> 00:19:25,116
the Swift Package Manager's

398
00:19:25,366 --> 00:19:26,946
So we wrote the code

399
00:19:27,386 --> 00:19:29,626
and the Swift Package Manager

400
00:19:29,986 --> 00:19:32,016
it's pulling down our

401
00:19:32,016 --> 00:19:35,046
down some system support,

402
00:19:35,046 --> 00:19:39,426
that you'd need in a, in a web

403
00:19:39,426 --> 00:19:41,566
to listen on sockets

404
00:19:41,566 --> 00:19:43,966
And so each of these are

405
00:19:43,966 --> 00:19:46,256
out on GitHub that

406
00:19:47,896 --> 00:19:51,326
And it's compiled and built.

407
00:19:51,986 --> 00:19:56,786
So now let's go ahead and

408
00:19:57,016 --> 00:19:58,256
So we can see that it's now,

409
00:19:58,786 --> 00:20:01,976
it just says it's

410
00:19:58,786 --> 00:20:01,976
it just says it's

411
00:20:02,206 --> 00:20:07,306
So let's go ahead and

412
00:20:08,056 --> 00:20:11,126
We'll bring up local host 8095

413
00:20:11,326 --> 00:20:12,916
on our, on our Mac and Linux,

414
00:20:13,176 --> 00:20:14,836
and you can see we

415
00:20:14,836 --> 00:20:17,216
So this basically, if we haven't

416
00:20:17,726 --> 00:20:18,916
it'll bring up this page

417
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:21,236
and specify other

418
00:20:21,236 --> 00:20:22,546
You can always override this,

419
00:20:22,946 --> 00:20:25,656
but for us all we've

420
00:20:28,516 --> 00:20:33,526
[ Applause ]

421
00:20:34,026 --> 00:20:36,386
And so, of course, the

422
00:20:36,386 --> 00:20:37,646
to do is say hello world, right.

423
00:20:37,646 --> 00:20:40,626
So the first step, but,

424
00:20:40,626 --> 00:20:42,806
about it, let's go back,

425
00:20:43,386 --> 00:20:46,926
Let's go back and

426
00:20:47,386 --> 00:20:49,646
We have a lot of

427
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:50,996
So we have Foundation,

428
00:20:52,196 --> 00:20:54,176
and we also have the

429
00:20:54,176 --> 00:21:00,116
So add a little helper code here

430
00:20:54,176 --> 00:21:00,116
So add a little helper code here

431
00:21:00,546 --> 00:21:03,566
We'll also add a new

432
00:21:05,366 --> 00:21:09,186
So now, again, here's a new

433
00:21:09,186 --> 00:21:12,666
saying /today, it'll do,

434
00:21:13,006 --> 00:21:14,106
to go get the current date.

435
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:16,876
We'll go ahead and create

436
00:21:16,876 --> 00:21:17,986
like we would on the client.

437
00:21:18,516 --> 00:21:20,836
We'll use that DateFormatter

438
00:21:20,966 --> 00:21:25,196
a time string, and now we'll get

439
00:21:25,196 --> 00:21:27,816
and so here we'll create a

440
00:21:28,276 --> 00:21:31,536
and now because in the Internet,

441
00:21:31,986 --> 00:21:34,976
So we specify message is hello

442
00:21:34,976 --> 00:21:37,086
our time is our time,

443
00:21:37,086 --> 00:21:38,256
we convert that into a string,

444
00:21:38,256 --> 00:21:40,106
and that's what we

445
00:21:40,206 --> 00:21:41,736
So let's take, see

446
00:21:42,586 --> 00:21:45,826
Let's go ahead and rebuild.

447
00:21:46,756 --> 00:21:47,436
Much faster.

448
00:21:47,496 --> 00:21:48,446
All the packages are here.

449
00:21:48,446 --> 00:21:49,486
So that's good.

450
00:21:50,946 --> 00:21:52,086
So, again, we'll run this again.

451
00:21:52,086 --> 00:21:55,126
You can see we're

452
00:21:56,026 --> 00:22:00,176
We'll reload and see we're still

453
00:21:56,026 --> 00:22:00,176
We'll reload and see we're still

454
00:22:00,176 --> 00:22:01,826
and now let's look at today.

455
00:22:02,676 --> 00:22:04,606
And there we go.

456
00:22:04,646 --> 00:22:05,776
We have our JSON payload.

457
00:22:11,476 --> 00:22:13,686
And now, again, every time

458
00:22:13,686 --> 00:22:15,976
it's executing that code,

459
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:18,856
So that's at a very simple

460
00:22:26,556 --> 00:22:28,406
OK. My wife said to take

461
00:22:28,566 --> 00:22:32,996
So that was pretty fun, but now

462
00:22:32,996 --> 00:22:33,646
more interesting.

463
00:22:34,826 --> 00:22:36,916
So as we go through, first

464
00:22:36,916 --> 00:22:39,146
to a really interesting sample

465
00:22:39,146 --> 00:22:40,916
to this community, and

466
00:22:42,306 --> 00:22:45,426
So BluePic is a sample

467
00:22:45,426 --> 00:22:45,996
that's social.

468
00:22:46,876 --> 00:22:51,346
It has a rich client interface,

469
00:22:51,346 --> 00:22:54,406
that we've built and provided

470
00:22:55,176 --> 00:22:59,106
It also has a really

471
00:22:59,106 --> 00:23:03,906
That is, a Swift server backend,

472
00:22:59,106 --> 00:23:03,906
That is, a Swift server backend,

473
00:23:03,906 --> 00:23:07,336
running the IBM Cloud, and it's

474
00:23:07,676 --> 00:23:10,856
services that I'll mentioned

475
00:23:10,856 --> 00:23:12,636
[inaudible] SQL databases,

476
00:23:13,476 --> 00:23:15,686
And if you're, if you're

477
00:23:17,976 --> 00:23:22,296
it even has some use of

478
00:23:22,296 --> 00:23:23,916
programming model

479
00:23:23,956 --> 00:23:25,406
that also supports Swift.

480
00:23:25,816 --> 00:23:28,696
So, again, this package

481
00:23:29,026 --> 00:23:31,046
and it's available now

482
00:23:31,046 --> 00:23:31,766
who want to get started.

483
00:23:33,686 --> 00:23:36,006
So before we dive

484
00:23:36,006 --> 00:23:37,236
I want to spend a little

485
00:23:37,236 --> 00:23:38,316
about the design pattern here.

486
00:23:39,566 --> 00:23:42,966
So unlike before where we had a

487
00:23:43,776 --> 00:23:45,726
we, of course, have

488
00:23:46,076 --> 00:23:47,636
It has our model

489
00:23:47,886 --> 00:23:49,736
and you can see it also

490
00:23:49,736 --> 00:23:50,996
with requests and responses.

491
00:23:51,376 --> 00:23:53,716
And it's talking to

492
00:23:53,926 --> 00:23:55,226
which is similar to

493
00:23:55,226 --> 00:23:57,516
It's just a little bit more

494
00:23:57,516 --> 00:23:59,666
accepting an incoming

495
00:23:59,716 --> 00:24:01,256
routing those to some logic.

496
00:23:59,716 --> 00:24:01,256
routing those to some logic.

497
00:24:01,256 --> 00:24:04,936
And then, finally, we

498
00:24:04,936 --> 00:24:06,876
where we have some interesting

499
00:24:06,876 --> 00:24:10,396
into in a bit, for holding all

500
00:24:11,746 --> 00:24:14,166
So, again, just to dig

501
00:24:14,636 --> 00:24:15,866
So we have the client-side.

502
00:24:16,556 --> 00:24:17,276
It's responsible.

503
00:24:17,276 --> 00:24:20,786
It's very user specific view

504
00:24:20,786 --> 00:24:23,806
you know, interactions

505
00:24:23,806 --> 00:24:26,126
of the application, and

506
00:24:26,486 --> 00:24:28,506
The midtier is responding

507
00:24:28,506 --> 00:24:29,416
with the things they have,

508
00:24:29,806 --> 00:24:31,686
but it's also doing some

509
00:24:31,906 --> 00:24:36,106
So as photos get submitted

510
00:24:36,106 --> 00:24:37,396
it'll accept those photos.

511
00:24:37,396 --> 00:24:39,216
It'll save them into

512
00:24:39,296 --> 00:24:41,056
It'll create some

513
00:24:41,056 --> 00:24:43,506
but it'll do a few other things

514
00:24:43,506 --> 00:24:46,556
So it will take those

515
00:24:46,556 --> 00:24:48,686
over to Watson's Vision Insights

516
00:24:49,116 --> 00:24:51,216
and extract just tags

517
00:24:51,346 --> 00:24:53,836
Is it mountains and lakes and

518
00:24:53,836 --> 00:24:55,366
So it's kind of adding

519
00:24:55,366 --> 00:24:57,216
to our application

520
00:24:57,606 --> 00:24:59,746
It will also notice

521
00:25:00,426 --> 00:25:02,616
and call Watson's

522
00:25:02,746 --> 00:25:03,786
and pull down information.

523
00:25:03,786 --> 00:25:05,356
What was the weather

524
00:25:05,486 --> 00:25:06,576
So we're adding all of that.

525
00:25:06,576 --> 00:25:08,556
So, again, instead of

526
00:25:08,556 --> 00:25:11,036
from the client-side, we're

527
00:25:11,036 --> 00:25:13,416
which is always on, always

528
00:25:13,416 --> 00:25:14,936
and do our service

529
00:25:15,626 --> 00:25:19,056
And the fact that this is

530
00:25:19,056 --> 00:25:22,646
the right code to

531
00:25:23,076 --> 00:25:25,436
So now here is BluePic

532
00:25:26,266 --> 00:25:27,516
It's running on a device.

533
00:25:27,516 --> 00:25:29,436
It's connecting into

534
00:25:29,916 --> 00:25:31,956
The application server,

535
00:25:31,956 --> 00:25:34,766
to all the different services

536
00:25:35,436 --> 00:25:37,476
Now if something comes

537
00:25:37,476 --> 00:25:40,046
or develop this application

538
00:25:40,726 --> 00:25:43,376
Right. Well, as iOS developers,

539
00:25:43,976 --> 00:25:46,296
We pull down the source for

540
00:25:46,846 --> 00:25:49,836
we load it all up into Xcode,

541
00:25:49,836 --> 00:25:50,966
We can debug this.

542
00:25:51,606 --> 00:25:52,876
We can debug the application.

543
00:25:52,876 --> 00:25:54,616
You can even be calling

544
00:25:54,616 --> 00:25:55,806
and making other requests.

545
00:25:56,126 --> 00:25:57,856
So this is something we

546
00:25:58,366 --> 00:26:00,526
but now that this midtier

547
00:25:58,366 --> 00:26:00,526
but now that this midtier

548
00:26:00,816 --> 00:26:01,336
what do we do?

549
00:26:02,136 --> 00:26:03,016
Right. You probably don't want

550
00:26:03,016 --> 00:26:05,546
to be using VI like

551
00:26:06,146 --> 00:26:09,176
But, again, we can

552
00:26:09,446 --> 00:26:13,076
We can pull down the source code

553
00:26:13,076 --> 00:26:15,586
onto our Mac, load

554
00:26:16,056 --> 00:26:18,246
and now we can also just

555
00:26:18,246 --> 00:26:19,556
and debug locally on our Mac.

556
00:26:19,606 --> 00:26:20,926
So we're debugging

557
00:26:20,926 --> 00:26:24,266
It's exciting.

558
00:26:27,256 --> 00:26:30,376
So now our development world

559
00:26:30,486 --> 00:26:32,806
So we actually control

560
00:26:32,806 --> 00:26:34,456
from the client to the midtier,

561
00:26:34,456 --> 00:26:36,156
even to the services

562
00:26:36,536 --> 00:26:38,726
So we, we really are

563
00:26:38,756 --> 00:26:41,596
because we think it brings

564
00:26:41,716 --> 00:26:43,576
you know, as you're doing things

565
00:26:43,576 --> 00:26:45,396
to add some capabilities

566
00:26:45,736 --> 00:26:47,296
it's all in the world

567
00:26:49,036 --> 00:26:51,076
Towards that end, as

568
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:52,776
we thought we can go

569
00:26:53,696 --> 00:26:55,536
So just like we've done

570
00:26:55,536 --> 00:26:56,386
and the Swift Sandbox,

571
00:26:56,746 --> 00:26:59,716
we created this application

572
00:27:00,366 --> 00:27:03,466
as a Mac application to

573
00:27:03,466 --> 00:27:04,146
development world.

574
00:27:04,796 --> 00:27:08,416
So we're really excited

575
00:27:08,466 --> 00:27:11,346
This application actually

576
00:27:11,346 --> 00:27:15,836
to manage this entire stack

577
00:27:15,836 --> 00:27:17,966
there's a lot of things

578
00:27:18,626 --> 00:27:20,546
but why not have some tools

579
00:27:22,126 --> 00:27:24,426
So we're excited to hear

580
00:27:24,426 --> 00:27:26,336
like we have the

581
00:27:26,986 --> 00:27:29,126
And we'll keep, you know,

582
00:27:29,126 --> 00:27:32,196
with this application, and,

583
00:27:32,196 --> 00:27:33,716
we know what we want it to do.

584
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:35,916
We'll keep adding things, and

585
00:27:35,916 --> 00:27:37,606
as well, but we're

586
00:27:37,606 --> 00:27:38,646
about the possibilities here.

587
00:27:39,416 --> 00:27:41,856
So our goal is really to

588
00:27:42,256 --> 00:27:45,186
to keep creating great

589
00:27:45,186 --> 00:27:48,126
by Swift on the server.

590
00:27:48,316 --> 00:27:50,976
So now with all of that

591
00:27:50,976 --> 00:27:52,116
in and do some demos again.

592
00:27:52,926 --> 00:27:55,296
Going to show you just

593
00:27:55,296 --> 00:27:55,806
with Swift.

594
00:28:01,806 --> 00:28:05,886
OK. So first off, this is the

595
00:28:06,306 --> 00:28:08,906
If you want to get

596
00:28:08,906 --> 00:28:11,986
with an interface that's

597
00:28:12,146 --> 00:28:14,896
and for those wanting to

598
00:28:15,146 --> 00:28:18,126
it even has an ability to

599
00:28:18,936 --> 00:28:22,016
to create just a Kitura project

600
00:28:22,506 --> 00:28:23,556
Now the part that's interesting

601
00:28:23,556 --> 00:28:26,276
about this is not only is it

602
00:28:26,276 --> 00:28:28,086
in bringing them down, it's also

603
00:28:28,086 --> 00:28:30,836
under the covers provisioning

604
00:28:31,166 --> 00:28:34,406
to deploy that project when

605
00:28:34,766 --> 00:28:37,266
in fact, when you create these,

606
00:28:37,386 --> 00:28:39,526
because it knows it's

607
00:28:40,126 --> 00:28:41,866
So, again, to get up

608
00:28:42,576 --> 00:28:43,556
it's a great way to start.

609
00:28:45,706 --> 00:28:48,406
For us, we've already created

610
00:28:49,406 --> 00:28:52,476
and you can see we

611
00:28:53,336 --> 00:28:54,296
Very cleverly named.

612
00:28:54,476 --> 00:28:57,166
And here you can see we

613
00:28:57,346 --> 00:29:00,216
a binding between a client

614
00:28:57,346 --> 00:29:00,216
a binding between a client

615
00:29:00,296 --> 00:29:01,466
Both of these are in Swift.

616
00:29:02,056 --> 00:29:06,336
Additionally, if we drill in,

617
00:29:06,656 --> 00:29:09,076
you can see it has a reference

618
00:29:09,076 --> 00:29:12,626
on our, on my machine as well

619
00:29:12,626 --> 00:29:16,446
into the Cloud as well as all of

620
00:29:16,446 --> 00:29:18,266
on behalf of this application.

621
00:29:18,636 --> 00:29:21,946
So, again, I can manage all

622
00:29:23,586 --> 00:29:28,566
As well as I can go ahead and

623
00:29:28,696 --> 00:29:29,786
to look at my client-side.

624
00:29:30,976 --> 00:29:33,046
So here's the BluePic

625
00:29:33,876 --> 00:29:40,096
It is also created, let me zoom

626
00:29:40,226 --> 00:29:41,726
It's a Bluemix.plist.

627
00:29:42,126 --> 00:29:44,476
Knowing this development

628
00:29:44,686 --> 00:29:46,796
against your Cloud

629
00:29:46,866 --> 00:29:50,236
versus remotely it's very

630
00:29:50,416 --> 00:29:55,396
It'll either listen locally to

631
00:29:55,396 --> 00:29:57,206
and pass in the,

632
00:29:58,246 --> 00:30:00,426
So, again, the thought here

633
00:29:58,246 --> 00:30:00,426
So, again, the thought here

634
00:30:01,346 --> 00:30:03,916
So here we'll go ahead and

635
00:30:03,916 --> 00:30:10,436
that somebody's filed a bug

636
00:30:10,436 --> 00:30:11,806
So here's our application.

637
00:30:12,126 --> 00:30:14,556
Again, it's got a

638
00:30:15,106 --> 00:30:16,026
We can scroll through.

639
00:30:16,026 --> 00:30:17,436
We can see some pictures.

640
00:30:17,506 --> 00:30:18,896
If we click on these pictures,

641
00:30:19,956 --> 00:30:21,326
we can see there's

642
00:30:21,326 --> 00:30:22,996
So the name is nature

643
00:30:23,146 --> 00:30:24,076
We can see who took it.

644
00:30:24,456 --> 00:30:26,536
We can see, supposedly,

645
00:30:26,536 --> 00:30:27,656
which we don't have mountains.

646
00:30:28,246 --> 00:30:31,316
So. We can also see what

647
00:30:31,446 --> 00:30:33,586
and then thanks to

648
00:30:34,096 --> 00:30:35,706
we see that there's

649
00:30:35,706 --> 00:30:36,576
So this is interesting.

650
00:30:36,576 --> 00:30:38,726
If I click on tags, I

651
00:30:38,726 --> 00:30:40,376
we have one photo

652
00:30:41,186 --> 00:30:43,086
If I go back, let's

653
00:30:43,086 --> 00:30:46,126
and we can see there's a few

654
00:30:46,126 --> 00:30:48,766
again, all of this was done

655
00:30:48,766 --> 00:30:50,446
We didn't have users

656
00:30:50,446 --> 00:30:51,786
This was just auto extracted.

657
00:30:51,866 --> 00:30:54,166
But we heard that

658
00:30:54,166 --> 00:30:55,546
about when I click cloudy skies.

659
00:30:55,546 --> 00:30:56,346
So let's look at that.

660
00:30:57,696 --> 00:30:59,736
So we click cloudy sky,

661
00:31:00,126 --> 00:31:02,736
So we know what's going on here,

662
00:31:02,736 --> 00:31:05,786
and somehow the server's not

663
00:31:06,486 --> 00:31:07,606
So now let's switch.

664
00:31:08,436 --> 00:31:10,776
We want to go ahead and figure

665
00:31:11,326 --> 00:31:13,196
And so we'll go over

666
00:31:13,196 --> 00:31:15,226
on our server-side code.

667
00:31:15,226 --> 00:31:18,656
It will launch us and

668
00:31:18,656 --> 00:31:20,176
where the server-side code is.

669
00:31:21,206 --> 00:31:23,426
And if I go ahead and

670
00:31:24,616 --> 00:31:28,416
you can see a lot of the

671
00:31:28,416 --> 00:31:30,426
we're doing Swift

672
00:31:30,776 --> 00:31:32,096
We have our Package.Swift.

673
00:31:32,346 --> 00:31:33,316
We have our sources.

674
00:31:33,726 --> 00:31:35,366
But, additionally,

675
00:31:35,366 --> 00:31:37,926
and created an Xcode project

676
00:31:37,926 --> 00:31:40,526
So let's go ahead and open that.

677
00:31:40,826 --> 00:31:45,236
So here's the code, and, again,

678
00:31:45,366 --> 00:31:48,006
So we know that when we

679
00:31:48,006 --> 00:31:51,156
we'll call this get

680
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:54,376
So if we look at this, we want

681
00:31:54,376 --> 00:31:56,046
somehow when we pass in a tag,

682
00:31:56,376 --> 00:31:57,876
we're not returning

683
00:31:58,096 --> 00:32:01,426
So let's set a break point

684
00:31:58,096 --> 00:32:01,426
So let's set a break point

685
00:32:01,546 --> 00:32:08,256
And now we can see our server is

686
00:32:09,206 --> 00:32:11,626
Now let's switch back.

687
00:32:14,796 --> 00:32:19,146
So here we're going to have our

688
00:32:19,146 --> 00:32:21,886
yes so that it will actually

689
00:32:22,206 --> 00:32:23,976
and let's rerun the simulator.

690
00:32:25,286 --> 00:32:28,966
By the way, I'm getting

691
00:32:28,966 --> 00:32:30,416
with all this network

692
00:32:30,416 --> 00:32:32,306
So keep up whatever

693
00:32:34,096 --> 00:32:36,796
OK. So let's just scroll down

694
00:32:36,796 --> 00:32:37,806
problems with.

695
00:32:37,806 --> 00:32:38,626
Let's click on here.

696
00:32:39,356 --> 00:32:41,136
Let's click on cloudy skies.

697
00:32:41,326 --> 00:32:42,126
Ah, great.

698
00:32:43,246 --> 00:32:44,906
Here, we hit a break

[ Applause ]

700
00:32:50,146 --> 00:32:54,456
So if we want to get a feel

701
00:32:54,456 --> 00:32:55,636
and say we want to print tag.

702
00:32:55,636 --> 00:33:01,166
And we can see, kind

703
00:32:55,636 --> 00:33:01,166
And we can see, kind

704
00:33:01,866 --> 00:33:03,126
We can see that the

705

in as cloudy percent 20 sky.

706
00:33:05,876 --> 00:33:06,436
That's no good.

707
00:33:06,436 --> 00:33:07,126
We don't want that.

708
00:33:08,456 --> 00:33:10,046
So let's take a look at that.

709
00:33:10,096 --> 00:33:11,766
We also know that we

710
00:33:12,726 --> 00:33:14,366
So what if we go ahead

711
00:33:15,236 --> 00:33:17,106
to clean this up a bit.

712
00:33:18,796 --> 00:33:20,566
We'll remove the

713
00:33:21,686 --> 00:33:25,846
Oh, this is now a variable

714
00:33:25,846 --> 00:33:30,356
Let's go ahead and build this.

715
00:33:30,576 --> 00:33:31,486
We'll run it again.

Rerun the server.

717
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:38,156
Let's go back to

718
00:33:39,106 --> 00:33:41,886
Oh. There we go.

Let's go back.

Let's click cloudy sky again,

722
00:33:51,556 --> 00:33:52,266
Print to tag.

723
00:33:53,086 --> 00:33:53,896
Ah, much better.

724
00:33:54,126 --> 00:33:54,986
That's what we want.

725
00:33:54,986 --> 00:34:01,046
So let's go ahead and turn off

726
00:33:54,986 --> 00:34:01,046
So let's go ahead and turn off

00:34:01,136 --> 00:34:07,976

I can go back into

752
00:35:30,696 --> 00:35:31,626
things with Swift.

753
00:35:31,996 --> 00:35:34,606
They've not just been

754
00:35:34,936 --> 00:35:36,746
but they've also been

755
00:35:36,746 --> 00:35:38,726
with their vast experience

756
00:35:38,726 --> 00:35:40,386
and streamlining

757
00:35:40,466 --> 00:35:42,606
Some of their work

758
00:35:42,916 --> 00:35:44,716
in making server-side

759
00:35:45,996 --> 00:35:49,126
But you, too, can help make

760
00:35:49,246 --> 00:35:50,946
and there are a number of things

761
00:35:50,946 --> 00:35:53,156
that definitely you

762
00:35:54,366 --> 00:35:56,566
Portions of Swift

763
00:35:56,856 --> 00:35:59,806
There's a lot of work to be

764
00:35:59,806 --> 00:36:01,416
that are not yet

765
00:35:59,806 --> 00:36:01,416
that are not yet

766
00:36:01,726 --> 00:36:05,086
and unimplemented just means

767
00:36:05,576 --> 00:36:07,856
There are number of easy ways

768
00:36:08,286 --> 00:36:12,266
The bug tracker even has a

769
00:36:12,266 --> 00:36:15,856
as starter bugs, but code

770
00:36:16,386 --> 00:36:19,296
Designing new API's and

771
00:36:19,296 --> 00:36:21,406
in Swift are something

772
00:36:21,406 --> 00:36:23,926
on on a daily basis

773
00:36:24,166 --> 00:36:27,516
Many of the discussions are

774
00:36:27,596 --> 00:36:29,756
and coming from contributors

775
00:36:30,726 --> 00:36:34,856
And, of course, your packages,

776
00:36:34,856 --> 00:36:36,386
to make Swift on

777
00:36:36,966 --> 00:36:42,066
And if you have any questions

778
00:36:42,066 --> 00:36:45,876
to what we've actually talked

779
00:36:46,016 --> 00:36:48,306
this session, we have

780
00:36:48,976 --> 00:36:52,736
and there are number of other

781
00:36:52,736 --> 00:36:54,626
that I would highly

782
00:36:54,986 --> 00:36:58,616
The API design guidelines

783
00:36:58,616 --> 00:37:03,176
of our thoughts behind actually

784
00:36:58,616 --> 00:37:03,176
of our thoughts behind actually

785
00:37:03,786 --> 00:37:07,256
and I would highly suggest

786
00:37:07,256 --> 00:37:09,186
at the What's New in

787
00:37:09,576 --> 00:37:12,666
All of the new value

788
00:37:12,666 --> 00:37:15,086
that are being added are

789
00:37:15,086 --> 00:37:16,186
on the server as well.

790
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:19,206
Of course, performance is

791
00:37:19,206 --> 00:37:20,216
local application.

792
00:37:20,986 --> 00:37:22,576
We all, we need to

793
00:37:22,576 --> 00:37:25,186
that our servers are going

794
00:37:25,516 --> 00:37:29,606
So performance, all across the

795
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:33,716
by far, something to look into,

796
00:37:33,716 --> 00:37:36,886
to take a look at the

797
00:37:36,886 --> 00:37:38,956
that are being released

798
00:37:39,536 --> 00:37:41,976
And with that, thank
