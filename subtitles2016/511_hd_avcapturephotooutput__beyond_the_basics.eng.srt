00:00:20,496 --> 00:00:22,836
&gt;&gt; Hi and welcome

3
00:00:22,906 --> 00:00:25,786
AVCapturePhotoOutput,

4
00:00:26,506 --> 00:00:29,246
This is a chock talk

5
00:00:29,636 --> 00:00:31,506
Advances in iOS Photography.

6
00:00:32,156 --> 00:00:33,056
I'm Brad Ford.

7
00:00:33,186 --> 00:00:35,566
I'm an engineer on the core

8
00:00:36,116 --> 00:00:42,376
In session 501, we focused on AV

9
00:00:42,726 --> 00:00:45,596
specifically the

10
00:00:46,246 --> 00:00:49,566
which is a new interface

11
00:00:50,796 --> 00:00:55,526
This output supports Capturing

12
00:00:56,866 --> 00:01:01,356
Wide Color Content, and

13
00:00:56,866 --> 00:01:01,356
Wide Color Content, and

14
00:01:01,646 --> 00:01:04,186
If you haven't watched

15
00:01:04,396 --> 00:01:07,746
I recommend pausing here and

16
00:01:08,126 --> 00:01:09,906
You'll get a lot more

17
00:01:10,456 --> 00:01:15,796
In this session, we'll move

18
00:01:15,796 --> 00:01:19,326
basics and discuss two important

19
00:01:19,326 --> 00:01:20,746
for in Session 501.

20
00:01:21,246 --> 00:01:23,246
Namely, Scene Monitoring,

21
00:01:23,946 --> 00:01:26,796
and Resource Preparation

22
00:01:27,646 --> 00:01:30,296
Lastly, we'll spend a few

23
00:01:30,296 --> 00:01:31,886
but still very important topic,

24
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:35,906
Camera Privacy Policy

25
00:01:37,686 --> 00:01:38,966
By way of minimal review,

26
00:01:39,636 --> 00:01:42,976
the new AVCapturePhotoOutput

27
00:01:42,976 --> 00:01:43,846
that addresses some

28
00:01:43,846 --> 00:01:47,356
of AVCaptureStillImangeOutput's

29
00:01:48,506 --> 00:01:51,846
AVCapturePhotoOutput uses a

30
00:01:52,216 --> 00:01:53,546
There are clear delineations

31
00:01:53,546 --> 00:01:55,666
between mutable and

32
00:01:56,106 --> 00:01:58,136
It uses a separate object

33
00:01:58,136 --> 00:02:00,216
to encapsulate per

34
00:01:58,136 --> 00:02:00,216
to encapsulate per

35
00:02:00,446 --> 00:02:02,456
called AVCapturePhotoSettings.

36
00:02:02,916 --> 00:02:05,666
You pass it when making

37
00:02:06,446 --> 00:02:08,476
It uses a delegate

38
00:02:08,476 --> 00:02:11,206
for tracking the progress

39
00:02:11,526 --> 00:02:14,386
This is called the

40
00:02:14,386 --> 00:02:15,026
protocol.

41
00:02:15,516 --> 00:02:19,956
All callbacks in the delegate

42
00:02:19,996 --> 00:02:22,696
of

43
00:02:23,186 --> 00:02:24,546
This is an immutable object

44
00:02:24,546 --> 00:02:26,896
in which all photo

45
00:02:29,586 --> 00:02:33,356
AVCapturePhotoOutput also

46
00:02:33,356 --> 00:02:36,706
a subset of these capture

47
00:02:38,656 --> 00:02:41,126
Scene monitoring

48
00:02:41,126 --> 00:02:44,196
that informs the user what

49
00:02:44,196 --> 00:02:45,066
currently active.

50
00:02:45,776 --> 00:02:49,146
In this screenshot of Apple's

51
00:02:49,146 --> 00:02:50,746
in a low-light situation.

52
00:02:51,576 --> 00:02:55,546
The flash iconography at the

53
00:02:55,546 --> 00:02:58,036
that the user is

54
00:02:58,326 --> 00:03:00,336
meaning the flash

55
00:02:58,326 --> 00:03:00,336
meaning the flash

56
00:03:00,336 --> 00:03:01,856
if the situation requires it.

57
00:03:02,796 --> 00:03:06,006
Apple's Camera app is a client

58
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:08,016
which performs Scene Monitoring

59
00:03:08,016 --> 00:03:11,126
to drive the flash

60
00:03:11,376 --> 00:03:12,786
that you see in the top middle.

61
00:03:13,296 --> 00:03:17,306
The presence of the yellow

62
00:03:17,306 --> 00:03:20,326
that if they take a picture

63
00:03:21,456 --> 00:03:24,706
AVCapturePhotoOutput

64
00:03:24,706 --> 00:03:26,026
for two kinds of scenes.

65
00:03:26,246 --> 00:03:27,766
The first is the flash.

66
00:03:30,096 --> 00:03:32,056
All of Apple's current

67
00:03:32,056 --> 00:03:36,416
as well as the 9.7-inch iPad

68
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:39,886
to illuminate dark scenes for

69
00:03:41,206 --> 00:03:44,496
and a retina flash that

70
00:03:44,496 --> 00:03:47,456
into a true tone flash,

71
00:03:47,456 --> 00:03:49,736
to three times normal

72
00:03:49,736 --> 00:03:51,176
up selfies in low light.

73
00:03:52,616 --> 00:03:56,306
The second type of supported

74
00:03:56,306 --> 00:03:57,396
Image Stabilization.

75
00:03:58,166 --> 00:04:02,186
Still Image Stabilization is

76
00:03:58,166 --> 00:04:02,186
Still Image Stabilization is

77
00:04:02,446 --> 00:04:06,156
that blends differently

78
00:04:06,156 --> 00:04:07,626
in low-light situations.

79
00:04:08,146 --> 00:04:11,066
It might not be totally obvious

80
00:04:11,066 --> 00:04:12,926
a low-light feature, it's not

81
00:04:12,926 --> 00:04:14,936
that your hands shake

82
00:04:15,596 --> 00:04:17,896
It's just that the camera

83
00:04:17,896 --> 00:04:21,125
to gather the same number of

84
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:22,786
to be very, very steady.

85
00:04:23,506 --> 00:04:25,726
Still Image Stabilization

86
00:04:25,976 --> 00:04:28,876
by capturing multiple images

87
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:30,276
and then fusing them together

88
00:04:30,506 --> 00:04:32,736
to reduce noise and

89
00:04:33,436 --> 00:04:36,226
So at first glance,

90
00:04:36,226 --> 00:04:38,906
or Still Image Stabilization

91
00:04:38,906 --> 00:04:40,286
like orthogonal features,

92
00:04:40,736 --> 00:04:42,416
but they're actually

93
00:04:42,636 --> 00:04:44,936
And this causes some

94
00:04:46,976 --> 00:04:50,406
Looking at this graph, we see

95
00:04:50,406 --> 00:04:51,796
for Flash Capture with

96
00:04:51,796 --> 00:04:54,006
and without Still

97
00:04:54,536 --> 00:04:56,336
I've shortened Still

98
00:04:56,336 --> 00:04:57,996
to SIS for brevity.

99
00:04:58,806 --> 00:05:01,206
The blue bar represents

100
00:04:58,806 --> 00:05:01,206
The blue bar represents

101
00:05:01,206 --> 00:05:03,326
at which the photo

102
00:05:03,486 --> 00:05:05,546
if you've opted in for SIS.

103
00:05:06,446 --> 00:05:09,196
The green bar represents

104
00:05:09,196 --> 00:05:12,736
for flash if you've

105
00:05:12,736 --> 00:05:15,356
Note that with SIS on,

106
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:17,286
without the flash

107
00:05:18,146 --> 00:05:21,846
This is because SIS lowers the

108
00:05:22,176 --> 00:05:23,546
so the flash is not needed.

109
00:05:23,976 --> 00:05:27,216
If your current scene's

110
00:05:27,706 --> 00:05:28,936
the answer to the question,

111
00:05:29,206 --> 00:05:32,016
is this a flash scene

112
00:05:32,826 --> 00:05:36,156
But if the light level is

113
00:05:36,156 --> 00:05:38,986
on whether you're interested in

114
00:05:39,326 --> 00:05:40,856
and the inverse is true also.

115
00:05:41,476 --> 00:05:43,776
So what to do.

116
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:45,756
The AVCapturePhotoOutput

117
00:05:45,756 --> 00:05:48,416
of capture you want

118
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:50,816
But if you're using

119
00:05:51,096 --> 00:05:52,626
it needs to run continuously.

120
00:05:53,206 --> 00:05:55,976
Is the current scene a SIS

121
00:05:56,476 --> 00:06:01,446
In AVCapturePhotoOutput we've

122
00:05:56,476 --> 00:06:01,446
In AVCapturePhotoOutput we've

123
00:06:01,446 --> 00:06:04,406
with a specific API for

124
00:06:04,756 --> 00:06:06,826
photoSettingsForSceneMonitoring.

125
00:06:08,096 --> 00:06:11,046
And we've provided two key

126
00:06:11,046 --> 00:06:13,116
that can asynchronously

127
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:16,046
when scene suitability

128
00:06:16,046 --> 00:06:18,426
to Still Image Stabilization

129
00:06:18,956 --> 00:06:23,906
You create an

130
00:06:24,086 --> 00:06:27,306
specifically for Scene

131
00:06:27,306 --> 00:06:28,186
which features you'd

132
00:06:28,186 --> 00:06:30,466
like AVCapturePhotoOutput

133
00:06:31,306 --> 00:06:35,856
Here I've set the flash

134
00:06:36,536 --> 00:06:38,586
that I'm interested in

135
00:06:38,586 --> 00:06:41,026
when it's available,

136
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:43,676
isAutoStillImageStabilization

137
00:06:44,266 --> 00:06:46,276
So SIS should be considered too.

138
00:06:46,956 --> 00:06:50,276
SIS tends to give better image

139
00:06:50,706 --> 00:06:53,506
so if a scene falls into the

140
00:06:53,506 --> 00:06:57,276
and flash, the photoOutput

141
00:06:58,256 --> 00:07:01,146
Next, I assign this object

142
00:06:58,256 --> 00:07:01,146
Next, I assign this object

143
00:07:01,216 --> 00:07:03,026
for SceneMonitoring property.

144
00:07:03,676 --> 00:07:04,656
This property can be set

145
00:07:04,656 --> 00:07:07,146
at any time including

146
00:07:07,146 --> 00:07:08,626
AVCaptureSession running.

147
00:07:10,156 --> 00:07:12,276
To be informed of

148
00:07:12,276 --> 00:07:14,436
and Still Image Stabilization

149
00:07:14,966 --> 00:07:18,896
I add key value observers for

150
00:07:19,136 --> 00:07:21,176
and

151
00:07:21,176 --> 00:07:21,836
Properties.

152
00:07:22,426 --> 00:07:25,286
And I'm called back as

153
00:07:25,356 --> 00:07:26,496
for those two properties.

154
00:07:26,496 --> 00:07:31,746
Now let's talk about

155
00:07:32,956 --> 00:07:36,526
photoSettingsforSceneMonitoring

156
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:38,666
and its default value is nil,

157
00:07:38,956 --> 00:07:41,226
meaning no scenes

158
00:07:42,206 --> 00:07:44,966
If you query

159
00:07:45,326 --> 00:07:48,956
or isFlashScene without first

160
00:07:48,956 --> 00:07:52,696
for Scene Monitoring, they will

161
00:07:53,716 --> 00:07:56,286
Once you do configure photo

162
00:07:56,466 --> 00:07:59,826
you can query or key value

163
00:07:59,826 --> 00:08:02,056
properties and get

164
00:07:59,826 --> 00:08:02,056
properties and get

165
00:08:03,496 --> 00:08:05,406
Be aware, though that

166
00:08:05,406 --> 00:08:08,816
for Scene Monitoring

167
00:08:09,286 --> 00:08:11,936
isFlashScene will still

168
00:08:12,456 --> 00:08:12,806
Ditto

169
00:08:12,806 --> 00:08:15,016
for AutoStillImageStabilization

170
00:08:18,056 --> 00:08:20,636
My recommendations for

171
00:08:21,076 --> 00:08:24,596
If your app doesn't display

172
00:08:24,596 --> 00:08:26,776
of scene the user is

173
00:08:26,776 --> 00:08:27,976
to enable Scene Monitoring.

174
00:08:28,596 --> 00:08:31,676
But if you do, monitor

175
00:08:31,996 --> 00:08:35,135
For example, if you intend

176
00:08:35,135 --> 00:08:38,405
but not SIS, then monitor

177
00:08:38,405 --> 00:08:40,956
to auto and auto SIS off.

178
00:08:41,506 --> 00:08:43,785
Doing otherwise will

179
00:08:44,196 --> 00:08:45,526
as your UI might report

180
00:08:45,526 --> 00:08:48,606
that it's not a flash scene

181
00:08:48,606 --> 00:08:50,066
fire when taking a picture.

182
00:08:52,376 --> 00:08:54,086
That wraps up Scene Monitoring.

183
00:08:54,606 --> 00:08:56,426
On to our next Beyond

184
00:08:56,716 --> 00:08:59,026
Resource Preparation

185
00:09:00,936 --> 00:09:04,066
To understand the need for

186
00:09:04,346 --> 00:09:07,116
let's look at AVCaptureSession's

187
00:09:08,976 --> 00:09:11,456
When you call AVCaptureSession

188
00:09:12,236 --> 00:09:15,506
data begins flowing from all

189
00:09:15,506 --> 00:09:17,206
various AVCapture outputs.

190
00:09:17,996 --> 00:09:21,156
Most outputs receive and handle

191
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:23,126
such as the VideoPreviewLayer,

192
00:09:23,256 --> 00:09:26,126
which continuously displays

193
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:29,016
Or VideoDataOutput

194
00:09:29,016 --> 00:09:30,736
to your app via delegate

195
00:09:31,646 --> 00:09:34,866
Streaming outputs such as these

196
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:38,216
render pipeline rebuild if you

197
00:09:38,616 --> 00:09:40,676
You have to configure

198
00:09:40,676 --> 00:09:42,996
of output before you

199
00:09:43,936 --> 00:09:46,226
AVCapturePhotoOutput

200
00:09:46,626 --> 00:09:50,326
since it only receives data from

201
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:54,506
When you request a photo

202
00:09:54,776 --> 00:09:56,336
with settings and delegate,

203
00:09:56,896 --> 00:10:00,456
the photo output delivers just

204
00:09:56,896 --> 00:10:00,456
the photo output delivers just

205
00:10:02,086 --> 00:10:03,506
Unlike the streaming outputs,

206
00:10:03,766 --> 00:10:05,746
the photo output has

207
00:10:06,336 --> 00:10:10,516
It's perfectly positioned to

208
00:10:10,516 --> 00:10:14,036
on demand without causing a

209
00:10:14,036 --> 00:10:15,066
of the render pipeline.

210
00:10:15,556 --> 00:10:18,386
It has the luxury of preparing

211
00:10:20,646 --> 00:10:22,806
Resource preparation

212
00:10:23,346 --> 00:10:26,206
And AVCapturePhotoOutput's

213
00:10:27,996 --> 00:10:31,586
Taking an uncompressed 420

214
00:10:31,586 --> 00:10:34,846
of the AVCapture device

215
00:10:36,056 --> 00:10:38,816
Processed output such as EGRA

216
00:10:38,946 --> 00:10:41,546
or JPEG requires

217
00:10:41,966 --> 00:10:43,786
since there's a format

218
00:10:45,156 --> 00:10:48,056
Flash captures require their

219
00:10:48,316 --> 00:10:50,296
for delivering the

220
00:10:50,446 --> 00:10:52,236
and strobe synchronized result.

221
00:10:53,926 --> 00:10:56,616
Still Image Stabilization

222
00:10:56,696 --> 00:10:57,426
for fusion.

223
00:10:59,086 --> 00:11:01,366
RAW capture requires

224
00:10:59,086 --> 00:11:01,366
RAW capture requires

225
00:11:02,706 --> 00:11:04,956
RAW + JPEG requires

226
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:06,476
of resources big and small.

227
00:11:07,626 --> 00:11:10,286
And bracketed capture

228
00:11:10,486 --> 00:11:12,506
to return multiple

229
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:16,096
And of course, many of

230
00:11:16,126 --> 00:11:19,026
and matched, requiring

231
00:11:21,576 --> 00:11:24,236
With so many capture features

232
00:11:24,236 --> 00:11:25,746
for the AVCapturePhotoOutput

233
00:11:25,746 --> 00:11:28,606
to guess how many

234
00:11:29,346 --> 00:11:32,446
And both over-preparing and

235
00:11:33,586 --> 00:11:36,856
We liken an over-preparing to

236
00:11:36,856 --> 00:11:39,016
of the year, just in

237
00:11:39,766 --> 00:11:41,066
It's a lot of effort for us.

238
00:11:41,306 --> 00:11:42,836
A lot of material invested.

239
00:11:43,096 --> 00:11:45,176
A lot of uneaten cake

240
00:11:46,366 --> 00:11:48,686
Video preview might come

241
00:11:49,496 --> 00:11:51,556
Memory consumption might

242
00:11:52,136 --> 00:11:55,836
Under-preparing is just

243
00:11:56,536 --> 00:11:58,226
If we're not ready

244
00:11:58,446 --> 00:12:01,316
with your requested feature

245
00:11:58,446 --> 00:12:01,316
with your requested feature

246
00:12:01,556 --> 00:12:03,376
while allocating

247
00:12:04,526 --> 00:12:06,566
Fortunately, we've

248
00:12:07,896 --> 00:12:11,946
AVCapturePhotoOutput allows you

249
00:12:11,946 --> 00:12:13,326
of captures you're

250
00:12:13,786 --> 00:12:17,536
You do this by calling

251
00:12:18,526 --> 00:12:21,246
passing an array of

252
00:12:21,576 --> 00:12:24,556
with each one representing a

253
00:12:24,556 --> 00:12:25,996
like it to prepare for.

254
00:12:27,286 --> 00:12:30,056
You can optionally pass a

255
00:12:30,296 --> 00:12:31,646
when preparation is complete.

256
00:12:32,116 --> 00:12:35,976
The photo output also

257
00:12:36,156 --> 00:12:38,496
preparedPhotoSettingsArray

258
00:12:38,826 --> 00:12:41,346
so you can query the settings

259
00:12:41,816 --> 00:12:46,416
The

260
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:47,976
function can do several things.

261
00:12:48,516 --> 00:12:52,206
It prepares resources for

262
00:12:52,206 --> 00:12:53,486
in your array of settings.

263
00:12:54,336 --> 00:12:57,776
Also, it reclaims unneeded

264
00:12:58,336 --> 00:13:02,806
And by passing an empty array,

265
00:12:58,336 --> 00:13:02,806
And by passing an empty array,

266
00:13:03,386 --> 00:13:07,976
It calls you back when all

267
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:12,526
And it returns an error if

268
00:13:13,056 --> 00:13:15,716
This is all delivered via

269
00:13:17,516 --> 00:13:21,646
preparedPhotoSettingsArray's

270
00:13:21,646 --> 00:13:24,146
constructor for

271
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:27,356
which has JPEG set

272
00:13:27,576 --> 00:13:30,126
and AutoStillImageStabilization

273
00:13:33,056 --> 00:13:36,236
preparedPhotoSettingsArray

274
00:13:36,696 --> 00:13:39,736
It persists across

275
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:43,836
or stopRunning, begin

276
00:13:44,436 --> 00:13:45,766
and you can set it and forget it

277
00:13:45,766 --> 00:13:48,266
if you always take the same

278
00:13:49,606 --> 00:13:53,246
Another nice feature of

279
00:13:53,246 --> 00:13:54,446
that it participates

280
00:13:54,486 --> 00:13:57,636
in AVCaptureSession

281
00:13:57,886 --> 00:13:59,266
deferred work semantics.

282
00:13:59,826 --> 00:14:02,286
That is, if you call

283
00:13:59,826 --> 00:14:02,286
That is, if you call

284
00:14:02,586 --> 00:14:05,416
and then change your

285
00:14:05,416 --> 00:14:07,206
or removing inputs or outputs

286
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:10,316
and then set new

287
00:14:10,556 --> 00:14:13,986
and then commit the

288
00:14:14,106 --> 00:14:17,316
won't occur until the

289
00:14:17,946 --> 00:14:20,446
You can atomically change

290
00:14:20,446 --> 00:14:22,026
and prepare your photo output

291
00:14:22,096 --> 00:14:24,616
for the new configuration

292
00:14:25,116 --> 00:14:31,916
You can prepare before running

293
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:34,316
that your app is ready

294
00:14:34,316 --> 00:14:35,826
as video preview starts running.

295
00:14:36,756 --> 00:14:39,586
If you call

296
00:14:39,636 --> 00:14:40,756
when the session is stopped,

297
00:14:41,186 --> 00:14:43,676
it doesn't call your completion

298
00:14:44,086 --> 00:14:47,556
Instead, the handler is called

299
00:14:47,896 --> 00:14:50,766
which is after you call

300
00:14:51,526 --> 00:14:54,416
If your session is stopped

301
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:57,276
of settings and then you change

302
00:14:57,276 --> 00:14:58,536
with another set of settings,

303
00:14:58,966 --> 00:15:01,316
your first completion

304
00:14:58,966 --> 00:15:01,316
your first completion

305
00:15:01,556 --> 00:15:03,306
with prepared set to false.

306
00:15:03,726 --> 00:15:05,676
This is effectively

307
00:15:06,016 --> 00:15:07,706
of the first preparation.

308
00:15:08,236 --> 00:15:11,696
We have three simple

309
00:15:11,696 --> 00:15:13,936
on how you should

310
00:15:14,506 --> 00:15:16,446
Firstly, prepare.

311
00:15:17,486 --> 00:15:20,606
You can always issue a capture

312
00:15:21,066 --> 00:15:24,786
but if the photo output isn't

313
00:15:24,786 --> 00:15:26,796
of capture you want,

314
00:15:26,796 --> 00:15:28,496
that first image back slowly.

315
00:15:30,456 --> 00:15:34,496
Second, prepare before calling

316
00:15:35,076 --> 00:15:36,926
Knowing the kinds of

317
00:15:36,926 --> 00:15:39,736
in lets the session allocate

318
00:15:39,736 --> 00:15:41,096
for you during startup.

319
00:15:42,636 --> 00:15:46,436
Third, re-prepare only

320
00:15:46,866 --> 00:15:49,516
You don't need to re-prepare

321
00:15:49,946 --> 00:15:52,856
just when you change the types

322
00:15:53,206 --> 00:15:56,836
like when your user toggles RAW

323
00:15:56,836 --> 00:15:58,746
on or off in your app.

324
00:16:01,186 --> 00:16:04,276
Not all AVCapturePhotoOutput

325
00:16:04,276 --> 00:16:06,246
for on-demand resource

326
00:16:07,186 --> 00:16:11,006
The first of these is

327
00:16:11,956 --> 00:16:13,396
Some camera formats allow you

328
00:16:13,396 --> 00:16:16,496
to capture a high resolution

329
00:16:16,746 --> 00:16:19,406
than the format's sustainable

330
00:16:19,756 --> 00:16:24,136
For instance, the front camera's

331
00:16:24,226 --> 00:16:27,506
and 6s Plus supports

332
00:16:27,926 --> 00:16:30,346
but can only stream

333
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:33,106
When the camera is

334
00:16:33,476 --> 00:16:36,386
it can either deliver

335
00:16:36,556 --> 00:16:39,106
or 5 megapixel stills depending

336
00:16:39,106 --> 00:16:42,656
on whether your photo settings

337
00:16:43,276 --> 00:16:45,216
But if the camera

338
00:16:45,216 --> 00:16:47,246
for 5 megapixel stills upfront,

339
00:16:47,686 --> 00:16:50,816
so AVCapturePhotoOutput

340
00:16:50,816 --> 00:16:52,996
for the feature before

341
00:16:53,286 --> 00:16:55,736
by setting

342
00:16:55,856 --> 00:16:56,426
to true.

343
00:16:57,226 --> 00:16:59,646
Once you've opted in,

344
00:16:59,646 --> 00:17:01,506
or without high res

345
00:16:59,646 --> 00:17:01,506
or without high res

346
00:17:01,876 --> 00:17:04,386
without causing an

347
00:17:06,226 --> 00:17:09,415
Similarly, LivePhotoCapture

348
00:17:09,415 --> 00:17:11,406
asset as well as a still image.

349
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:14,116
The movie contains

350
00:17:14,685 --> 00:17:17,356
1.5 seconds before

351
00:17:17,806 --> 00:17:20,796
So the capture render pipeline

352
00:17:21,046 --> 00:17:22,586
to do this special

353
00:17:23,726 --> 00:17:26,606
Lastly, live photos

354
00:17:26,606 --> 00:17:28,886
and automatically

355
00:17:29,206 --> 00:17:31,516
if large purposeful

356
00:17:31,516 --> 00:17:33,656
such as dropping one's arm

357
00:17:33,656 --> 00:17:35,336
down to put the device

358
00:17:35,726 --> 00:17:39,576
If you wish to capture full

359
00:17:39,866 --> 00:17:43,496
you must opt-out of autoTrimming

360
00:17:43,576 --> 00:17:44,936
on your AVCaptureSession.

361
00:17:45,456 --> 00:17:51,176
Our last topic of the day is

362
00:17:51,396 --> 00:17:52,966
in iOS 10.

363
00:17:54,586 --> 00:17:57,406
Let's review Apple's Privacy

364
00:17:57,946 --> 00:18:01,816
Photos and videos on a user's

365
00:17:57,946 --> 00:18:01,816
Photos and videos on a user's

366
00:18:02,116 --> 00:18:03,906
private and sensitive data.

367
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:07,816
Use of the camera or microphone

368
00:18:07,816 --> 00:18:10,336
that must be granted

369
00:18:11,426 --> 00:18:13,096
So beginning in iOS 7,

370
00:18:13,466 --> 00:18:16,896
users were notified the first

371
00:18:16,896 --> 00:18:20,526
or microphone and given an

372
00:18:21,146 --> 00:18:22,426
This is a very good thing.

373
00:18:22,996 --> 00:18:26,406
Transparency and trust are well

374
00:18:26,406 --> 00:18:27,416
of tapping okay.

375
00:18:27,936 --> 00:18:33,056
In iOS 10, we're requiring

376
00:18:33,056 --> 00:18:36,806
in transparency by informing

377
00:18:36,806 --> 00:18:38,266
to access sensitive data.

378
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:42,196
Sometimes your UI makes it

379
00:18:43,016 --> 00:18:45,456
Your reason string should

380
00:18:45,926 --> 00:18:49,386
For instance, here AVCam is

381
00:18:49,386 --> 00:18:51,946
to use the camera to

382
00:18:52,376 --> 00:18:53,886
That's a pretty explicit

383
00:18:53,886 --> 00:18:55,706
about what it will
