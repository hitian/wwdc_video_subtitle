&gt;&gt; Hi everybody.

4
00:00:31,826 --> 00:00:33,136
Welcome to our session

5
00:00:33,196 --> 00:00:35,546
on Expanded Subscriptions

6
00:00:36,136 --> 00:00:38,836
My name is Daniel Miao and

7
00:00:38,836 --> 00:00:39,706
on iTunes Connect.

8
00:00:40,366 --> 00:00:42,146
So, we're going to

9
00:00:42,226 --> 00:00:45,326
by doing a quick review of

10
00:00:45,326 --> 00:00:47,846
And then we're going to

11
00:00:47,846 --> 00:00:50,546
of how we're enhancing auto

12
00:00:50,586 --> 00:00:54,356
specifically in iTunes

13
00:00:55,336 --> 00:00:57,876
So, we've received a

14
00:00:58,106 --> 00:01:00,766
around how we can

15
00:00:58,106 --> 00:01:00,766
around how we can

16
00:01:00,886 --> 00:01:02,156
to better fit your businesses.

17
00:01:03,306 --> 00:01:06,016
So, we're very excited because

18
00:01:06,016 --> 00:01:09,136
through new features that

19
00:01:09,186 --> 00:01:10,156
over your pricing.

20
00:01:10,966 --> 00:01:13,026
Help you to retain

21
00:01:13,646 --> 00:01:16,946
And give you and your

22
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:18,256
for managing your subscriptions.

23
00:01:19,866 --> 00:01:21,876
So, let's start with

24
00:01:23,156 --> 00:01:24,776
What is an in-app purchase.

25
00:01:25,806 --> 00:01:29,266
Well, an in-app purchase

26
00:01:29,376 --> 00:01:32,606
or service that your customer

27
00:01:33,826 --> 00:01:37,366
Now contrast with your customer

28
00:01:37,366 --> 00:01:40,996
store and receiving all

29
00:01:42,056 --> 00:01:45,476
Now, there are many ways

30
00:01:45,696 --> 00:01:48,486
But, generally in-app

31
00:01:48,486 --> 00:01:50,386
to give your customers

32
00:01:50,926 --> 00:01:54,346
to get an understanding of your

33
00:01:54,346 --> 00:01:55,916
add-ons to that offering.

34
00:01:57,346 --> 00:02:00,766
Also, if you have a

35
00:01:57,346 --> 00:02:00,766
Also, if you have a

00:02:01,176 --> 00:02:02,906
in-app purchases are

37
00:02:04,496 --> 00:02:08,406
And there are a number of in-app

38
00:02:09,086 --> 00:02:11,636
We have consumables,

39
00:02:12,296 --> 00:02:15,766
non-renewable subscriptions, and

40
00:02:16,856 --> 00:02:19,036
Today we also have

41
00:02:19,206 --> 00:02:22,346
But, free subscriptions will

42
00:02:23,096 --> 00:02:25,556
So, for those of you who have

43
00:02:26,256 --> 00:02:27,556
you can continue using them.

44
00:02:27,986 --> 00:02:30,266
But, you will not be

45
00:02:30,266 --> 00:02:34,146
So, let's go through

46
00:02:34,556 --> 00:02:36,726
First, we have consumables.

47
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:38,736
Consumable is an in-app purchase

48
00:02:38,736 --> 00:02:41,316
that your customers

49
00:02:42,516 --> 00:02:44,546
Here we have an example

50
00:02:44,546 --> 00:02:45,976
on the app store,

51
00:02:46,406 --> 00:02:47,216
It's a great game.

52
00:02:47,216 --> 00:02:51,216
And the way Fallout

53
00:02:51,216 --> 00:02:54,396
to give you the opportunity

54
00:02:55,336 --> 00:02:57,666
You use real money

55
00:02:58,226 --> 00:02:59,366
Add them to your inventory.

56
00:02:59,886 --> 00:03:02,156
And once you've used them

57
00:02:59,886 --> 00:03:02,156
And once you've used them

58
00:03:02,506 --> 00:03:03,876
and you purchase more.

59
00:03:06,006 --> 00:03:09,256
Next we have non-consumables.

60
00:03:09,876 --> 00:03:12,006
The non-consumables

61
00:03:12,006 --> 00:03:15,096
that your customer buys

62
00:03:15,796 --> 00:03:18,256
In this example we

63
00:03:19,086 --> 00:03:20,746
This is an interactive

64
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:23,926
When you purchase this

65
00:03:23,926 --> 00:03:26,746
in the series with the download.

66
00:03:27,426 --> 00:03:31,206
If you enjoy this book you're

67
00:03:31,206 --> 00:03:35,936
from inside of the app either

68
00:03:36,566 --> 00:03:39,146
Once you've unlocked these

69
00:03:39,476 --> 00:03:44,596
Next we have non-renewable

70
00:03:45,216 --> 00:03:48,506
A non-renewable subscription

71
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:51,916
and available for

72
00:03:52,496 --> 00:03:56,206
In this case we have Quizlet,

73
00:03:56,346 --> 00:03:59,286
And this app comes with many

74
00:03:59,776 --> 00:04:04,386
But, if you'd like more features

75
00:03:59,776 --> 00:04:04,386
But, if you'd like more features

76
00:04:04,476 --> 00:04:05,376
Plus service.

77
00:04:06,136 --> 00:04:11,126
You subscribe to Quizlet Plus

78
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:12,566
And after that year if you'd

79
00:04:12,566 --> 00:04:15,736
like to continue using the

80
00:04:15,736 --> 00:04:16,935
for an additional year.

81
00:04:18,426 --> 00:04:21,805
And finally we have

82
00:04:22,706 --> 00:04:25,206
And auto-renewable is

83
00:04:25,206 --> 00:04:27,156
It's a subscription

84
00:04:28,026 --> 00:04:31,956
and it's renewed automatically

85
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:36,006
Here we have HBO Now, which

86
00:04:37,596 --> 00:04:39,746
HBO Now offers a subscription,

87
00:04:40,006 --> 00:04:43,676
a monthly subscription

88
00:04:43,676 --> 00:04:45,686
So, you purchase this

89
00:04:45,686 --> 00:04:49,526
for $14.99 and each month

90
00:04:49,846 --> 00:04:51,876
and you're charged $14.99.

91
00:04:52,326 --> 00:04:54,706
And if at some point you want

92
00:04:55,366 --> 00:04:56,946
you go into you manuals

93
00:04:56,946 --> 00:04:59,976
in your account settings and

94
00:05:00,986 --> 00:05:02,806
Okay. So, it says here a few

app has to belong inside a

120
00:06:26,276 --> 00:06:29,386
Well, we've seen a lot of

121
00:06:29,386 --> 00:06:31,676
around auto-renewables

on your customer's device

138
00:07:21,106 --> 00:07:24,826
into the app store, go into

00:07:24,876 --> 00:07:26,256
into manage subscriptions.

that your customer's

142
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:37,866
If we take a look at one of

143
00:07:37,866 --> 00:07:40,006
of metadata here that you're

144
00:07:40,556 --> 00:07:42,306
We have an app icon.

145
00:07:43,606 --> 00:07:44,526
We have an app name.

146
00:07:44,526 --> 00:07:48,026
And incidentally you can

147
00:07:48,406 --> 00:07:50,626
in iTunes Connect for

148
00:07:51,696 --> 00:07:52,936
You might want to override this

149
00:07:52,936 --> 00:07:56,336
if possibly your app name

150
00:07:56,336 --> 00:07:58,806
In which case it'll be truncated

151
00:07:59,506 --> 00:08:03,506
or if your service name doesn't

152
00:07:59,506 --> 00:08:03,506
or if your service name doesn't

153
00:08:05,136 --> 00:08:07,466
Next we have the name of

154
00:08:08,026 --> 00:08:09,366
that this subscription is in.

155
00:08:09,816 --> 00:08:13,486
This will show up if you have

156
00:08:14,816 --> 00:08:18,026
And finally we have the name

157
00:08:18,626 --> 00:08:19,646
as well as the duration.

158
00:08:20,566 --> 00:08:23,256
Now, if your customer

159
00:08:23,256 --> 00:08:25,626
of these subscription,

160
00:08:26,366 --> 00:08:27,826
and they'll see this view.

161
00:08:29,226 --> 00:08:32,635
Here we see the customer's

162
00:08:32,635 --> 00:08:35,326
with renewal options

163
00:08:35,996 --> 00:08:38,535
These renewal options are

164
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:42,826
in the same subscription group

165
00:08:43,746 --> 00:08:47,036
In a subscription group

166
00:08:47,036 --> 00:08:51,196
of subscriptions that

167
00:08:52,426 --> 00:08:55,906
Now, as your customer moves

168
00:08:55,906 --> 00:08:59,436
between subscriptions they

169
00:08:59,436 --> 00:09:01,126
subscription per group.

170
00:08:59,436 --> 00:09:01,126
subscription per group.

171
00:09:01,786 --> 00:09:03,296
So, for example, if they went

172
00:09:03,296 --> 00:09:05,006
from the full course

173
00:09:05,006 --> 00:09:08,296
to the entree only,

174
00:09:08,296 --> 00:09:11,526
into effect full

175
00:09:12,136 --> 00:09:16,606
Next, if your customers

176
00:09:16,606 --> 00:09:22,666
in a group regularly, that will

177
00:09:22,726 --> 00:09:24,746
That means that as long

178
00:09:24,746 --> 00:09:28,426
within this group you'll

179
00:09:28,426 --> 00:09:31,606
that year that you need

180
00:09:31,956 --> 00:09:32,826
from this customer.

181
00:09:33,376 --> 00:09:37,346
As part of this feature

182
00:09:37,346 --> 00:09:40,386
to be adding the

183
00:09:40,386 --> 00:09:41,876
upgrade, and downgrade paths.

184
00:09:43,336 --> 00:09:46,456
And upgraded goes into

185
00:09:47,356 --> 00:09:49,486
So, in this case if

186
00:09:49,776 --> 00:09:53,216
if we've designated entree only

187
00:09:54,076 --> 00:09:58,006
the switch to full course

188
00:09:58,006 --> 00:09:58,586
selects it.

189
00:09:59,896 --> 00:10:03,336
If the customer downgrades,

190
00:09:59,896 --> 00:10:03,336
If the customer downgrades,

191
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:06,596
into effect at the end of the

00:10:07,346 --> 00:10:12,606
Okay. So, we've talked a

193
00:10:12,746 --> 00:10:14,086
Now, let's take a

194
00:10:14,086 --> 00:10:14,926
of one of these groups.

195
00:10:15,216 --> 00:10:18,696
For those of you who are

196
00:10:18,696 --> 00:10:20,896
you make recognize the

197
00:10:21,526 --> 00:10:23,696
Beginning this fall

198
00:10:23,696 --> 00:10:25,296
to families as groups.

199
00:10:26,896 --> 00:10:29,016
Here we have an example

200
00:10:29,536 --> 00:10:31,246
that has three subscriptions

201
00:10:31,566 --> 00:10:35,216
A one week, a one month,

202
00:10:36,786 --> 00:10:40,276
Today we have a restriction

203
00:10:40,276 --> 00:10:42,946
than one of the same

204
00:10:43,946 --> 00:10:46,606
So, in this case that means you

205
00:10:46,606 --> 00:10:49,606
than one, one year

206
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:52,686
But, we will be removing this

207
00:10:53,286 --> 00:10:54,736
I mean this restriction

208
00:10:55,756 --> 00:10:59,976
So, that will allow you

209
00:11:00,616 --> 00:11:02,866
We call these subscription

210
00:11:03,606 --> 00:11:06,876
Here you'll see an example that

211
00:11:06,986 --> 00:11:09,076
a gold level, and

212
00:11:10,256 --> 00:11:13,026
Each of these levels has two

213
00:11:13,026 --> 00:11:14,886
of six subscriptions

214
00:11:15,986 --> 00:11:19,066
You'll also notice on the

215
00:11:19,776 --> 00:11:22,676
This is how you decide

216
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:24,876
and what is considered

217
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:29,876
For example, if your customer

218
00:11:29,876 --> 00:11:32,446
to platinum, that would

219
00:11:32,446 --> 00:11:34,466
and platinum would go

220
00:11:35,136 --> 00:11:39,336
If they went from gold to silver

221
00:11:39,336 --> 00:11:41,596
into effect at the end of

222
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:45,156
Period. And those are

223
00:11:46,146 --> 00:11:48,826
So, I'd like to invite Jenn

224
00:11:48,826 --> 00:11:50,756
of such subscription

I'm an engineer on the

I'm going to walk you

00:12:03,846 --> 00:12:04,776
for subscriptions

231
00:12:04,776 --> 00:12:06,576
and subscription groups

232
00:12:07,436 --> 00:12:09,496
We're going to be working

233
00:12:09,876 --> 00:12:12,536
which provides recipe and

234
00:12:12,926 --> 00:12:14,366
for various meal plan types.

235
00:12:15,186 --> 00:12:17,566
Now, currently we have

236
00:12:18,066 --> 00:12:19,786
We have a dinner meal plan type

237
00:12:20,286 --> 00:12:22,036
and we have a breakfast

238
00:12:22,036 --> 00:12:24,086
And both of those serve as

239
00:12:24,086 --> 00:12:26,616
So, we're coming out with

240
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:28,656
which is going to be

241
00:12:28,656 --> 00:12:31,026
It's going to be for

242
00:12:31,116 --> 00:12:32,976
So, let's take a look in

243
00:12:41,176 --> 00:12:41,626
Here we go.

244
00:12:41,626 --> 00:12:44,126
Okay. So, I'm going to click

245
00:12:44,126 --> 00:12:46,826
next to in-app purchase

246
00:12:46,956 --> 00:12:48,926
and select auto-renewable

247
00:12:54,656 --> 00:12:55,686
So, here's where

248
00:12:55,686 --> 00:12:57,666
up with my subscription name.

249
00:12:58,246 --> 00:13:01,576
And when I create a new

250
00:12:58,246 --> 00:13:01,576
And when I create a new

251
00:13:01,936 --> 00:13:05,236
in a moment to select either

252
00:13:05,656 --> 00:13:06,516
or create a new one.

253
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:09,316
So, we'll start with the

254
00:13:09,316 --> 00:13:11,136
This is going to be

255
00:13:11,136 --> 00:13:13,336
So, our first subscription's

256
00:13:13,336 --> 00:13:14,556
about different sandwich types.

257
00:13:15,146 --> 00:13:17,086
So, I'll type in sandwiches.

258
00:13:17,826 --> 00:13:21,136
And here's where I'll

259
00:13:21,136 --> 00:13:23,556
Now, once I create my

260
00:13:24,036 --> 00:13:25,376
it can't be edited later on.

261
00:13:25,456 --> 00:13:27,766
So, I need to make sure

262
00:13:27,846 --> 00:13:31,496
So, we're making

263
00:13:31,496 --> 00:13:33,976
of our sandwich subscription.

264
00:13:35,896 --> 00:13:38,256
And then I'll click

265
00:13:39,656 --> 00:13:41,386
So, here's where I'm going

266
00:13:41,386 --> 00:13:44,806
to create our new subscription

267
00:13:48,656 --> 00:13:50,406
And I'll type in

268
00:13:50,966 --> 00:13:54,546
And then click on create.

269
00:13:56,686 --> 00:14:02,766
So, what we have here is our

So, what we have here is our

00:14:04,086 --> 00:14:05,936
And I'll come back to this

00:14:05,936 --> 00:14:07,586
through what's on this page.

273
00:14:07,586 --> 00:14:08,596
But, what I want to focus

274
00:14:08,596 --> 00:14:10,596
on right now is subscription

275
00:14:11,036 --> 00:14:14,376
So, I'm going to go to the

276
00:14:14,376 --> 00:14:15,776
on lunch plans, which

277
00:14:15,776 --> 00:14:17,226
to our subscription group page.

278
00:14:17,226 --> 00:14:25,146
So, here at the top you can

279
00:14:25,176 --> 00:14:26,726
subscription that

280
00:14:27,836 --> 00:14:29,756
Below that we have

281
00:14:29,816 --> 00:14:30,626
reference name.

282
00:14:30,626 --> 00:14:35,246
And below that we have our

283
00:14:35,406 --> 00:14:37,146
And we can add additional

284
00:14:37,226 --> 00:14:38,986
to localize for additional

285
00:14:40,056 --> 00:14:42,236
As well we can go here

286
00:14:42,236 --> 00:14:44,636
to override the app

287
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:47,856
So, in this case my app name

288
00:14:47,856 --> 00:14:50,366
and Shopping lists, which is

289
00:14:50,366 --> 00:14:52,046
up on the account

290
00:14:52,536 --> 00:14:54,146
So, that would get truncated.

291
00:14:54,456 --> 00:14:56,836
So, I'm going to

292
00:14:56,836 --> 00:15:00,816
and just use the short version

293
00:14:56,836 --> 00:15:00,816
and just use the short version

294
00:15:02,676 --> 00:15:04,816
and then go to the top of

295
00:15:05,776 --> 00:15:08,246
So, what I'd like to

296
00:15:08,246 --> 00:15:11,006
to arrange multiple

297
00:15:11,006 --> 00:15:12,926
to create an upgrade

298
00:15:12,926 --> 00:15:15,646
So, I'm going to move over

299
00:15:16,376 --> 00:15:20,926
which has a number of

300
00:15:21,776 --> 00:15:25,736
And what we can do here is

301
00:15:25,766 --> 00:15:29,506
so that they're in an order of

302
00:15:31,116 --> 00:15:33,116
So, first is our full course,

303
00:15:33,116 --> 00:15:34,646
which will be our

304
00:15:34,946 --> 00:15:36,966
So, I'm going to pull that

305
00:15:36,966 --> 00:15:37,926
and move it to the top.

306
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:42,706
And I'm going to take both

307
00:15:42,706 --> 00:15:44,136
We have a one week

308
00:15:44,586 --> 00:15:48,956
And within one ranking

309
00:15:48,956 --> 00:15:53,626
this can have differences

310
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:56,746
The main idea here is

311
00:15:56,746 --> 00:15:58,096
between these two subscriptions.

312
00:15:58,096 --> 00:15:59,676
It's neither an upgrade

313
00:16:00,156 --> 00:16:05,926
And then I'll take omelets only

314
00:16:05,976 --> 00:16:07,976
which is our lowest

315
00:16:14,256 --> 00:16:16,196
And then I'll click

316
00:16:16,746 --> 00:16:21,026
So, as Daniel explained,

317
00:16:21,026 --> 00:16:22,966
within this group are

318
00:16:23,516 --> 00:16:25,466
So, a customer would

319
00:16:25,466 --> 00:16:26,846
of these subscriptions

320
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:30,606
If your intention is to

321
00:16:30,636 --> 00:16:33,236
subscriptions, they would need

322
00:16:34,516 --> 00:16:37,376
So, now this is arranged in

323
00:16:37,376 --> 00:16:41,416
So, full course subscriptions

324
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:41,966
of service.

325
00:16:42,486 --> 00:16:43,686
Muffins and omelets, movies

326
00:16:43,686 --> 00:16:47,046
and omelets are my mid-range

327
00:16:47,396 --> 00:16:49,586
And omelets only is my

328
00:16:49,586 --> 00:16:51,416
And you can actually

329
00:16:51,616 --> 00:16:53,116
of subscriptions as you want.

330
00:16:53,156 --> 00:16:54,386
We just say three for now.

331
00:16:54,386 --> 00:16:56,346

332
00:16:56,346 --> 00:16:58,996
on the side here

333
00:16:59,646 --> 00:17:01,336
And that is about

334
00:16:59,646 --> 00:17:01,336
And that is about

335
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:02,976

340
00:17:16,046 --> 00:17:18,195
price changes with

341
00:17:19,026 --> 00:17:20,986
Will start with territory

Today when you price an

343
00:17:26,826 --> 00:17:29,466
you choose one price tier

344
00:17:30,876 --> 00:17:35,506
Behind the scenes, this price

345
00:17:35,556 --> 00:17:38,026
in individual territories

Now, we at Apple today manage

When there are currency

348

00:18:02,736 --> 00:18:04,506
The way this will work is,

355
00:18:04,506 --> 00:18:07,706
instead of choosing a single

356
00:18:07,706 --> 00:18:10,356
with a base currency

357
00:18:11,346 --> 00:18:14,426
This base price will come from

359

for each territory

360
00:18:21,806 --> 00:18:23,906
on the current exchange

that you plan the price change.

After we generate these

00:18:30,656 --> 00:18:33,716
and you can edit the

364
00:18:34,076 --> 00:18:38,816
Maybe you want to change the

365
00:18:39,276 --> 00:18:42,206
And you can do this for one

00:18:42,206 --> 00:18:43,196
for multiple countries.

367
00:18:44,406 --> 00:18:46,416
Once you set up these

in the context of price changes.

which is all the customers,

377
00:19:18,586 --> 00:19:22,676
that the price has increased and

378
00:19:23,886 --> 00:19:26,826

and re-enable the

Well, beginning this fall,

we're introducing a

or a price increase they

385

and an enhanced email.

386
00:19:51,536 --> 00:19:53,096
From either the push

387
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:57,716
or the email they can simply

388
00:19:57,716 --> 00:19:58,706
into an app store page

where they can review the

where they can review the

393

Now, no matter how good the, no

394
00:20:17,186 --> 00:20:19,776
if we increase the price

that we can lose customers,

396
00:20:21,986 --> 00:20:24,916
which is why we've added the

00:20:35,056 --> 00:20:36,256
Let's take a look at

400
00:20:38,516 --> 00:20:40,316
Let's say we're launching

401
00:20:41,386 --> 00:20:44,376
We'd like to set our

402
00:20:46,016 --> 00:20:47,056
So, we set that up.

403
00:20:48,016 --> 00:20:50,686
And once this in-app

404
00:20:51,686 --> 00:20:54,616
we'll have our early

405
00:20:54,616 --> 00:20:57,706
for both new subscriptions

406
00:20:59,156 --> 00:21:00,626
Now, after some time has passed,

407
00:20:59,156 --> 00:21:00,626
Now, after some time has passed,

408
00:21:01,126 --> 00:21:03,106
we're ready to launch

409
00:21:03,376 --> 00:21:04,836
So, we get our marketing

410
00:21:04,836 --> 00:21:05,866
We do a big push.

411
00:21:06,426 --> 00:21:09,776
And we like to set our

412
00:21:11,196 --> 00:21:13,006
But, when we set

413
00:21:13,236 --> 00:21:15,256
we like to keep our

414
00:21:15,256 --> 00:21:16,376
because they've been loyal.

415
00:21:16,376 --> 00:21:17,436
They've been sticking with us.

416
00:21:17,956 --> 00:21:21,196
So, when this new price

417
00:21:22,116 --> 00:21:24,646
we'll have our launch

418
00:21:25,076 --> 00:21:26,756
for both new subscriptions

419
00:21:26,756 --> 00:21:30,416
And we'll have our early

420
00:21:31,026 --> 00:21:31,916
for their renewals.

421
00:21:33,726 --> 00:21:36,706
Now, some more time passes and

422
00:21:36,706 --> 00:21:38,916
up to a new target price

423
00:21:40,576 --> 00:21:43,076
This new price is 360 yen.

424
00:21:43,556 --> 00:21:46,556
But, this time when we want,

425
00:21:46,556 --> 00:21:50,026
into effect, we'd also like

426
00:21:50,506 --> 00:21:51,546
up to 360.

427
00:21:53,216 --> 00:21:54,836
So, we set that in

428
00:21:55,826 --> 00:21:59,246
And once this goes into

And we have early adopters

432
00:22:07,566 --> 00:22:10,466
Now, notice here that the

433
00:22:10,466 --> 00:22:11,526
prices increased.

434
00:22:11,746 --> 00:22:13,466
So, they do get a

435
00:22:15,586 --> 00:22:18,216
Finally we've reached the

436
00:22:18,876 --> 00:22:21,516
that we're ready to simplify our

437
00:22:21,516 --> 00:22:24,806
And we'd like to bring our

We go into iTunes Connect.

439
00:22:27,356 --> 00:22:28,796
We edit that price change.

440

And once we hit save, our

This change happens immediately,

that we plan for the future.

00:22:42,086 --> 00:22:46,126
Now, we have everybody paying

until we plan more

450
00:23:05,286 --> 00:23:08,206
What we've decided to do

451
00:23:08,206 --> 00:23:09,606
with the three phrase approach.

452
00:23:10,176 --> 00:23:12,986
So, when we launch a

453
00:23:12,986 --> 00:23:15,746
out with an initial price to

454
00:23:16,236 --> 00:23:18,106
And we're going to keep

455
00:23:18,866 --> 00:23:20,556
for a certain amount of time,

456
00:23:20,786 --> 00:23:22,196
then on our second

457
00:23:22,196 --> 00:23:23,316
to raise the price a little,

458
00:23:23,316 --> 00:23:27,526
but only do that in a

459
00:23:28,106 --> 00:23:31,026
And then lastly we're going

460
00:23:31,056 --> 00:23:33,706
that we want to sell our

461
00:23:34,226 --> 00:23:36,346
So, let's get started

462
00:23:36,386 --> 00:23:39,366
So, I want to go

463
00:23:40,056 --> 00:23:46,086
And dessert and entree

464
00:23:46,086 --> 00:23:47,156
that we're going

465
00:23:47,576 --> 00:23:49,636
So, I need to go in and set

466
00:23:50,676 --> 00:23:53,656
So, this again is our

467
00:23:53,966 --> 00:23:56,856
And I can click into the

468
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:01,306
So, again this is our new

469
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:01,306
So, again this is our new

470
00:24:01,506 --> 00:24:03,546
We have the reference

471
00:24:04,926 --> 00:24:08,646
We have a subscription

472
00:24:09,596 --> 00:24:11,666
We have the price

473
00:24:11,936 --> 00:24:13,496
And I'll come back to

474
00:24:13,496 --> 00:24:14,476
up our initial pricing.

475
00:24:14,826 --> 00:24:20,136
Again we have our

476
00:24:20,136 --> 00:24:23,046
And I can add additional

477
00:24:23,046 --> 00:24:26,036
to market this for

478
00:24:26,716 --> 00:24:30,266
And then our app store,

00:24:30,846 --> 00:24:35,456

presents itself within

And we can put in some

482
00:24:40,496 --> 00:24:45,156
notes there to help extra

483
00:24:46,106 --> 00:24:50,076
So, I'm going to go click on set

484
00:24:50,876 --> 00:24:52,086
to set up our initial pricing.

485
00:24:52,916 --> 00:24:54,646
So, my base currency

486
00:24:54,646 --> 00:24:57,436
And that can be set

487
00:24:57,436 --> 00:24:57,976

00:24:58,116 --> 00:25:02,406

495
00:25:14,696 --> 00:25:17,556
I have some additional licensing

496
00:25:17,556 --> 00:25:18,656
and I need to raise the price

497
00:25:18,656 --> 00:25:21,446
for that one particular

498
00:25:21,446 --> 00:25:25,526
and select this and move it

499
00:25:25,526 --> 00:25:28,926
And if I forget which

500
00:25:28,926 --> 00:25:30,606
that had been calculated

501
00:25:30,606 --> 00:25:31,366
and it will remind me.

502
00:25:32,376 --> 00:25:35,526
So, I'm going to scroll

503
00:25:35,526 --> 00:25:36,826

that will be our price

507

00:25:48,796 --> 00:25:55,736
And then go back to our

to our appetizer on

So, in this case we've

512
00:26:03,976 --> 00:26:05,876
We have some initial

513
00:26:06,266 --> 00:26:08,446
And I want to raise

514
00:26:08,446 --> 00:26:09,816
for our next phase of marketing.

515
00:26:10,756 --> 00:26:13,386
So, I'm going to click

516
00:26:14,576 --> 00:26:16,706
So, as I said in this case we're

517
00:26:16,736 --> 00:26:18,386
but only in a few

518
00:26:18,466 --> 00:26:21,546
So, I'm going to pick the

519
00:26:22,476 --> 00:26:26,886
Italy, Spain, and France.

520
00:26:27,976 --> 00:26:29,216
And then click on next.

521
00:26:29,776 --> 00:26:35,956
The price, the date for this

522
00:26:36,506 --> 00:26:40,126
And again, my base

523
00:26:40,126 --> 00:26:44,056
And I'm going to make the

524
00:26:45,026 --> 00:26:46,086
And then click on next.

525
00:26:46,776 --> 00:26:49,916
So, again these are the

526
00:26:49,916 --> 00:26:51,876
based on my base

527
00:26:52,106 --> 00:26:54,236
And I can see here what

528
00:26:54,416 --> 00:26:57,826
You know, we originally selected

529
00:26:57,886 --> 00:27:00,756
And the new price will be $1.99.

530
00:26:57,886 --> 00:27:00,756
And the new price will be $1.99.

531
00:27:00,986 --> 00:27:04,046
And then I'll click

532
00:27:04,866 --> 00:27:07,486
And here's where we're

533
00:27:07,486 --> 00:27:08,706
with our existing subscribers.

534
00:27:09,106 --> 00:27:11,736

00:27:11,736 --> 00:27:13,706
at the price that they

536
00:27:14,076 --> 00:27:18,046
And this change will be for

537
00:27:18,046 --> 00:27:20,676
on starting from the date

538
00:27:22,436 --> 00:27:23,756
So, I'm going to click on done.

539
00:27:25,436 --> 00:27:27,996
And that change will go

540
00:27:27,996 --> 00:27:29,216
That's the date that I selected.

541
00:27:29,916 --> 00:27:30,946
And click okay.

for this subscription.

that it goes into effect.

to our entree only subscription.

to apply this to

00:28:40,336 --> 00:28:44,156
And I can see that the last

566
00:28:44,156 --> 00:28:44,626
on March 18th.

567
00:28:45,856 --> 00:28:48,486
And our new price is

568
00:28:49,246 --> 00:28:50,706
So, I've clicked

569
00:28:51,346 --> 00:28:57,556
Now in this case for our

570
00:28:57,706 --> 00:29:01,006
the last price change, I want to

571
00:28:57,706 --> 00:29:01,006
the last price change, I want to

572
00:29:01,096 --> 00:29:03,556
after that point up

573
00:29:03,836 --> 00:29:06,336
But, we're still going to keep

574
00:29:06,336 --> 00:29:09,206
renewing at that original

575
00:29:09,236 --> 00:29:10,836
So, this change I only want

576
00:29:10,836 --> 00:29:14,826
to affect just the existing

577
00:29:14,876 --> 00:29:16,116
that last price change.

578
00:29:16,506 --> 00:29:19,886
So, in this case I'm going

579
00:29:19,886 --> 00:29:21,066
to existing subscribers.

580
00:29:22,446 --> 00:29:24,266
And I've applied it

581
00:29:24,266 --> 00:29:26,796
But, I can go and select

582
00:29:26,796 --> 00:29:28,486
that this would apply

583
00:29:29,366 --> 00:29:31,456
And I can see here, it

584
00:29:31,636 --> 00:29:34,756
$1.99 subscribers

585
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:36,916
And that is what I want to do.

586
00:29:36,916 --> 00:29:38,436
So, I'm going to click on next.

587
00:29:38,966 --> 00:29:43,966
And it's important to note that

588
00:29:43,966 --> 00:29:45,566
into effect it cannot

589
00:29:46,216 --> 00:29:50,736
And once it does go into effect,

590
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:54,476
that will have their price

591
00:29:54,476 --> 00:29:55,266
that their price has changed.

592
00:29:55,266 --> 00:29:56,406
And they will need to consent

593
00:29:56,406 --> 00:29:58,936
to that higher price before

594
00:29:59,636 --> 00:30:01,976
So, that is what we want to do.

595
00:29:59,636 --> 00:30:01,976
So, that is what we want to do.

596
00:30:02,046 --> 00:30:04,986
So, I'm going to go ahead and

597
00:30:05,346 --> 00:30:10,056
and then click done,

598
00:30:10,416 --> 00:30:14,146
So, once this price change

599
00:30:14,146 --> 00:30:16,346
you won't be able to

600
00:30:16,346 --> 00:30:18,296
But, we can edit it

601
00:30:18,386 --> 00:30:19,426
that it goes into effect.

602
00:30:20,646 --> 00:30:25,336
So, I'm going to select save

603
00:30:25,336 --> 00:30:26,816
to our subscription group page.

604
00:30:27,286 --> 00:30:29,166
And for our last task

605
00:30:29,166 --> 00:30:30,576
at our full course subscription.

606
00:30:34,406 --> 00:30:38,116
So, now in this case we have hit

607
00:30:38,406 --> 00:30:42,576
And it's time to move those

608
00:30:42,576 --> 00:30:44,886
so we can simplify the

609
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:48,126
So, I want us to take a

610
00:30:48,126 --> 00:30:49,846
I want to click on the

611
00:30:50,326 --> 00:30:53,396
And I can see that

612
00:30:53,396 --> 00:30:56,096
for new subscribers is $4.99.

613
00:30:56,096 --> 00:30:58,116
And I can even see

614
00:30:58,196 --> 00:31:00,016
for the first year

615
00:30:58,196 --> 00:31:00,016
for the first year

616
00:31:00,016 --> 00:31:02,746
And if they stay

617
00:31:02,746 --> 00:31:06,216
or more I can see what my

618
00:31:06,216 --> 00:31:08,906
So, I'm going to click on done.

619
00:31:10,316 --> 00:31:14,156
But, what I want to do is raise

620
00:31:14,466 --> 00:31:16,406
So, I'm going to click

621
00:31:17,066 --> 00:31:19,586
And here I can see that these

622
00:31:19,586 --> 00:31:21,716
So, we want to move them up.

623
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:24,636
So, I'm going to click on

624
00:31:26,066 --> 00:31:28,746
And here I can see

625
00:31:28,746 --> 00:31:31,606
And that the current is $4.99.

626
00:31:31,606 --> 00:31:34,456
So, I'm going to click

627
00:31:34,906 --> 00:31:36,406
That will apply it

628
00:31:36,666 --> 00:31:39,366
And again, if I need to I can

629
00:31:39,366 --> 00:31:42,506
to apply this to if I

630
00:31:42,506 --> 00:31:46,196
So, here it says 99 cent

631
00:31:46,196 --> 00:31:48,466
That will simplify a pricing

632
00:31:49,006 --> 00:31:50,516
So, I'm going to go

633
00:31:52,006 --> 00:31:54,476
Now in this case, the

634
00:31:54,556 --> 00:31:55,686
effect immediately.

635
00:31:56,086 --> 00:31:58,176
So, as soon as I

636
00:31:58,296 --> 00:31:59,836
It cannot be edited or changed.

637
00:32:00,356 --> 00:32:03,866
So, they will, and when

638
00:32:04,466 --> 00:32:06,826
when it's time for them to renew

639
00:32:07,026 --> 00:32:11,546
You know, the consent request

640
00:32:11,546 --> 00:32:13,896
for this subscription

641
00:32:13,896 --> 00:32:14,786
automatically renew.

642
00:32:15,976 --> 00:32:17,046
And that is what we want to do.

643
00:32:17,316 --> 00:32:18,586
So, I'm going to go ahead

644
00:32:18,586 --> 00:32:24,486
and select the check box

645
00:32:25,916 --> 00:32:28,796
And then click on okay.

646
00:32:28,796 --> 00:32:32,576
And now we have one price

647
00:32:32,826 --> 00:32:35,216
So, once I click save

648
00:32:35,216 --> 00:32:36,906
and it will not be

649
00:32:37,446 --> 00:32:39,976
And that is territory pricing.
