00:00:28,546 --> 00:00:29,536
&gt;&gt; Hello, everybody.

4
00:00:30,046 --> 00:00:32,016
Thank you for coming out

5
00:00:32,016 --> 00:00:34,046
and spending your

6
00:00:34,286 --> 00:00:36,676
Hopefully you had a

7
00:00:36,676 --> 00:00:43,596
And I'm excited for our talk

8
00:00:43,596 --> 00:00:47,206
to discuss something

9
00:00:48,326 --> 00:00:50,686
Fundamentally, everybody is here

10
00:00:50,686 --> 00:00:54,006
because you love

11
00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:58,496
and you probably want those

12
00:00:59,206 --> 00:01:04,556
Now, the good news is, we want

13
00:00:59,206 --> 00:01:04,556
Now, the good news is, we want

14
00:01:04,635 --> 00:01:07,686
to offer your app at the

15
00:01:07,956 --> 00:01:10,206
so that you get more engagement.

16
00:01:10,586 --> 00:01:14,646
And we're going to spend the

17
00:01:14,956 --> 00:01:19,176
about different ways

18
00:01:19,326 --> 00:01:22,126
We promote apps in

19
00:01:22,236 --> 00:01:25,416
throughout the operating system

20
00:01:26,476 --> 00:01:29,786
Siri app suggestions are

21
00:01:29,786 --> 00:01:31,476
when they swipe left from home,

22
00:01:31,476 --> 00:01:33,646
as well as when they

23
00:01:35,196 --> 00:01:38,056
Even after entering a

24
00:01:38,116 --> 00:01:41,996
from inside other

25
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:47,576
Handoff is another way we

26
00:01:47,576 --> 00:01:48,786
your apps, as well.

27
00:01:49,086 --> 00:01:52,996
As you start an activity from

28
00:01:53,366 --> 00:01:57,136
we try to anticipate what

29
00:01:57,136 --> 00:02:01,706
that app's icon in the bottom

30
00:01:57,136 --> 00:02:01,706
that app's icon in the bottom

31
00:02:01,886 --> 00:02:04,926
In certain situations, where

32
00:02:04,926 --> 00:02:09,406
to do is play a form of media,

33
00:02:09,406 --> 00:02:10,886
to the lock screen

34
00:02:11,306 --> 00:02:15,776
So say after you plug in a

35
00:02:15,966 --> 00:02:19,786
to your car or your

36
00:02:19,786 --> 00:02:21,986
that you usually use

37
00:02:22,026 --> 00:02:24,906
the system will learn that, and

38
00:02:24,906 --> 00:02:26,286
but that app's content.

39
00:02:26,286 --> 00:02:27,596
And we're going to talk today

40
00:02:27,836 --> 00:02:33,476
about how you can build a great

41
00:02:33,476 --> 00:02:35,616
As you're using the

42
00:02:35,616 --> 00:02:39,416
say reading a news article,

43
00:02:39,416 --> 00:02:42,966
that are contextual to the

44
00:02:42,966 --> 00:02:44,836
So for example, if

45
00:02:44,836 --> 00:02:48,246
and you decide that you want to

46
00:02:48,246 --> 00:02:50,616
or you want to read it at home

47
00:02:50,616 --> 00:02:54,476
of watching a WWDC presentation,

48
00:02:55,046 --> 00:02:59,706
And Siri will understand

49
00:02:59,706 --> 00:03:00,976
"Remind me about this."

50
00:02:59,706 --> 00:03:00,976
"Remind me about this."

51
00:03:01,036 --> 00:03:04,956
It will have the context of

52
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:08,786
And this will work in any app

53
00:03:08,786 --> 00:03:10,556
that we're going to

54
00:03:10,556 --> 00:03:14,206
This is particularly exciting

55
00:03:14,206 --> 00:03:16,956
that when customers

56
00:03:17,496 --> 00:03:20,946
they'll be de-blinked right

57
00:03:21,436 --> 00:03:24,826
New in iOS 10 is the promotion

58
00:03:24,826 --> 00:03:27,856
of locations throughout

59
00:03:28,026 --> 00:03:31,666
when we think the customer has

60
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:34,016
to go somewhere, to

61
00:03:34,276 --> 00:03:35,956
that they've been

62
00:03:36,206 --> 00:03:37,466
We'll be talking later today

63
00:03:37,466 --> 00:03:42,296
about how you can get your app's

64
00:03:44,696 --> 00:03:47,816
Multitasking as well

65
00:03:48,056 --> 00:03:51,506
where we will promote locations

66
00:03:51,506 --> 00:03:52,166
interested in.

67
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:56,916
You can get your app, your

68
00:03:56,916 --> 00:03:59,986
at the prime real estate

69
00:04:00,696 --> 00:04:06,206
New in iOS 10 as

70
00:04:06,206 --> 00:04:09,496
of your app's contact

71
00:04:09,846 --> 00:04:13,426
within the native contact app.

72
00:04:14,376 --> 00:04:18,706
So you notice here, there's

73
00:04:18,706 --> 00:04:19,276
in WhatsApp.

74
00:04:19,276 --> 00:04:21,305
And we'll talk later today

75
00:04:21,305 --> 00:04:24,856
about how you can get your

76
00:04:27,216 --> 00:04:33,566
So, to learn when to promote

77
00:04:33,616 --> 00:04:37,476
to learn about your

78
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:43,446
Now, the good news is that a few

79
00:04:43,446 --> 00:04:45,936
of the value that I

80
00:04:47,096 --> 00:04:50,256
In addition to having your

81
00:04:50,366 --> 00:04:53,596
you'll also get deeper Siri

82
00:04:54,426 --> 00:04:56,266
with the contextual reminders.

83
00:04:56,266 --> 00:04:59,896
So what we're going to do

84
00:04:59,896 --> 00:05:02,586
about these APIs and

85
00:04:59,896 --> 00:05:02,586
about these APIs and

86
00:05:02,656 --> 00:05:07,006
through proper adoption of

87
00:05:07,006 --> 00:05:10,686
up getting more engagement

88
00:05:10,686 --> 00:05:12,666
to promotion throughout the OS.

89
00:05:12,986 --> 00:05:16,976
First, we're going to talk about

90
00:05:17,586 --> 00:05:21,266
NSUserActivity is the kind

91
00:05:21,266 --> 00:05:22,396
of the operating system.

92
00:05:22,396 --> 00:05:26,376
It helps us understand what the

93
00:05:26,376 --> 00:05:27,836
at on screen.

94
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:33,566
And schema.org is somewhat

95
00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:36,126
Next, we're going to talk

96
00:05:36,126 --> 00:05:39,146
and new APIs around apps

97
00:05:39,186 --> 00:05:42,756
So if you're an app like

98
00:05:43,096 --> 00:05:45,476
that offers many different

99
00:05:45,476 --> 00:05:48,246
if you're an app like Uber

100
00:05:48,286 --> 00:05:50,426
this will be very

101
00:05:51,036 --> 00:05:54,016
Then we'll talk about

102
00:05:54,016 --> 00:05:55,646
around media apps suggestions.

103
00:05:56,006 --> 00:06:00,146
I showed you earlier an example

104
00:05:56,006 --> 00:06:00,146
I showed you earlier an example

105
00:06:00,146 --> 00:06:02,666
that will happen, say

106
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:04,266
in their headphones,

107
00:06:04,266 --> 00:06:06,566
about how you can get

108
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:07,906
and center in that interface.

109
00:06:08,656 --> 00:06:10,446
And then, we'll try to overview

110
00:06:10,476 --> 00:06:12,366
about all the different things

111
00:06:12,946 --> 00:06:17,846
To kick things off with

112
00:06:17,846 --> 00:06:20,106
I'd love to invite

113
00:06:20,286 --> 00:06:20,606
Sofiane?

115
00:06:27,196 --> 00:06:27,636
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Daniel.

116
00:06:28,076 --> 00:06:29,636
Good afternoon everyone.

117
00:06:29,866 --> 00:06:30,816
My name is Sofiane.

118
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:33,346
And I'm really excited to

119
00:06:33,346 --> 00:06:35,666
about some of the features

120
00:06:37,046 --> 00:06:39,596
Now, we just heard Daniel

121
00:06:39,596 --> 00:06:42,346
to promote the content in your

122
00:06:43,116 --> 00:06:44,806
Now let's talk about

123
00:06:44,876 --> 00:06:47,086
that you can adopt

124
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:49,796
Throughout this presentation,

125
00:06:50,716 --> 00:06:53,456
Some that you may be already

126
00:06:53,456 --> 00:06:56,506
or Spotlight Search, and some

127
00:06:56,506 --> 00:06:59,226
in iOS 10, like location

128
00:07:00,246 --> 00:07:02,216
Now all of the features

129
00:07:02,456 --> 00:07:03,346
have something in common.

130
00:07:03,976 --> 00:07:07,016
And it's a single API

131
00:07:07,876 --> 00:07:10,146
First, some background.

132
00:07:10,146 --> 00:07:13,576
NSUserActivity was introduced

133
00:07:13,996 --> 00:07:15,696
which is the amazing

134
00:07:15,696 --> 00:07:18,586
to start an activity on a

135
00:07:18,586 --> 00:07:19,786
where you left off on another.

136
00:07:20,276 --> 00:07:23,866
Last year in iOS

137
00:07:23,866 --> 00:07:26,476
to promote content directly

138
00:07:26,476 --> 00:07:29,886
from NSUserActivity inside

139
00:07:30,556 --> 00:07:34,476
Now, this year in iOS 10, we

140
00:07:34,756 --> 00:07:37,906
so it can capture locations

141
00:07:38,266 --> 00:07:40,556
and promote them in many

142
00:07:41,006 --> 00:07:42,786
Even inside other apps.

143
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:46,606
NSUserActivity now also

144
00:07:47,116 --> 00:07:50,706
so Siri can now help you get

145
00:07:50,706 --> 00:07:53,566
to the place you're

146
00:07:53,846 --> 00:07:54,896
Also new in iOS 10,

147
00:07:55,576 --> 00:07:58,316
NSUserActivity enables

148
00:07:58,706 --> 00:08:00,806
to be promoted straight

149
00:07:58,706 --> 00:08:00,806
to be promoted straight

150
00:08:00,806 --> 00:08:02,536
as an alternate communication

151
00:08:03,086 --> 00:08:05,556
Now, I know what you

152
00:08:06,036 --> 00:08:07,396
"That's cool," hopefully.

153
00:08:08,006 --> 00:08:10,146
"But how does this work?"

154
00:08:10,836 --> 00:08:12,846
Well, let me tell you,

155
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:14,766
and we have a lot of great

156
00:08:14,766 --> 00:08:15,956
So let's dive right in.

157
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:20,016
We're going to talk about

158
00:08:20,736 --> 00:08:22,386
These APIs allow you

159
00:08:22,386 --> 00:08:24,306
to seamlessly integrate

160
00:08:24,766 --> 00:08:28,396
NSUserActivity for native apps,

161
00:08:29,266 --> 00:08:30,806
We'll focus on the

162
00:08:32,066 --> 00:08:34,946
NSUserActivity is a

163
00:08:35,076 --> 00:08:39,285
to capture application state

164
00:08:39,376 --> 00:08:41,006
in a way that can

165
00:08:41,806 --> 00:08:44,476
So for instance, here we're

166
00:08:44,476 --> 00:08:47,736
which is a local search app,

167
00:08:48,326 --> 00:08:51,126
we created an NSUserActivity

168
00:08:51,126 --> 00:08:53,046
that we need to recreate

169
00:08:54,036 --> 00:08:56,396
So for instance, when I trigger

170
00:08:56,826 --> 00:08:59,066
we follow the same pattern

171
00:08:59,796 --> 00:09:03,126
And again, when I actually

172
00:08:59,796 --> 00:09:03,126
And again, when I actually

173
00:09:04,186 --> 00:09:07,156
Now, in this particular case,

174
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:11,486
In iOS 10, NSUserActivity

175
00:09:11,486 --> 00:09:14,166
about certain concepts

176
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:15,806
or communication interactions.

177
00:09:16,516 --> 00:09:18,326
We'll talk about this in a

178
00:09:18,326 --> 00:09:20,176
to take a closer

179
00:09:21,746 --> 00:09:24,886
So here we create an activity

180
00:09:24,886 --> 00:09:27,756
to recreate the state later,

181
00:09:27,756 --> 00:09:30,876
For instance, the

182
00:09:31,656 --> 00:09:32,706
Then we inform the system

183
00:09:32,706 --> 00:09:35,026
that this represents

184
00:09:35,536 --> 00:09:38,646
and we decide whether it will

185
00:09:39,816 --> 00:09:41,846
available temporarily

186
00:09:41,846 --> 00:09:42,956
for location suggestions.

187
00:09:43,956 --> 00:09:45,986
Or added to the on

188
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:50,466
or added to the Spotlight on

189
00:09:50,466 --> 00:09:51,526
in Spotlight Search results.

190
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:55,096
Now there are a few related

191
00:09:55,096 --> 00:09:57,876
specifically on adoption

192
00:09:57,876 --> 00:09:59,226
for Handoff and App Search.

193
00:09:59,706 --> 00:10:01,306
Really recommend that you

194
00:09:59,706 --> 00:10:01,306
Really recommend that you

195
00:10:01,306 --> 00:10:03,966
They provide a lot

196
00:10:04,126 --> 00:10:05,546
Alright, now let's dig

197
00:10:05,986 --> 00:10:08,706
So, I'm going to show you how

198
00:10:09,806 --> 00:10:12,446
So here we're extenuating an

199
00:10:12,926 --> 00:10:15,006
And providing it with

200
00:10:15,006 --> 00:10:16,536
That's the string

201
00:10:16,676 --> 00:10:19,576
It's the same string that you

202
00:10:20,776 --> 00:10:23,186
Now we recommend to use a

203
00:10:23,186 --> 00:10:24,486
here to keep the strings unique.

204
00:10:24,486 --> 00:10:28,596
Next, our activity needs

205
00:10:28,596 --> 00:10:31,416
to use a title that describes

206
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:31,796
at here.

207
00:10:32,096 --> 00:10:33,256
So here we're looking

208
00:10:33,646 --> 00:10:36,736
And something to keep in mind

209
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:37,746
of your user activities.

210
00:10:38,056 --> 00:10:40,066
This is how, for instance,

211
00:10:40,066 --> 00:10:41,206
in Spotlight Search results.

212
00:10:41,586 --> 00:10:42,966
So you want to make

213
00:10:42,966 --> 00:10:44,686
that is descriptive

214
00:10:46,096 --> 00:10:49,246
Next, we're enabling Handoff,

215
00:10:49,686 --> 00:10:51,356
since the content we're

216
00:10:52,016 --> 00:10:55,286
And then we're setting

217
00:10:55,286 --> 00:10:58,016
on the userInfo property,

218
00:10:58,016 --> 00:10:59,886
that we need to recreate

219
00:11:00,086 --> 00:11:01,366
when the activity is restored.

220
00:11:01,946 --> 00:11:04,326
Now in that case,

221
00:11:04,326 --> 00:11:07,466
of that location we were

222
00:11:07,726 --> 00:11:09,746
when the activity is being

223
00:11:09,746 --> 00:11:13,276
when it's handed off to another

224
00:11:13,276 --> 00:11:16,016
that ID from the server

225
00:11:16,236 --> 00:11:17,776
as the user would expect.

226
00:11:18,896 --> 00:11:20,686
Now to fully describe

227
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:22,546
and for richer search results,

228
00:11:22,846 --> 00:11:24,756
you can use this

229
00:11:24,756 --> 00:11:27,826
in iOS 9 called CSSearchableItem

230
00:11:29,056 --> 00:11:33,186
It provides a common language

231
00:11:33,216 --> 00:11:35,916
to describe your content better.

232
00:11:36,096 --> 00:11:39,066
Now, if you have a website

233
00:11:39,386 --> 00:11:40,936
that you're looking

234
00:11:41,486 --> 00:11:45,946
can provide the web URL so

235
00:11:45,946 --> 00:11:47,986
for instance, handed

236
00:11:47,986 --> 00:11:49,256
where your app is not installed,

237
00:11:49,546 --> 00:11:51,516
it will be appropriately

238
00:11:52,026 --> 00:11:53,716
in Safari instead,

239
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:57,786
And finally, we call

240
00:11:58,136 --> 00:11:59,166
indicating to the system

241
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:01,216
that this represents

242
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:01,216
that this represents

243
00:12:01,396 --> 00:12:03,286
This is what the user is

244
00:12:04,986 --> 00:12:07,516
Now, what happens when your

245
00:12:07,516 --> 00:12:09,546
When your activity is being

246
00:12:09,846 --> 00:12:12,316
Or handed off to another device?

247
00:12:13,506 --> 00:12:15,756
Your application is

248
00:12:16,276 --> 00:12:18,676
and a UIApplication

249
00:12:19,016 --> 00:12:21,626
called continueUserActivity

250
00:12:22,426 --> 00:12:24,766
The first thing we need to do

251
00:12:25,316 --> 00:12:27,456
and make sure that it

252
00:12:27,966 --> 00:12:29,076
That case matches the one

253
00:12:29,076 --> 00:12:30,406
that we were just

254
00:12:31,066 --> 00:12:32,786
And then we can use the

255
00:12:32,786 --> 00:12:33,956
to start restoring the state.

256
00:12:34,556 --> 00:12:38,026
Earlier, we had put the

257
00:12:38,026 --> 00:12:40,746
So typically here, we would

258
00:12:40,746 --> 00:12:43,166
from the server and

259
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:46,286
and display the right controller

260
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:49,916
So with minimal code here,

261
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:52,846
from three great features;

262
00:12:52,846 --> 00:12:54,476
and contextual Siri reminders.

263
00:12:55,676 --> 00:12:58,056
Now, we'll talk about some of

264
00:12:59,206 --> 00:13:00,286
Before, let me ask you this.

265
00:12:59,206 --> 00:13:00,286
Before, let me ask you this.

266
00:13:00,976 --> 00:13:03,406
Have you ever been in a

267
00:13:03,596 --> 00:13:05,766
and you're trying to find

268
00:13:06,516 --> 00:13:08,916
So you start in Yelp and

269
00:13:09,586 --> 00:13:10,596
Then you want to

270
00:13:10,596 --> 00:13:11,466
so that they can meet you there.

271
00:13:12,156 --> 00:13:14,306
So you switch to

272
00:13:14,556 --> 00:13:15,826
"Hey guys, I found this place."

273
00:13:15,826 --> 00:13:17,726
But then you realize you don't

274
00:13:17,726 --> 00:13:19,666
of that place, so you

275
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,226
you copy the address, then

276
00:13:22,226 --> 00:13:25,376
You paste it in there, and

277
00:13:26,186 --> 00:13:27,956
Except you're not,

278
00:13:28,086 --> 00:13:29,336
you're also going to

279
00:13:29,546 --> 00:13:31,026
So you're going to

280
00:13:31,376 --> 00:13:32,916
and there's probably more

281
00:13:33,336 --> 00:13:34,856
And you get the idea.

282
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:36,006
It's not a great experience.

283
00:13:38,976 --> 00:13:40,216
So in iOS 10, we're trying

284
00:13:40,216 --> 00:13:42,216
to make this experience

285
00:13:43,106 --> 00:13:44,606
You still start at a same point.

286
00:13:44,786 --> 00:13:45,806
You're looking at a location,

287
00:13:45,806 --> 00:13:48,516
say a restaurant,

288
00:13:48,516 --> 00:13:51,916
And by adopting NSUserActivity,

289
00:13:52,016 --> 00:13:54,786
that same location in many

290
00:13:54,786 --> 00:13:55,206
the system.

291
00:13:56,086 --> 00:13:57,426
When you switch away

292
00:13:57,996 --> 00:14:00,686
the multitasking UI

293
00:13:57,996 --> 00:14:00,686
the multitasking UI

294
00:14:00,686 --> 00:14:03,416
and offers this nice proactive

295
00:14:03,866 --> 00:14:06,866
offering to get directions

296
00:14:07,306 --> 00:14:08,566
to the place you

297
00:14:09,136 --> 00:14:11,896
If you go to Messages,

298
00:14:12,316 --> 00:14:14,826
You can start writing

299
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:17,886
" and the QuickType UI

300
00:14:17,886 --> 00:14:21,306
that location directly into

301
00:14:21,306 --> 00:14:22,006
that you're providing.

302
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:24,896
Same thing with Maps.

303
00:14:24,896 --> 00:14:27,796
Maps promotes these locations

304
00:14:28,126 --> 00:14:29,166
Not only in the Maps app,

305
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:31,426
but also in the new

306
00:14:31,766 --> 00:14:34,366
as well as in CarPlay which is

307
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:35,156
Imagine that.

308
00:14:35,556 --> 00:14:38,206
Look at your app, get in

309
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:39,386
that's it, you're done.

310
00:14:39,386 --> 00:14:40,236
You can be on your way.

311
00:14:42,196 --> 00:14:45,196
These locations can even be

312
00:14:45,436 --> 00:14:49,896
So what we're looking at here

313
00:14:49,896 --> 00:14:53,246
through NSUserActivity

314
00:14:53,466 --> 00:14:58,326
as the user engages with

315
00:14:58,526 --> 00:15:00,456
Again, it also provides

316
00:14:58,526 --> 00:15:00,456
Again, it also provides

317
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:03,326
so you can now be looking

318
00:15:03,326 --> 00:15:05,776
to get you directions

319
00:15:05,776 --> 00:15:07,596
to the place you're looking at.

320
00:15:08,236 --> 00:15:12,626
So all of these features with

321
00:15:13,726 --> 00:15:15,936
And all of these features

322
00:15:16,726 --> 00:15:18,156
is that they all indicate

323
00:15:18,446 --> 00:15:21,086
where the suggestion is

324
00:15:21,496 --> 00:15:22,556
in that case from Yelp.

325
00:15:23,236 --> 00:15:25,046
Now imagine if this

326
00:15:25,556 --> 00:15:26,206
Wouldn't that be great?

327
00:15:27,156 --> 00:15:28,566
Well, this is possible now.

328
00:15:29,406 --> 00:15:33,766
NSUserActivity now allows you

329
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,026
that are viewed inside

330
00:15:35,076 --> 00:15:39,036
We're introducing new

331
00:15:39,126 --> 00:15:41,886
and CoreSpotlight, allowing

332
00:15:41,886 --> 00:15:43,996
with all of these places

333
00:15:44,486 --> 00:15:48,426
In terms of code, we're going

334
00:15:48,486 --> 00:15:50,486
and we're going to

335
00:15:50,486 --> 00:15:53,256
that we had defined earlier,

336
00:15:53,256 --> 00:15:55,196
We don't have to create

337
00:15:55,946 --> 00:15:58,996
So, for apps using

338
00:15:58,996 --> 00:16:02,746
as setting your MKMapItem to

339
00:15:58,996 --> 00:16:02,746
as setting your MKMapItem to

340
00:16:03,016 --> 00:16:06,076
defined as NSUserActivity.

341
00:16:06,996 --> 00:16:09,396
And that's pretty much it.

342
00:16:09,396 --> 00:16:11,066
This also has the

343
00:16:11,186 --> 00:16:14,146
of populating the

344
00:16:14,146 --> 00:16:16,286
for you automatically

345
00:16:16,286 --> 00:16:19,936
so if you want to adopt App

346
00:16:19,936 --> 00:16:22,036
to specify that you

347
00:16:22,296 --> 00:16:25,426
and these locations

348
00:16:25,586 --> 00:16:28,746
Now there's another way which is

349
00:16:29,296 --> 00:16:31,266
and for those of you who are

350
00:16:31,546 --> 00:16:33,666
you can use CSSearchableItem

351
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,166
and describe the location.

352
00:16:36,016 --> 00:16:37,326
Now, let's break this

353
00:16:37,626 --> 00:16:39,556
First thing we're doing

354
00:16:39,556 --> 00:16:42,296
of the location, which

355
00:16:42,786 --> 00:16:43,846
And that's required for all

356
00:16:43,846 --> 00:16:45,426
of the UIs we just

357
00:16:45,976 --> 00:16:49,386
Next, we're specifying the text

358
00:16:49,896 --> 00:16:52,236
and that's required for

359
00:16:52,236 --> 00:16:53,576
such as the keyboard,

360
00:16:53,996 --> 00:16:57,506
Next, we're specifying the

361
00:16:57,806 --> 00:16:59,426
That's optional,

362
00:16:59,426 --> 00:17:01,726
that your users are

363
00:16:59,426 --> 00:17:01,726
that your users are

364
00:17:01,726 --> 00:17:04,106
to the place you

365
00:17:04,596 --> 00:17:06,866
Latitude and longitude is the

366
00:17:06,866 --> 00:17:08,826
that you can use if you

367
00:17:09,276 --> 00:17:12,746
Next, we're setting the phone

368
00:17:12,746 --> 00:17:15,476
to get access to Siri

369
00:17:15,476 --> 00:17:16,616
"Call this place," for instance.

370
00:17:17,675 --> 00:17:19,576
And finally, we're indicating

371
00:17:19,576 --> 00:17:22,726
that this content supports

372
00:17:23,156 --> 00:17:27,096
This way, the results will be

373
00:17:27,096 --> 00:17:29,196
In Spotlight Search results UI,

374
00:17:29,606 --> 00:17:33,026
with the right quick action

375
00:17:33,266 --> 00:17:35,656
or get directions, for instance.

376
00:17:36,036 --> 00:17:37,696
That's how you get

377
00:17:37,696 --> 00:17:38,196
It's that easy.

378
00:17:38,586 --> 00:17:41,036
Now, your app is going

379
00:17:41,036 --> 00:17:41,876
of these different places.

380
00:17:42,676 --> 00:17:43,856
We think this is going

381
00:17:43,856 --> 00:17:47,226
to provide a much richer

382
00:17:47,226 --> 00:17:48,376
but also outside your app.

383
00:17:49,186 --> 00:17:52,106
Now, your brand can be further

384
00:17:52,616 --> 00:17:54,536
Not within the confinement

385
00:17:55,066 --> 00:17:57,856
Let's move on to

386
00:17:58,426 --> 00:18:03,606
IOS 10 DP integrates

387
00:17:58,426 --> 00:18:03,606
IOS 10 DP integrates

388
00:18:03,826 --> 00:18:04,686
from a contact card.

389
00:18:05,296 --> 00:18:07,936
So what we're looking at

390
00:18:07,936 --> 00:18:10,346
where the WhatsApp handle was

391
00:18:10,956 --> 00:18:14,516
When I go ahead and tap on the

392
00:18:14,516 --> 00:18:17,316
to send a message, I'm

393
00:18:17,316 --> 00:18:18,416
of contact I'd like to use.

394
00:18:19,196 --> 00:18:23,616
And if I do so, this choice can

395
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:25,336
as a default mean

396
00:18:25,876 --> 00:18:29,656
So your app can be promoted

397
00:18:29,656 --> 00:18:31,606
for messaging for

398
00:18:32,776 --> 00:18:35,646
That's also supported by

399
00:18:35,646 --> 00:18:36,996
with a new intense framework,

400
00:18:37,336 --> 00:18:38,746
which is the same

401
00:18:39,006 --> 00:18:40,596
to get deep Siri integration.

402
00:18:41,366 --> 00:18:43,456
There were two great talks about

403
00:18:43,976 --> 00:18:47,856
I really recommend that

404
00:18:47,856 --> 00:18:49,956
So here we're looking

405
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:52,076
sending a text message,

406
00:18:52,076 --> 00:18:53,576
to work on how this works.

407
00:18:53,576 --> 00:18:57,136
So the first thing we do is

408
00:18:57,136 --> 00:19:00,226
which is a new object we're

409
00:18:57,136 --> 00:19:00,226
which is a new object we're

410
00:19:01,636 --> 00:19:03,816
This contains information

411
00:19:04,556 --> 00:19:08,366
For instance, which

412
00:19:08,366 --> 00:19:11,346
So for instance, sending a text

413
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:14,746
as well as some other

414
00:19:14,746 --> 00:19:17,486
the sender, and some

415
00:19:17,486 --> 00:19:19,866
like whether the communication

416
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:24,826
Next, you call the Donate

417
00:19:25,216 --> 00:19:27,676
This way the system will

418
00:19:27,676 --> 00:19:30,736
and promote your app directly

419
00:19:32,036 --> 00:19:35,006
Now, when users interact

420
00:19:35,126 --> 00:19:37,306
through the contact card,

421
00:19:37,496 --> 00:19:40,146
Create an INInteraction

422
00:19:40,146 --> 00:19:40,636
trying to do.

423
00:19:41,116 --> 00:19:43,496
And wrap it up inside

424
00:19:43,836 --> 00:19:45,126
which your app is

425
00:19:45,886 --> 00:19:48,006
Now let's see how this

426
00:19:49,006 --> 00:19:49,786
The first thing here,

427
00:19:49,786 --> 00:19:51,816
we're creating the

428
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:55,126
And something to note is

429
00:19:55,126 --> 00:19:56,456
to the user's address book,

430
00:19:57,056 --> 00:20:01,336
you can specify what contact

431
00:19:57,056 --> 00:20:01,336
you can specify what contact

432
00:20:01,336 --> 00:20:01,766
with here.

433
00:20:02,116 --> 00:20:04,666
And this way the system will

434
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:06,816
out the right contact

435
00:20:08,596 --> 00:20:09,566
Next, we're creating intent.

436
00:20:10,226 --> 00:20:12,116
And here we're using

437
00:20:12,116 --> 00:20:13,436
since we're sending

438
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:16,076
Now there are three

439
00:20:16,076 --> 00:20:18,106
to you for sending

440
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:20,016
making audio, and video calls.

441
00:20:21,216 --> 00:20:23,656
Now it's important

442
00:20:23,656 --> 00:20:26,596
to also make sure you specify

443
00:20:26,596 --> 00:20:27,886
of handling in your info plist

444
00:20:28,246 --> 00:20:31,296
to that pretty much the same

445
00:20:31,296 --> 00:20:32,306
what we talked about earlier.

446
00:20:32,756 --> 00:20:35,876
Next, we'll provide the

447
00:20:35,946 --> 00:20:37,086
And here we're using WhatsApp.

448
00:20:37,086 --> 00:20:39,976
And this is particularly

449
00:20:39,976 --> 00:20:41,106
with multiple protocols.

450
00:20:41,276 --> 00:20:46,006
So for instance, if you

451
00:20:46,136 --> 00:20:48,846
which deals with both

452
00:20:49,196 --> 00:20:51,476
you'll want to make sure you

453
00:20:51,966 --> 00:20:56,836
Next, we create an INInteraction

454
00:20:56,836 --> 00:20:58,586
of the information

455
00:20:59,046 --> 00:21:00,766
And some metadata

456
00:20:59,046 --> 00:21:00,766
And some metadata

457
00:21:00,766 --> 00:21:02,786
like directionality

458
00:21:03,496 --> 00:21:05,106
Now since here we're

459
00:21:05,436 --> 00:21:06,966
we're using the outgoing

460
00:21:07,526 --> 00:21:09,866
and that's the only

461
00:21:10,056 --> 00:21:11,346
for donations of interactions.

462
00:21:12,356 --> 00:21:14,906
And finally, we donate this

463
00:21:15,536 --> 00:21:16,716
This way it will be --

464
00:21:16,816 --> 00:21:18,936
the system will be able

465
00:21:18,936 --> 00:21:24,626
to augment the contacts you're

466
00:21:24,886 --> 00:21:28,516
Now again, like I said, when

467
00:21:28,516 --> 00:21:30,886
from a contact card, we

468
00:21:31,226 --> 00:21:33,596
and use the same UI

469
00:21:34,066 --> 00:21:34,646
to launch your app.

470
00:21:35,246 --> 00:21:37,226
The first thing we're doing

471
00:21:37,486 --> 00:21:40,776
and interaction from

472
00:21:40,836 --> 00:21:42,916
and then we can start

473
00:21:43,256 --> 00:21:44,506
with the intended recipients.

474
00:21:44,876 --> 00:21:47,876
And that's how you get

475
00:21:48,446 --> 00:21:51,166
Now, your app can be promoted

476
00:21:51,566 --> 00:21:53,256
which is the most natural

477
00:21:54,576 --> 00:21:55,066
So we did it.

478
00:21:55,066 --> 00:21:56,416
We checked everything

479
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:57,546
But we're not done.

480
00:21:57,756 --> 00:21:59,156
We have some more to talk about.

481
00:21:59,816 --> 00:22:01,826
So let's talk about some

482
00:21:59,816 --> 00:22:01,826
So let's talk about some

483
00:22:01,826 --> 00:22:04,156
in mind while working

484
00:22:04,876 --> 00:22:06,986
The first thing is to be lazy.

485
00:22:07,586 --> 00:22:08,286
Okay, now we're talking.

486
00:22:09,176 --> 00:22:12,446
So, imagine you're working in a

487
00:22:12,446 --> 00:22:15,456
to adopt Handoff so

488
00:22:15,456 --> 00:22:19,666
to start writing an email on

489
00:22:19,756 --> 00:22:21,726
where they left off on

490
00:22:21,726 --> 00:22:22,536
on the go for instance.

491
00:22:23,386 --> 00:22:25,156
So here what we're doing

492
00:22:25,456 --> 00:22:28,456
that is called every

493
00:22:28,456 --> 00:22:28,996
on the keyboard.

494
00:22:29,626 --> 00:22:31,706
And every single

495
00:22:31,766 --> 00:22:33,396
and update the userinfo

496
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:36,246
Now that can be costly

497
00:22:36,846 --> 00:22:40,036
So instead what you should do is

498
00:22:40,406 --> 00:22:43,346
indicating to the system

499
00:22:43,766 --> 00:22:47,216
And then this way, the system

500
00:22:47,216 --> 00:22:50,026
at an opportune time to update

501
00:22:50,736 --> 00:22:54,026
For instance, right before the

502
00:22:54,186 --> 00:22:54,896
to another device.

503
00:22:56,096 --> 00:22:57,396
Now here, this is

504
00:22:57,436 --> 00:23:01,476
and we're implementing the

505
00:22:57,436 --> 00:23:01,476
and we're implementing the

506
00:23:01,476 --> 00:23:03,176
method, and this

507
00:23:03,176 --> 00:23:04,986
to update the userinfo

508
00:23:05,836 --> 00:23:07,386
This way we can do it only once

509
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:10,756
and we're way more

510
00:23:10,986 --> 00:23:12,856
Next, make sure you

511
00:23:12,946 --> 00:23:13,846
to the current activity.

512
00:23:14,696 --> 00:23:17,686
So what we're doing here is

513
00:23:18,166 --> 00:23:21,566
doing a bunch of things to it,

514
00:23:21,736 --> 00:23:22,166
So that's good.

515
00:23:22,596 --> 00:23:24,916
Except after that, we're not

516
00:23:24,916 --> 00:23:25,896
and exiting the function.

517
00:23:26,406 --> 00:23:27,796
And therefore, the

518
00:23:27,956 --> 00:23:30,546
because it goes out of scope.

519
00:23:30,726 --> 00:23:32,086
An activity release

520
00:23:32,086 --> 00:23:32,896
because it doesn't exist.

521
00:23:33,536 --> 00:23:36,196
So instead what you should

522
00:23:36,506 --> 00:23:37,496
to the current activity.

523
00:23:38,116 --> 00:23:40,816
If you're dealing with

524
00:23:40,816 --> 00:23:42,806
that conforms to a UI responder,

525
00:23:43,226 --> 00:23:45,496
can also use the User

526
00:23:45,666 --> 00:23:48,346
User Activity Property,

527
00:23:48,816 --> 00:23:50,396
And this has the great effect

528
00:23:50,396 --> 00:23:53,786
of having UIKit manage the

529
00:23:54,096 --> 00:23:57,106
So you don't have to call

530
00:23:57,676 --> 00:23:59,686
UIKit does it for you

531
00:23:59,686 --> 00:24:02,036
for instance are linked

532
00:23:59,686 --> 00:24:02,036
for instance are linked

533
00:24:03,456 --> 00:24:05,246
Next, transfer a small payload.

534
00:24:05,246 --> 00:24:08,626
So make sure that you keep

535
00:24:08,626 --> 00:24:10,026
in your userinfo dictionary,

536
00:24:10,266 --> 00:24:12,176
to recreate the states,

537
00:24:12,716 --> 00:24:16,916
And remember that these user

538
00:24:17,326 --> 00:24:20,096
over the air, by Bluetooth, so

539
00:24:20,096 --> 00:24:21,156
as lightweight as possible.

540
00:24:21,726 --> 00:24:25,526
So for instance, imagine you're

541
00:24:25,526 --> 00:24:27,976
with large photos

542
00:24:28,746 --> 00:24:31,526
So what we're doing here is

543
00:24:31,836 --> 00:24:33,576
serializing them as

544
00:24:33,576 --> 00:24:34,606
in the userinfo dictionary,

545
00:24:35,136 --> 00:24:37,496
which could be very

546
00:24:37,606 --> 00:24:38,346
which is not efficient.

547
00:24:39,226 --> 00:24:43,926
Instead what you can do is try

548
00:24:43,926 --> 00:24:48,206
to that content you're working

549
00:24:48,566 --> 00:24:50,516
this way when you're

550
00:24:50,516 --> 00:24:52,816
you can maybe fetch

551
00:24:53,046 --> 00:24:54,446
or obtain it through

552
00:24:55,726 --> 00:24:57,466
Now if you really have to

553
00:24:57,466 --> 00:24:59,036
you can use continuation

554
00:24:59,376 --> 00:25:01,596
and these are specifically

555
00:24:59,376 --> 00:25:01,596
and these are specifically

556
00:25:01,876 --> 00:25:03,236
There's a ton of

557
00:25:03,586 --> 00:25:05,036
in the developer documentation.

558
00:25:05,986 --> 00:25:08,096
Okay, one more.

559
00:25:08,326 --> 00:25:11,576
Make sure you keep your activity

560
00:25:12,016 --> 00:25:13,206
And that's to avoid collisions.

561
00:25:13,566 --> 00:25:14,416
But it's also important

562
00:25:14,416 --> 00:25:16,926
that they represent the

563
00:25:17,096 --> 00:25:18,536
or the current user actions.

564
00:25:19,646 --> 00:25:21,596
So instead of having a

565
00:25:22,126 --> 00:25:23,726
that I reuse everywhere

566
00:25:24,556 --> 00:25:27,456
it's good to have multiple

567
00:25:27,456 --> 00:25:28,396
different parts of my app.

568
00:25:28,616 --> 00:25:30,956
So for instance, one when

569
00:25:31,296 --> 00:25:33,066
one when I'm searching

570
00:25:34,146 --> 00:25:35,736
and what you'll notice

571
00:25:35,736 --> 00:25:40,776
that I'm using a reverse DNS

572
00:25:40,776 --> 00:25:44,326
that there's no collision

573
00:25:44,546 --> 00:25:46,546
that might have been

574
00:25:47,106 --> 00:25:49,126
Alright, time for a demo now.

575
00:25:49,286 --> 00:25:52,066
So we're going to use

576
00:25:52,306 --> 00:25:54,406
which is a sample we're

577
00:25:54,406 --> 00:25:55,326
on the Developer Library.

578
00:25:56,086 --> 00:25:59,146
And we'll see how we

579
00:25:59,146 --> 00:26:00,216
to promote locations.

580
00:25:59,146 --> 00:26:00,216
to promote locations.

581
00:26:00,876 --> 00:26:04,266
We'll also briefly touch on

582
00:26:05,246 --> 00:26:05,866
Let's get writing.

583
00:26:16,306 --> 00:26:21,246
Alright, so I'm going to launch

584
00:26:22,476 --> 00:26:25,976
and I have my device

585
00:26:25,976 --> 00:26:27,456
and Xcode here right behind.

586
00:26:28,316 --> 00:26:30,406
So I'm going to give you a

587
00:26:30,406 --> 00:26:31,516
to get an idea of what it does.

588
00:26:32,416 --> 00:26:35,056
So here we have a

589
00:26:35,056 --> 00:26:37,156
This is an app that

590
00:26:37,756 --> 00:26:41,226
and uses core location to get

591
00:26:41,226 --> 00:26:45,116
as MapKit to fetch places

592
00:26:45,506 --> 00:26:47,726
So I'm going to look

593
00:26:48,246 --> 00:26:50,886
and I get a richer page

594
00:26:50,886 --> 00:26:54,096
like the name, phone

595
00:26:54,206 --> 00:26:55,866
as well as a map of this place.

596
00:26:56,456 --> 00:26:59,226
Now we're going to work

597
00:26:59,226 --> 00:27:01,286
and implement location

598
00:26:59,226 --> 00:27:01,286
and implement location

599
00:27:01,686 --> 00:27:04,066
so that this same

600
00:27:04,066 --> 00:27:04,986
in many different places.

601
00:27:05,036 --> 00:27:07,236
But before this, let's do that.

602
00:27:07,456 --> 00:27:08,436
I'm going to time myself.

603
00:27:08,436 --> 00:27:08,846
How about that?

604
00:27:09,636 --> 00:27:10,756
See how long it takes to do so.

605
00:27:11,756 --> 00:27:13,186
Now, I'll start the

606
00:27:13,796 --> 00:27:16,796
Alright, so I'm going

607
00:27:17,166 --> 00:27:20,156
And this is my location view

608
00:27:20,156 --> 00:27:23,286
that I use to display the

609
00:27:23,286 --> 00:27:25,526
the richer results

610
00:27:25,956 --> 00:27:26,746
And this is the method

611
00:27:26,746 --> 00:27:29,786
that I call every time a map

612
00:27:30,156 --> 00:27:34,096
So I'm going to go ahead and

613
00:27:35,086 --> 00:27:37,116
And this is where I'm

614
00:27:37,866 --> 00:27:41,226
So as you can see, I am creating

615
00:27:41,226 --> 00:27:44,736
with an activity type that is

616
00:27:44,736 --> 00:27:45,126
I'm doing.

617
00:27:45,666 --> 00:27:48,326
In this case, I'm also using

618
00:27:48,696 --> 00:27:50,846
which makes sure that my

619
00:27:51,476 --> 00:27:53,786
And I already defined

620
00:27:53,786 --> 00:27:54,896
in my info plist earlier.

621
00:27:55,716 --> 00:27:57,986
Next, we're setting the

622
00:27:58,396 --> 00:28:00,216
And again, here I'm

623
00:27:58,396 --> 00:28:00,216
And again, here I'm

624
00:28:00,446 --> 00:28:01,326
because that's what's going

625
00:28:01,326 --> 00:28:03,576
to be the public face

626
00:28:05,066 --> 00:28:08,246
Next, I'm setting Handoff, App

627
00:28:08,776 --> 00:28:11,176
because the content we're

628
00:28:11,796 --> 00:28:13,716
And the more important

629
00:28:14,226 --> 00:28:16,696
which is where I'm setting my

630
00:28:17,646 --> 00:28:20,636
Now again, this has

631
00:28:20,636 --> 00:28:23,036
of populating the

632
00:28:23,396 --> 00:28:24,746
So that's what I'm

633
00:28:24,946 --> 00:28:28,386
I'm just completing

634
00:28:28,386 --> 00:28:31,756
that this content supports

635
00:28:32,036 --> 00:28:34,356
This way it will have

636
00:28:34,486 --> 00:28:35,646
in the Spotlight Search results.

637
00:28:36,646 --> 00:28:38,556
Okay now, remember

638
00:28:39,136 --> 00:28:40,116
That's what I'm doing here.

639
00:28:40,476 --> 00:28:43,446
So, setting needsSave to

640
00:28:43,976 --> 00:28:48,276
This way, the userActivity

641
00:28:48,616 --> 00:28:50,826
when I need to update

642
00:28:52,066 --> 00:28:56,356
And finally, I'm using the

643
00:28:56,356 --> 00:28:58,286
by UR Responder in

644
00:28:58,696 --> 00:28:59,966
and setting the activity to it

645
00:29:00,146 --> 00:29:01,556
so that I keep a

646
00:29:01,786 --> 00:29:04,276
and that UIKit manages

647
00:29:05,536 --> 00:29:08,736
Next, I'm going to

648
00:29:09,026 --> 00:29:10,866
this User Activity

649
00:29:11,286 --> 00:29:12,476
updateUser ActivityState.

650
00:29:13,086 --> 00:29:16,296
And this is where I'm going to

651
00:29:16,786 --> 00:29:19,136
with the content that I

652
00:29:19,356 --> 00:29:22,366
which returns the

653
00:29:22,366 --> 00:29:23,396
the relevant information,

654
00:29:23,396 --> 00:29:25,226
that I need to recreate

655
00:29:26,056 --> 00:29:27,816
Okay, let's go ahead,

656
00:29:34,046 --> 00:29:37,406
Okay, so safe to say

657
00:29:37,406 --> 00:29:39,556
Okay, I didn't break

658
00:29:39,916 --> 00:29:42,856
So I'm going to go ahead

659
00:29:43,536 --> 00:29:47,936
and now as you can see,

660
00:29:47,936 --> 00:29:50,226
at the bottom to get

661
00:29:50,226 --> 00:29:51,286
that I was just looking at.

662
00:29:51,286 --> 00:29:51,946
It's very easy.

663
00:29:52,216 --> 00:29:52,766
Super handy.

664
00:29:54,066 --> 00:29:56,106
Same thing when I go to Maps.

665
00:29:56,106 --> 00:29:59,986
I see that same location

666
00:29:59,986 --> 00:30:01,676
even showing my application

667
00:29:59,986 --> 00:30:01,676
even showing my application

668
00:30:02,416 --> 00:30:04,636
[Applause] thank you.

[ Applause ]

670
00:30:09,246 --> 00:30:10,716
Alright, let's zoom back out.

671
00:30:11,286 --> 00:30:16,136
Same thing when I go to

672
00:30:16,136 --> 00:30:17,026
like "Let's meet at-- ."

673
00:30:17,326 --> 00:30:21,966
You see that I have the same

674
00:30:21,966 --> 00:30:26,246
suggested directly inside the

675
00:30:26,246 --> 00:30:29,426
so I can just tap on it and

676
00:30:29,426 --> 00:30:30,766
and the address get inserted.

677

[ Applause ]

678
00:30:36,126 --> 00:30:37,996
But, it even works

679
00:30:37,996 --> 00:30:40,516
So here I'm getting a text

680
00:30:40,516 --> 00:30:43,256
phone number is, and it's

681
00:30:43,256 --> 00:30:45,726
from my NSUserActivity so

682
00:30:45,836 --> 00:30:47,056
and insert the phone

683
00:30:47,866 --> 00:30:48,416
That's really cool.

684
00:30:49,516 --> 00:30:51,546
[ Applause ]

685
00:30:52,046 --> 00:30:53,256
Now let's go check on timing.

686
00:30:53,966 --> 00:30:54,706
Three minutes, forty.

687
00:30:55,136 --> 00:30:56,586
So that's not bad.

688
00:30:56,586 --> 00:30:58,456
All of these location

689
00:30:58,896 --> 00:31:00,916
provided by my app

690
00:30:58,896 --> 00:31:00,916
provided by my app

691
00:31:01,746 --> 00:31:02,686
Well, I cheated a little bit.

692
00:31:02,686 --> 00:31:05,446
I had some sample codes

693
00:31:05,646 --> 00:31:08,216
It's not a tremendous

694
00:31:08,376 --> 00:31:12,066
So messages, QuickType,

695
00:31:12,066 --> 00:31:13,706
all of that, a single API.

696
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:18,346
Alright, so we had worked

697
00:31:18,346 --> 00:31:19,376
indexing this content.

698
00:31:19,936 --> 00:31:21,446
So I'm going to go

699
00:31:21,446 --> 00:31:23,056
and restore it in

700
00:31:23,656 --> 00:31:25,296
Then I'm going to go ahead

701
00:31:26,056 --> 00:31:30,286
Pizza. And sure enough, I

702
00:31:30,286 --> 00:31:34,026
But when I go ahead and tap

703
00:31:34,176 --> 00:31:35,436
but my app doesn't

704
00:31:35,436 --> 00:31:37,506
It doesn't restore

705
00:31:37,506 --> 00:31:39,096
to the user as they

706
00:31:39,286 --> 00:31:41,996
It doesn't show the rich

707
00:31:41,996 --> 00:31:43,766
I'm going to go back

708
00:31:43,766 --> 00:31:46,016
and this is because I

709
00:31:46,016 --> 00:31:47,716
UIApplicationDelegate methods.

710
00:31:47,716 --> 00:31:51,536
So I'm going to go to my

711
00:31:51,536 --> 00:31:55,796
that part, and what

712
00:31:55,796 --> 00:31:58,916
I'm implementing the continue

713
00:31:59,166 --> 00:32:02,066
UIApplicationDelegate, checking

714
00:31:59,166 --> 00:32:02,066
UIApplicationDelegate, checking

715
00:32:02,236 --> 00:32:04,456
This is the one that we

716
00:32:04,866 --> 00:32:07,006
And then calling this method

717
00:32:07,346 --> 00:32:09,866
which looks at the userInfo

718
00:32:09,866 --> 00:32:11,336
as the user would expect.

719
00:32:12,106 --> 00:32:13,286
I'm going to build

720
00:32:13,846 --> 00:32:18,256
and see that one more time.

721
00:32:18,386 --> 00:32:23,006
So, I'll go back to

722
00:32:23,516 --> 00:32:25,706
and now we're doing the right

723
00:32:26,176 --> 00:32:27,186
as the user would expect.

724
00:32:28,126 --> 00:32:31,916
So that's a quick tour of how

725
00:32:32,196 --> 00:32:34,486
for location suggestions,

726
00:32:35,086 --> 00:32:36,756
Alright, let's switch back.

728
00:32:43,046 --> 00:32:44,646
So again, this sample

729
00:32:44,646 --> 00:32:45,886
on the Developer Library.

730
00:32:46,296 --> 00:32:48,446
It actually does a couple

731
00:32:48,706 --> 00:32:51,996
And it helps you test your

732
00:32:52,376 --> 00:32:55,136
So it's a great tool to keep by

733
00:32:55,426 --> 00:32:56,966
on the Location Suggestions

734
00:32:57,456 --> 00:33:02,716
Okay, so we just saw how easy

735
00:32:57,456 --> 00:33:02,716
Okay, so we just saw how easy

736
00:33:03,116 --> 00:33:06,486
and promote your content in many

737
00:33:06,486 --> 00:33:09,636
And we'll take a look at how

738
00:33:09,636 --> 00:33:12,476
of these benefits, specifically

739
00:33:13,006 --> 00:33:16,056
Now when we design these

740
00:33:16,056 --> 00:33:16,966
suggestion features.

741
00:33:17,486 --> 00:33:19,296
We wanted them to

742
00:33:19,716 --> 00:33:21,446
with websites you

743
00:33:22,726 --> 00:33:26,936
And so for this, for instance,

744
00:33:27,356 --> 00:33:29,686
which mirrors the same content

745
00:33:30,026 --> 00:33:32,916
in the Yelp app, when you

746
00:33:33,316 --> 00:33:35,376
you get the same,

747
00:33:35,376 --> 00:33:38,306
to get directions to this place.

748
00:33:38,306 --> 00:33:41,856
And that's because

749
00:33:42,086 --> 00:33:43,666
which is the technology

750
00:33:45,046 --> 00:33:45,856
A little bit of background,

751
00:33:47,086 --> 00:33:50,236
schema.org is open web markup

752
00:33:50,236 --> 00:33:52,126
to semantically annotate

753
00:33:52,566 --> 00:33:54,086
with rich, structured, metadata.

754
00:33:54,716 --> 00:33:56,596
So there are many

755
00:33:56,596 --> 00:33:58,676
of representations

756
00:33:59,146 --> 00:34:01,046
And schema.org is also intended

757
00:33:59,146 --> 00:34:01,046
And schema.org is also intended

758
00:34:01,046 --> 00:34:03,876
to provide a rich search

759
00:34:04,136 --> 00:34:07,786
both inside iOS, but also

760
00:34:08,426 --> 00:34:11,606
So these schemas

761
00:34:11,606 --> 00:34:12,556
in a tree-like structure.

762
00:34:13,065 --> 00:34:15,136
So for instance,

763
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:16,616
like restaurants inherits

764
00:34:16,616 --> 00:34:19,246
from more generic ones

765
00:34:20,196 --> 00:34:21,876
Let's take a look at

766
00:34:22,976 --> 00:34:25,806
So, it inherits from multiple

767
00:34:25,806 --> 00:34:27,436
inherits from all

768
00:34:27,436 --> 00:34:28,335
defining each of these.

769
00:34:28,846 --> 00:34:31,626
And for instance, the name

770
00:34:31,626 --> 00:34:35,346
in the Thing schema would

771
00:34:35,346 --> 00:34:36,525
of the restaurant in that case.

772
00:34:37,156 --> 00:34:38,886
Same with the address

773
00:34:38,886 --> 00:34:40,696
in the Local Business schema.

774
00:34:40,966 --> 00:34:43,136
And things that are more

775
00:34:43,386 --> 00:34:46,386
such as whether it accepts

776
00:34:46,386 --> 00:34:48,065
directly inside the

777
00:34:48,886 --> 00:34:51,516
So here's an example of

778
00:34:52,056 --> 00:34:54,275
On the left, we're seeing the

779
00:34:54,275 --> 00:34:54,755
at earlier.

780
00:34:55,255 --> 00:34:58,346
And on the right, content

781
00:34:58,796 --> 00:35:01,556
in a way that can be

782
00:34:58,796 --> 00:35:01,556
in a way that can be

783
00:35:02,486 --> 00:35:03,826
Creating things like

784
00:35:04,146 --> 00:35:05,836
the name of the restaurant,

785
00:35:05,836 --> 00:35:07,706
rating, website, and more.

786
00:35:07,706 --> 00:35:08,516
It can even do more.

787
00:35:09,646 --> 00:35:11,076
Let's look at a simple example.

788
00:35:11,626 --> 00:35:14,056
Here is a very simple

789
00:35:14,376 --> 00:35:15,966
describing content

790
00:35:17,036 --> 00:35:19,076
Now, let's look at how

791
00:35:19,516 --> 00:35:23,166
with the addition of

792
00:35:23,676 --> 00:35:26,646
As you can see, we

793
00:35:26,646 --> 00:35:27,656
to the actual content

794
00:35:27,886 --> 00:35:29,366
or the actual structure

795
00:35:29,786 --> 00:35:32,236
We've just provided

796
00:35:33,026 --> 00:35:36,056
describing the content in a

797
00:35:36,896 --> 00:35:40,366
It includes simple

798
00:35:40,916 --> 00:35:44,976
but also more complex structured

799
00:35:45,116 --> 00:35:47,676
which is itself another

800
00:35:48,476 --> 00:35:52,696
If you prefer, you can

801
00:35:52,816 --> 00:35:54,556
in line with microdata.

802
00:35:54,556 --> 00:35:56,166
So that's what we're doing here.

803
00:35:56,506 --> 00:35:58,046
We're changing the

804
00:35:58,046 --> 00:36:00,906
of our initial document

805
00:35:58,046 --> 00:36:00,906
of our initial document

806
00:36:01,366 --> 00:36:03,176
with inline microdata markups.

807
00:36:03,896 --> 00:36:07,656
So Safari in iOS 10, it strikes

808
00:36:08,056 --> 00:36:09,266
and promotes them much

809
00:36:09,266 --> 00:36:11,676
like a native app would

810
00:36:12,596 --> 00:36:15,016
That also gives you some of

811
00:36:15,016 --> 00:36:16,746
about earlier for

812
00:36:17,306 --> 00:36:20,536
So these are some of the

813
00:36:21,216 --> 00:36:23,696
Anything with a PostalAddress,

814
00:36:24,036 --> 00:36:26,926
or a telephone property, and the

815
00:36:26,926 --> 00:36:29,516
that we were working with

816
00:36:30,076 --> 00:36:33,486
You have all of these

817
00:36:34,056 --> 00:36:40,066
or specify the ones that you

818
00:36:40,066 --> 00:36:42,856
Alright, so we talked about

819
00:36:43,756 --> 00:36:46,876
Use NSUserActivity,

820
00:36:47,326 --> 00:36:50,216
that users view inside

821
00:36:50,216 --> 00:36:51,836
throughout the system,

822
00:36:53,536 --> 00:36:54,906
Also for communication apps.

823
00:36:55,656 --> 00:36:59,896
And also of course for all

824
00:37:00,406 --> 00:37:04,896
Use schema.org for your website,

825
00:37:05,266 --> 00:37:07,526
for location suggestion,

826
00:37:07,526 --> 00:37:08,426
through NSUserActivity.

827
00:37:09,776 --> 00:37:10,466
Alright, now let's move

828
00:37:10,466 --> 00:37:12,946
on to how your apps can

829
00:37:12,946 --> 00:37:14,796
suggestions like we

830
00:37:15,666 --> 00:37:16,946
So here we're going to talk

831
00:37:16,946 --> 00:37:18,326
about two different

832
00:37:18,866 --> 00:37:21,716
One through the keyboard, and

833
00:37:22,226 --> 00:37:24,326
Let's start with Number 1.

834
00:37:25,896 --> 00:37:29,566
So, if your app deals with

835
00:37:30,366 --> 00:37:33,766
you can benefit from location

836
00:37:34,126 --> 00:37:34,916
through the QuickType UI.

837
00:37:34,916 --> 00:37:38,796
Now here we're looking

838
00:37:39,406 --> 00:37:42,166
which is ride sharing app for

839
00:37:42,566 --> 00:37:46,086
And as the user enters a text

840
00:37:46,086 --> 00:37:50,056
as a location text field, we're

841
00:37:50,056 --> 00:37:52,076
from Yelp, directly inside Uber.

842
00:37:53,206 --> 00:37:56,296
Now this includes locations

843
00:37:56,496 --> 00:38:00,186
in NSUserActivities by

844
00:37:56,496 --> 00:38:00,186
in NSUserActivities by

845
00:38:00,706 --> 00:38:03,046
Upcoming locations

846
00:38:04,516 --> 00:38:07,096
Locations that you may have

847
00:38:07,096 --> 00:38:09,486
So if you receive text message

848
00:38:10,136 --> 00:38:13,836
And even, recent places

849
00:38:13,836 --> 00:38:15,056
with using Siri.

850
00:38:15,576 --> 00:38:18,026
So for instance, if

851
00:38:18,196 --> 00:38:20,296
if you ask Siri to show

852
00:38:20,296 --> 00:38:23,226
and then interact with a

853
00:38:23,226 --> 00:38:25,736
in there as part of

854
00:38:27,766 --> 00:38:30,366
So, we're introducing

855
00:38:30,366 --> 00:38:34,036
So your app can inform the

856
00:38:34,316 --> 00:38:35,356
text fields are expecting.

857
00:38:35,996 --> 00:38:39,666
And in this case, we were

858
00:38:40,226 --> 00:38:42,306
Now based on this hint,

859
00:38:42,306 --> 00:38:45,296
to make the right

860
00:38:45,566 --> 00:38:50,576
if there's any available

861
00:38:50,656 --> 00:38:53,396
But if there's no proactive

862
00:38:53,656 --> 00:38:55,776
it still provides a

863
00:38:55,776 --> 00:38:57,296
in terms of auto correction.

864
00:38:57,646 --> 00:38:59,426
Because autocorrect

865
00:38:59,686 --> 00:39:02,636
is now able to know what

866
00:38:59,686 --> 00:39:02,636
is now able to know what

867
00:39:04,576 --> 00:39:07,166
So, we added a new property

868
00:39:07,266 --> 00:39:09,756
in UITextInputTraits

869
00:39:10,446 --> 00:39:12,156
which allows you

870
00:39:12,156 --> 00:39:15,456
So here, we're working with

871
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:18,506
to UITextInputTraits, and

872
00:39:19,156 --> 00:39:22,806
And we're indicating that

873
00:39:22,806 --> 00:39:24,116
street address.

874
00:39:24,356 --> 00:39:27,236
There's a bunch of text content

875
00:39:27,806 --> 00:39:30,726
ranging from describing

876
00:39:30,916 --> 00:39:31,736
and a bunch of others.

877
00:39:32,476 --> 00:39:33,966
There's a full list

878
00:39:33,966 --> 00:39:34,976
in the Developer Library.

879
00:39:35,866 --> 00:39:39,506
But let's take a closer

880
00:39:39,506 --> 00:39:43,346
So these two are both

881
00:39:44,036 --> 00:39:45,746
but they have different

882
00:39:47,016 --> 00:39:48,996
So you want to use the one

883
00:39:48,996 --> 00:39:52,046
that represents your

884
00:39:52,706 --> 00:39:54,416
with the right level

885
00:39:54,826 --> 00:39:59,236
So for instance, a navigation

886
00:39:59,236 --> 00:40:02,286
full street address so that it

887
00:39:59,236 --> 00:40:02,286
full street address so that it

888
00:40:02,286 --> 00:40:05,956
to their destination, whereas a

889
00:40:05,956 --> 00:40:08,886
care about the state and city

890
00:40:09,426 --> 00:40:12,146
because that might just be

891
00:40:12,676 --> 00:40:15,276
And as you can see here, based

892
00:40:15,276 --> 00:40:18,486
that we specified, we're getting

893
00:40:18,486 --> 00:40:19,486
inside the QuickType bar.

894
00:40:19,706 --> 00:40:22,206
In one case, the full street

895
00:40:22,206 --> 00:40:23,486
just San Francisco, California.

896
00:40:24,076 --> 00:40:26,226
And that's how easy

897
00:40:26,226 --> 00:40:27,936
to get suggestions

898
00:40:28,986 --> 00:40:31,596
Now let's look at how your

899
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:35,196
from these nice direction

900
00:40:36,066 --> 00:40:38,826
Like Daniel said

901
00:40:39,086 --> 00:40:41,686
third party routing apps

902
00:40:42,186 --> 00:40:44,906
accelerating users

903
00:40:45,166 --> 00:40:47,966
when we think there is an intent

904
00:40:49,446 --> 00:40:52,756
So we're leveraging an existing

905
00:40:53,236 --> 00:40:54,706
which was introduced in iOS 6,

906
00:40:55,386 --> 00:40:57,396
and lets your routing

907
00:40:57,456 --> 00:41:00,716
and then handle all

908
00:40:57,456 --> 00:41:00,716
and then handle all

909
00:41:00,716 --> 00:41:04,876
iOS will learn over time what a

910
00:41:04,946 --> 00:41:07,866
based on various factors, such

911
00:41:08,366 --> 00:41:09,286
And then suggest it

912
00:41:09,596 --> 00:41:11,556
in the Multitasking

913
00:41:12,466 --> 00:41:18,626
So, to do so, you want to make

914
00:41:18,626 --> 00:41:19,966
to receive directions requests.

915
00:41:19,996 --> 00:41:21,696
And that's easily

916
00:41:22,226 --> 00:41:23,506
through the capabilities panel.

917
00:41:24,186 --> 00:41:27,736
In iOS 10, we're

918
00:41:27,736 --> 00:41:29,666
which is specifically

919
00:41:30,686 --> 00:41:32,566
Next, you want to

920
00:41:32,566 --> 00:41:34,166
where your app is

921
00:41:34,446 --> 00:41:37,116
So if your app is a local

922
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:40,946
you can specify that your app

923
00:41:40,946 --> 00:41:43,436
And finally, you

924
00:41:43,436 --> 00:41:46,396
that you take the appropriate

925
00:41:46,396 --> 00:41:47,736
within MKDirectionsRequest.

926
00:41:48,066 --> 00:41:50,746
And that is that your app should

927
00:41:51,026 --> 00:41:53,506
or populate the UI in a

928
00:41:53,756 --> 00:41:55,676
for the user to get directions.

929
00:41:56,486 --> 00:41:58,686
In terms of code,

930
00:41:58,686 --> 00:42:01,106
of how you can adopt

931
00:41:58,686 --> 00:42:01,106
of how you can adopt

932
00:42:01,996 --> 00:42:04,396
MKDirectionsRequest

933
00:42:04,836 --> 00:42:08,096
So when your app is launched,

934
00:42:08,446 --> 00:42:09,886
First thing we're

935
00:42:09,886 --> 00:42:11,866
that the URL we're

936
00:42:11,866 --> 00:42:13,266
valid MKDirectionsRequest.

937
00:42:13,916 --> 00:42:17,156
An MKDirectionsRequest offers

938
00:42:17,156 --> 00:42:18,416
to your URL for that.

939
00:42:19,646 --> 00:42:22,906
Next, we're extenuating an

940
00:42:23,096 --> 00:42:26,156
from the contents of that URL

941
00:42:26,156 --> 00:42:28,566
about the origin

942
00:42:28,776 --> 00:42:30,416
that the user is

943
00:42:31,716 --> 00:42:34,446
And next and new in iOS 10,

944
00:42:34,446 --> 00:42:35,976
especially for those of you

945
00:42:35,976 --> 00:42:38,106
who already adopt

946
00:42:38,746 --> 00:42:41,176
is that you can now be

947
00:42:41,176 --> 00:42:43,086
that don't have geo-coordinates.

948
00:42:43,766 --> 00:42:45,536
And in this case,

949
00:42:45,536 --> 00:42:49,196
that address dictionary you

950
00:42:49,506 --> 00:42:53,756
geocode AddressDictionary, which

951
00:42:53,806 --> 00:42:55,686
with the right latitude

952
00:42:56,046 --> 00:42:57,686
which will help you

953
00:42:57,686 --> 00:42:58,726
to the intended location.

954
00:42:59,286 --> 00:43:00,336
And that's pretty much it.

955
00:42:59,286 --> 00:43:00,336
And that's pretty much it.

956
00:43:01,186 --> 00:43:03,106
That's how your routing app

957
00:43:03,436 --> 00:43:05,726
in this prime real estate

958
00:43:07,236 --> 00:43:10,206
Now with that, I'd like to

959
00:43:10,206 --> 00:43:11,516
about media app suggestions.

960
00:43:11,906 --> 00:43:12,206
Thank you.

961
00:43:13,646 --> 00:43:14,676
&gt;&gt; That was awesome.

962
00:43:14,796 --> 00:43:20,986
Alright. Now, let's talk

963
00:43:21,686 --> 00:43:25,576
So, if you're an app that

964
00:43:25,576 --> 00:43:32,026
like a podcast app or a

965
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:36,876
that plays video, you'll

966
00:43:37,066 --> 00:43:41,316
iOS today, promotes the app

967
00:43:41,316 --> 00:43:42,986
to use based on your behavior.

968
00:43:43,186 --> 00:43:45,756
And we promote that app in

969
00:43:45,816 --> 00:43:46,906
that I showed you earlier.

970
00:43:48,376 --> 00:43:51,586
We in particular, offer those

971
00:43:51,956 --> 00:43:53,516
and in the Today View.

972
00:43:54,956 --> 00:44:00,976
If the act of the suggestion

973
00:43:54,956 --> 00:44:00,976
If the act of the suggestion

974
00:44:01,026 --> 00:44:04,706
like for example when you plug

975
00:44:05,016 --> 00:44:10,586
or even arriving at a certain

976
00:44:10,796 --> 00:44:12,246
we may further elevate that.

977
00:44:13,106 --> 00:44:14,616
So, let's see what

978
00:44:14,766 --> 00:44:17,116
This is what the promotion

979
00:44:17,536 --> 00:44:21,526
If say, I always or

980
00:44:21,566 --> 00:44:22,826
after plugging in headphones.

981
00:44:23,536 --> 00:44:25,606
Notice, in the upper

982
00:44:25,606 --> 00:44:28,536
the podcast app a suggestion.

983
00:44:28,536 --> 00:44:32,156
In certain situations

984
00:44:32,156 --> 00:44:34,806
of that will be elevated

985
00:44:35,076 --> 00:44:39,096
And so what you're seeing is,

986
00:44:39,096 --> 00:44:43,246
for Handoff, is now being

987
00:44:43,246 --> 00:44:46,056
that we think I'm likely to

988
00:44:46,056 --> 00:44:47,136
of those triggers I mentioned.

989
00:44:47,916 --> 00:44:52,456
Now, this is a pretty good

990
00:44:52,456 --> 00:44:55,616
as it could be because at the

991
00:44:55,616 --> 00:44:59,086
to do now is you have to

992
00:44:59,086 --> 00:45:02,026
in the right direction in

993
00:44:59,086 --> 00:45:02,026
in the right direction in

994
00:45:02,026 --> 00:45:04,456
that we're predicting, we

995
00:45:05,736 --> 00:45:07,176
With a pretty simple API,

996
00:45:07,926 --> 00:45:11,496
you can build a far better

997
00:45:12,076 --> 00:45:14,466
This is what it looks

998
00:45:14,466 --> 00:45:15,396
This is what I just showed you.

999
00:45:15,996 --> 00:45:20,466
And this is what it

1000
00:45:20,846 --> 00:45:21,446
We're getting it?

1001
00:45:21,576 --> 00:45:22,846
This is what it looks

1002
00:45:24,116 --> 00:45:25,346
This is what it looks

1003
00:45:25,766 --> 00:45:26,906
Far, far better.

1004
00:45:27,736 --> 00:45:32,456
Not only can the customer engage

1005
00:45:32,456 --> 00:45:36,316
to unlock their device, but you

1006
00:45:36,316 --> 00:45:37,776
and center, in front

1007
00:45:38,346 --> 00:45:41,536
Now, this might be quite

1008
00:45:41,536 --> 00:45:44,736
but this particular interface

1009
00:45:44,736 --> 00:45:48,116
conversion if you look

1010
00:45:48,316 --> 00:45:49,816
And so, if you're interested

1011
00:45:49,816 --> 00:45:52,346
in getting your users

1012
00:45:52,346 --> 00:45:55,506
which presumably you are,

1013
00:45:55,566 --> 00:45:56,816
So how do we do this?

1014
00:45:56,996 --> 00:45:58,356
I'm going to walk

1015
00:45:58,356 --> 00:45:59,876
The adoption is pretty simple.

1016
00:46:00,306 --> 00:46:05,896
It all boils down to a class

1017
00:46:06,386 --> 00:46:13,226
So let's imagine you've got

1018
00:46:13,226 --> 00:46:14,166
of different properties.

1019
00:46:14,416 --> 00:46:18,936
You know, a title, an artist,

1020
00:46:18,936 --> 00:46:21,766
to do is you want to get this

1021
00:46:21,766 --> 00:46:24,916
of the device when the system

1022
00:46:24,916 --> 00:46:25,946
to engage with it.

1023
00:46:26,816 --> 00:46:28,166
Well, you're going

1024
00:46:28,166 --> 00:46:31,926
by doing is importing Media

1025
00:46:32,126 --> 00:46:35,876
as conformant as to a

1026
00:46:36,036 --> 00:46:37,176
And then you're going to want

1027
00:46:37,176 --> 00:46:41,606
to implement a method called

1028
00:46:42,056 --> 00:46:43,956
It's pretty simple.

1029
00:46:44,276 --> 00:46:47,376
First, you want to

1030
00:46:47,626 --> 00:46:50,046
through whatever means you have.

1031
00:46:50,046 --> 00:46:51,766
Now, you'll obviously

1032
00:46:51,766 --> 00:46:53,816
especially if you're

1033
00:46:54,326 --> 00:46:55,366
for it not working.

1034
00:46:55,366 --> 00:46:56,646
In which case, you're

1035
00:46:56,646 --> 00:46:59,756
that call back handler

1036
00:46:59,756 --> 00:47:04,126
and the system will understand,

1037
00:46:59,756 --> 00:47:04,126
and the system will understand,

1038
00:47:05,406 --> 00:47:08,966
Next, you're going to want to

1039
00:47:08,966 --> 00:47:11,536
on the Lock Screen

1040
00:47:11,906 --> 00:47:14,416
This is a method that I

1041
00:47:14,476 --> 00:47:15,836
to show you what's behind it.

1042
00:47:16,606 --> 00:47:19,466
The first thing that you

1043
00:47:19,786 --> 00:47:22,216
onto the infoCenter object,

1044
00:47:23,296 --> 00:47:26,936
and then if you do

1045
00:47:26,936 --> 00:47:30,356
that this media item

1046
00:47:30,356 --> 00:47:32,536
that to the Lock

1047
00:47:32,536 --> 00:47:35,166
If you have a default image that

1048
00:47:35,166 --> 00:47:37,306
for you to get your

1049
00:47:37,306 --> 00:47:41,346
Then you're going to

1050
00:47:41,876 --> 00:47:43,876
to the nowPlayingInfo

1051
00:47:43,876 --> 00:47:47,946
and most importantly, you're

1052
00:47:47,946 --> 00:47:51,866
on the infoCenter,

1053
00:47:51,866 --> 00:47:53,526
that I showed you

1054
00:47:53,526 --> 00:47:57,846
So you want to do this

1055
00:47:58,526 --> 00:48:04,656
If for whatever reason you don't

1056
00:47:58,526 --> 00:48:04,656
If for whatever reason you don't

1057
00:48:04,656 --> 00:48:05,896
in preparing playback.

1058
00:48:05,896 --> 00:48:07,636
Again, if the phone's

1059
00:48:07,866 --> 00:48:10,566
This is another opportunity

1060
00:48:10,686 --> 00:48:12,766
Now note, you don't

1061
00:48:12,766 --> 00:48:14,376
to start playback at this point.

1062
00:48:15,046 --> 00:48:16,766
You plugged in your

1063
00:48:16,766 --> 00:48:19,296
for the customer to

1064
00:48:19,596 --> 00:48:21,226
But you want to get

1065
00:48:21,226 --> 00:48:22,626
load into Stream, and so forth.

1066
00:48:23,086 --> 00:48:25,506
And that's it.

1067
00:48:26,036 --> 00:48:31,156
So again, today, iOS promotes

1068
00:48:31,606 --> 00:48:35,336
If they follow a particular

1069
00:48:35,796 --> 00:48:37,426
we elevate them to

1070
00:48:38,266 --> 00:48:41,286
Through pretty simple adoption

1071
00:48:41,286 --> 00:48:45,026
you can get a much better

1072
00:48:45,026 --> 00:48:46,986
to promote your brand

1073
00:48:47,116 --> 00:48:51,376
and whatever gorgeous

1074
00:48:51,436 --> 00:48:55,966
Alright, so let's summarize

1075
00:48:56,516 --> 00:49:00,716
We spoke about a few simple APIs

1076
00:48:56,516 --> 00:49:00,716
We spoke about a few simple APIs

1077
00:49:00,756 --> 00:49:02,816
that helped you deeply

1078
00:49:02,946 --> 00:49:04,436
into the operating system.

1079
00:49:04,876 --> 00:49:08,156
We spoke about NSUserActivity,

1080
00:49:08,156 --> 00:49:09,396
of the operating system.

1081
00:49:09,746 --> 00:49:13,696
It helps us understand

1082
00:49:13,696 --> 00:49:15,526
is currently staring at.

1083
00:49:16,216 --> 00:49:20,406
Then we spoke about schema.org,

1084
00:49:20,566 --> 00:49:22,806
similar to NSUserActivities

1085
00:49:23,336 --> 00:49:29,996
We spoke about a new use

1086
00:49:29,996 --> 00:49:35,636
as a brand new UIKit API, to

1087
00:49:35,636 --> 00:49:37,956
when to elevate locations.

1088
00:49:39,876 --> 00:49:43,676
Then we spoke about MPContent,

1089
00:49:43,676 --> 00:49:48,466
Which is particularly

1090
00:49:48,726 --> 00:49:51,976
And hopefully it's been

1091
00:49:51,976 --> 00:49:55,606
that these APIs are easy

1092
00:49:57,536 --> 00:50:00,946
There's some more

1093
00:49:57,536 --> 00:50:00,946
There's some more

1094
00:50:01,986 --> 00:50:04,586
as well as some great

1095
00:50:05,026 --> 00:50:07,706
that you should check out,

1096
00:50:08,896 --> 00:50:11,256
There's a lot of related

1097
00:50:11,256 --> 00:50:15,296
A lot of related work around our

1098
00:50:15,336 --> 00:50:19,696
as well as some previous

1099
00:50:19,746 --> 00:50:23,486
around Handoff and

1100
00:50:24,206 --> 00:50:29,376
Lastly, I wanted to close by

1101
00:50:29,376 --> 00:50:32,976
that we are going to continue

1102
00:50:34,136 --> 00:50:39,716
And what we need from you,

1103
00:50:40,106 --> 00:50:42,186
about the capabilities

1104
00:50:43,066 --> 00:50:45,436
in the most detailed

1105
00:50:46,486 --> 00:50:49,346
Because fundamentally the

1106
00:50:49,666 --> 00:50:52,476
the more we'll understand

1107
00:50:53,436 --> 00:50:56,896
And so, you saw today, a

1108
00:50:56,896 --> 00:51:00,536
where there was varying levels

1109
00:50:56,896 --> 00:51:00,536
where there was varying levels

1110
00:51:00,786 --> 00:51:03,956
that you could annotate an

1111
00:51:04,576 --> 00:51:08,346
I'd encourage you as much

1112
00:51:08,346 --> 00:51:10,786
as explicit as you

1113
00:51:10,786 --> 00:51:13,416
not only to support the features

1114
00:51:13,686 --> 00:51:15,386
but also to put your application

1115
00:51:15,386 --> 00:51:16,946
in a good place,

1116
00:51:22,046 --> 00:51:23,136
Thank you all for coming today.

1117
00:51:23,136 --> 00:51:26,716
I hope you had a great

1118
00:51:27,426 --> 00:51:27,636
Bye, bye.

1119
00:51:28,516 --> 00:51:32,500
