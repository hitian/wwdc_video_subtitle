and I'm User Experience

00:00:39,896 --> 00:00:43,386
I work directly with developers

of their apps on Apple TV.

00:00:46,026 --> 00:00:49,436
And I'm here today to talk to

00:00:50,916 --> 00:00:52,786
This is a really exciting time

00:01:05,376 --> 00:01:07,736
to change the way

14
00:01:08,786 --> 00:01:12,106

16
00:01:16,636 --> 00:01:18,386
for your apps.

00:01:19,096 --> 00:01:21,576
So, today we will

18
00:01:21,576 --> 00:01:25,996
because this is a unique

19
00:01:25,996 --> 00:01:27,296
of design considerations.

20
00:01:28,536 --> 00:01:29,996
But, before we dive

21
00:01:30,726 --> 00:01:34,816
we need to first take a

22
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:37,806
This is TV.

23
00:01:39,536 --> 00:01:41,646
And we love TV.

24
00:01:42,256 --> 00:01:46,086
We love TV because it's

25
00:01:46,826 --> 00:01:51,766
It's a way to learn, to

26
00:01:51,766 --> 00:01:52,956
TV's are powerful.

27
00:01:53,556 --> 00:01:56,436
And the TV is something that

28
00:01:56,436 --> 00:01:59,746
at the same time, which

29
00:01:59,746 --> 00:02:04,356
at Apple TV unique from the rest

30
00:01:59,746 --> 00:02:04,356
at Apple TV unique from the rest

31
00:02:04,356 --> 00:02:05,926
of our devices are close.

Their personal because

33
00:02:08,866 --> 00:02:10,526
and we interact with

34
00:02:11,626 --> 00:02:15,086
But, the TV is not in

35
00:02:15,276 --> 00:02:17,906
And that screen is

36
00:02:19,116 --> 00:02:21,816
So, if you want to make

37
00:02:22,116 --> 00:02:24,386
you must first acknowledge

38
00:02:24,456 --> 00:02:26,406
between you and the screen.

39
00:02:26,956 --> 00:02:30,426
And you have to understand

40
00:02:30,426 --> 00:02:32,836
with that screen that's far

41
00:02:33,406 --> 00:02:34,836
because of that distance.

42
00:02:36,016 --> 00:02:37,886
So, this makes the

43
00:02:37,996 --> 00:02:39,456
from the rest of our devices.

44
00:02:39,456 --> 00:02:43,196
So, you have to design

00:02:43,866 --> 00:02:48,976
So, today talking about

46
00:02:49,506 --> 00:02:51,166
we will first go

47
00:02:51,376 --> 00:02:53,336
And that way we will

48
00:02:54,056 --> 00:02:56,236
And then we'll jump into

49
00:02:56,236 --> 00:02:56,996
of the TV.

50
00:02:57,316 --> 00:02:59,746
And how to design

51
00:03:00,206 --> 00:03:02,636
And how to design your app

52
00:03:03,886 --> 00:03:07,006
We're going to touch on some

53
00:03:07,496 --> 00:03:09,556
and those will be the ones

54
00:03:10,206 --> 00:03:12,496
And I also want to

55
00:03:12,786 --> 00:03:15,406
that have designed

56
00:03:16,006 --> 00:03:19,176
So, let's go ahead and

57
00:03:19,896 --> 00:03:25,906
If you're coming over from

58
00:03:25,906 --> 00:03:28,156
app layouts don't

59
00:03:28,296 --> 00:03:29,526
to the size of the screen.

60
00:03:30,336 --> 00:03:33,136
Your interface is going to

61
00:03:33,136 --> 00:03:34,756
of the TV screen size.

62
00:03:35,976 --> 00:03:39,436
So, you need to design with

63
00:03:39,436 --> 00:03:45,056
by 1080 pixels, which implies a

64
00:03:45,676 --> 00:03:49,546
And all of your assets

65
00:03:50,566 --> 00:03:52,446
And there's something

66
00:03:53,406 --> 00:03:55,096
over scanning can

67
00:03:55,096 --> 00:03:57,786
And this could cause

68
00:03:58,276 --> 00:04:00,856
So, keep your apps

69
00:03:58,276 --> 00:04:00,856
So, keep your apps

70
00:04:00,856 --> 00:04:02,076
from the edges of the screen.

71
00:04:02,486 --> 00:04:06,596
And a good guide is to avoid 60

72
00:04:06,956 --> 00:04:08,696
and 90 pixels from each side.

73
00:04:09,366 --> 00:04:12,316
So, that's it.

74
00:04:12,446 --> 00:04:13,346
Those are the basics.

75
00:04:14,126 --> 00:04:17,196
So, now we can talk about

76
00:04:17,696 --> 00:04:20,875
that makes the TV unique and

77
00:04:21,716 --> 00:04:24,026
And that is our distance

78
00:04:25,956 --> 00:04:30,356
So, on average we are 10

79
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:34,496
And that's significant,

80
00:04:34,496 --> 00:04:36,746
of that distance when you're

81
00:04:38,356 --> 00:04:41,236
So, keep in mind that

82
00:04:41,236 --> 00:04:42,336
to see from far away.

83
00:04:43,456 --> 00:04:46,216
Everything in your user

84
00:04:46,706 --> 00:04:48,946
And that's starting

85
00:04:49,896 --> 00:04:52,626
Both graphics and your user

86
00:04:52,726 --> 00:04:55,286
buttons or controls

87
00:04:55,286 --> 00:04:57,426
so they can be easily

88
00:04:59,686 --> 00:05:01,426
Now, I know it may

89
00:04:59,686 --> 00:05:01,426
Now, I know it may

90
00:05:01,646 --> 00:05:03,406
if you're used to

91
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:07,606
But, on Apple TV you want

92
00:05:07,646 --> 00:05:09,516
to struggle to see

93
00:05:10,336 --> 00:05:13,796
So, larger items are simply

94
00:05:15,516 --> 00:05:19,166
In addition to increasing your

95
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:20,866
to include plenty of spacing

96
00:05:20,866 --> 00:05:22,456
between those elements

97
00:05:23,116 --> 00:05:25,756
This will help people

98
00:05:26,096 --> 00:05:28,646
And it makes them easier

99
00:05:30,396 --> 00:05:34,336
Now, grid layouts tend to work

100
00:05:34,756 --> 00:05:37,716
And if you use a grid

101
00:05:37,716 --> 00:05:41,926
of your content doesn't fit onto

102
00:05:41,926 --> 00:05:43,206
to those off-screen items.

103
00:05:43,756 --> 00:05:45,876
This will let people know

104
00:05:46,696 --> 00:05:50,036
And only those partially

105
00:05:50,356 --> 00:05:51,066
in this zone.

106
00:05:51,646 --> 00:05:56,566
So, for Apple TV, if you want

107
00:05:56,876 --> 00:05:58,186
there's some templates

108
00:05:58,186 --> 00:05:59,986
and they're all highly

109
00:06:00,556 --> 00:06:03,676
You have control over

110
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:05,776
background, tinting, and more.

111
00:06:07,036 --> 00:06:10,136
You can find these on the

112
00:06:10,466 --> 00:06:12,856
And I'll include a link to them

113
00:06:14,376 --> 00:06:17,096
So, now let's talk about text.

114
00:06:18,046 --> 00:06:22,226
Let's just imagine we're

115
00:06:22,586 --> 00:06:24,936
and we're sitting away

116
00:06:25,646 --> 00:06:26,586
All right.

117
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,706
So, let's just toss some

118
00:06:29,796 --> 00:06:32,366
And can anybody see this?

119
00:06:32,496 --> 00:06:35,166
Well? Somewhat.

120
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:37,606
Okay. People in the

121
00:06:37,606 --> 00:06:39,776
But, people in the back, it

122
00:06:40,216 --> 00:06:41,596
So, what's my point?

123
00:06:42,696 --> 00:06:45,486
Make your text much

124
00:06:46,136 --> 00:06:48,856
This will insure your

125
00:06:48,856 --> 00:06:50,886
and descriptions

126
00:06:51,966 --> 00:06:54,216
But, increasing the point

127
00:06:54,216 --> 00:06:56,216
that you can do for

128
00:06:57,236 --> 00:07:00,706
You can also use a heavier font

129
00:06:57,236 --> 00:07:00,706
You can also use a heavier font

130
00:07:01,896 --> 00:07:05,716
This weight is significantly

131
00:07:07,126 --> 00:07:11,406
So, when you're evaluating a

132
00:07:11,406 --> 00:07:14,956
font's with weights like

133
00:07:14,956 --> 00:07:17,076
and bold are all great options.

134
00:07:17,926 --> 00:07:21,366
And you typically want to avoid

135
00:07:22,406 --> 00:07:24,766
So, if you have a brand

136
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:27,806
I highly recommend

137
00:07:28,426 --> 00:07:30,856
And then see where you can

138
00:07:31,386 --> 00:07:34,086
Even if it's just up to

139
00:07:34,086 --> 00:07:36,106
so much easier to see on the TV.

140
00:07:37,656 --> 00:07:40,666
And I know that beautiful,

141
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:41,806
of your brand identity.

142
00:07:42,376 --> 00:07:45,536
But, if people can't read

143
00:07:45,536 --> 00:07:47,246
it's going to be a

144
00:07:47,246 --> 00:07:49,486
And that's going to reflect

145
00:07:49,766 --> 00:07:54,186
So, in the system, we

146
00:07:54,186 --> 00:07:55,506
and it's called San Francisco.

147
00:07:56,396 --> 00:07:57,926
There are two variants

148
00:07:58,256 --> 00:08:01,826
Both of which were designed for

149
00:07:58,256 --> 00:08:01,826
Both of which were designed for

150
00:08:02,626 --> 00:08:05,726
There's San Francisco text

151
00:08:06,676 --> 00:08:08,576
So, let's take a look

152
00:08:09,896 --> 00:08:12,596
This is San Francisco

153
00:08:13,366 --> 00:08:15,996
And when you use San

154
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:19,236
tvOS automatically applies the

155
00:08:19,306 --> 00:08:20,386
based on point size.

156
00:08:20,906 --> 00:08:23,306
And it's going to respect

157
00:08:23,756 --> 00:08:25,466
such as bold type.

158
00:08:26,036 --> 00:08:29,026
San Francisco will work

159
00:08:29,766 --> 00:08:31,596
But, if you need to

160
00:08:32,056 --> 00:08:35,285
make sure that it respects

161
00:08:35,696 --> 00:08:37,556
and it's legible

162
00:08:38,785 --> 00:08:44,145
So, for example, in Badland they

163
00:08:44,336 --> 00:08:45,856
within the style of the game.

164
00:08:46,876 --> 00:08:48,556
It reads clearly across the room

165
00:08:48,556 --> 00:08:49,946
because of its heavier

166
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:53,086
So, unless your app

167
00:08:53,086 --> 00:08:55,876
for a custom font, stick

168
00:08:56,266 --> 00:08:59,916
because above all text on

169
00:09:00,556 --> 00:09:05,236
So, I've only touched

170
00:09:05,236 --> 00:09:06,846
to consider with text on screen.

171
00:09:07,746 --> 00:09:11,066
If you want to learn more about

172
00:09:11,066 --> 00:09:13,736
out the Typography and Font

173
00:09:13,736 --> 00:09:16,036
on this stage with

174
00:09:17,396 --> 00:09:21,326
So, we've already

175
00:09:21,546 --> 00:09:23,866
spacing, templates, and text.

176
00:09:24,716 --> 00:09:26,226
All to accommodate

177
00:09:26,226 --> 00:09:28,496
between us and the TV screen.

178
00:09:29,606 --> 00:09:31,676
But, there's still one

179
00:09:32,226 --> 00:09:34,086
And that is your apps hierarchy.

180
00:09:35,296 --> 00:09:37,986
Keep your app approachable

181
00:09:39,086 --> 00:09:41,326
Do you remember how you

182
00:09:41,326 --> 00:09:43,496
and just instantly be

183
00:09:44,376 --> 00:09:48,016
Well, that ease and instant

184
00:09:48,016 --> 00:09:49,886
to your apps on the

185
00:09:51,366 --> 00:09:54,476
So, in designing your apps

186
00:09:55,216 --> 00:09:58,316
Let people jump immediately

187
00:09:59,046 --> 00:10:01,726
Too many choices or options

188
00:09:59,046 --> 00:10:01,726
Too many choices or options

189
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:05,486
which will add a psychological

190
00:10:05,486 --> 00:10:07,506
to the physical distance

191
00:10:08,826 --> 00:10:10,236
So, if you have a

192
00:10:10,566 --> 00:10:13,946
a great way to simplify your

193
00:10:14,976 --> 00:10:17,356
This will instantly

194
00:10:17,356 --> 00:10:20,426
and it'll organize all of your

195
00:10:20,766 --> 00:10:22,786
that are quick and

196
00:10:24,046 --> 00:10:27,106
Each tab bar should provide

197
00:10:27,106 --> 00:10:29,706
from the top level of your app.

198
00:10:29,706 --> 00:10:32,276
And if you use a tab

199
00:10:32,276 --> 00:10:33,096
on the screen at once.

200
00:10:33,896 --> 00:10:36,496
And don't just use it as

201
00:10:37,806 --> 00:10:40,036
If you need to declutter

202
00:10:40,036 --> 00:10:43,196
I recommend placing your app

203
00:10:43,986 --> 00:10:46,876
People tend to only go

204
00:10:46,876 --> 00:10:49,556
that you don't need to waste

205
00:10:49,886 --> 00:10:52,086
or in the main level

206
00:10:53,516 --> 00:10:57,066
So, to recap, when

207
00:10:57,526 --> 00:11:00,046
remember on average

208
00:10:57,526 --> 00:11:00,046
remember on average

209
00:11:00,046 --> 00:11:01,486
between you and the screen.

210
00:11:02,386 --> 00:11:04,236
And to accommodate

211
00:11:04,566 --> 00:11:07,346
you want to use larger

212
00:11:08,386 --> 00:11:11,326
You want to provide adequate

213
00:11:11,326 --> 00:11:15,066
so they're easier to see,

214
00:11:15,896 --> 00:11:19,316
With text, legibility

215
00:11:19,946 --> 00:11:22,766
Use large point sizes

216
00:11:23,306 --> 00:11:26,556
So, don't be afraid to go big

217
00:11:27,096 --> 00:11:31,076
And remember to keep

218
00:11:31,196 --> 00:11:32,726
with a very simple hierarchy.

219
00:11:33,496 --> 00:11:36,926
Don't add to the distance with

220
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:39,746
And there's actually

221
00:11:39,886 --> 00:11:42,366
to check your designs

222
00:11:43,156 --> 00:11:46,716
And that is to toss your wire

223
00:11:47,246 --> 00:11:49,946
and review your layout,

224
00:11:50,016 --> 00:11:52,846
and text on an actual

225
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:54,826
And you can ask yourself,

226
00:11:55,196 --> 00:11:57,766
can you see everything

227
00:11:57,766 --> 00:12:01,576
And is it easy to jump

228
00:11:57,766 --> 00:12:01,576
And is it easy to jump

229
00:12:03,036 --> 00:12:05,646
I know this may seem like

230
00:12:05,806 --> 00:12:08,756
but I've been in many UI

231
00:12:08,756 --> 00:12:10,006
of issues could have been caught

232
00:12:10,836 --> 00:12:12,376
if the app had simply

233
00:12:12,376 --> 00:12:15,906
on an actual TV across the room.

234
00:12:16,106 --> 00:12:19,956
I've seen some really great

235
00:12:19,956 --> 00:12:21,996
tripped up on designing

236
00:12:22,106 --> 00:12:24,506
because they have not

237
00:12:25,056 --> 00:12:29,276
If you don't have a TV to

238
00:12:29,356 --> 00:12:33,366
And don't just, yeah, and

239
00:12:33,366 --> 00:12:34,326
to you at your desk.

240
00:12:35,096 --> 00:12:38,696
You need to place it across

241
00:12:38,696 --> 00:12:42,296
of that, people will be able to

242
00:12:42,696 --> 00:12:45,156
And they will love being

243
00:12:45,156 --> 00:12:46,436
into your apps experience.

244
00:12:46,976 --> 00:12:50,736
So, that's designing

245
00:12:51,536 --> 00:12:55,636
And because of that distance,

246
00:12:55,636 --> 00:12:59,426
with the remote, which is the

247
00:12:59,426 --> 00:13:02,226
to consider when

248
00:12:59,426 --> 00:13:02,226
to consider when

249
00:13:03,776 --> 00:13:07,876
So, as I mentioned, the rest

250
00:13:08,016 --> 00:13:09,976
and where you interact

251
00:13:11,046 --> 00:13:13,316
However, on the Apple

252
00:13:13,316 --> 00:13:15,096
and where you interact

253
00:13:16,556 --> 00:13:18,776
The Siri Remote allows

254
00:13:18,986 --> 00:13:21,176
with the TV screen

255
00:13:22,596 --> 00:13:25,416
And people want to be

256
00:13:25,886 --> 00:13:29,056
They expect interacting

257
00:13:29,756 --> 00:13:33,136
So, if they have to look down

258
00:13:33,136 --> 00:13:37,566
to go back, the connection with

259
00:13:38,856 --> 00:13:40,236
So, to avoid breaking

260
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:42,826
that connection you

261
00:13:42,826 --> 00:13:44,766
to work seamlessly

262
00:13:45,506 --> 00:13:48,836
And to do that, you need to

263
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:52,706
First, there's a touch surface

264
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:55,076
on the Siri Remote

265
00:13:55,636 --> 00:13:58,466
And that's going to move focus

266
00:13:58,966 --> 00:14:01,176
And that's typically used

267
00:13:58,966 --> 00:14:01,176
And that's typically used

268
00:14:02,506 --> 00:14:04,736
You can also click

269
00:14:04,736 --> 00:14:07,096
and that activates a

270
00:14:07,816 --> 00:14:09,716
You can also click

271
00:14:09,716 --> 00:14:11,036
to enter into an edit state.

272
00:14:11,376 --> 00:14:14,506
And this could also be great

273
00:14:14,986 --> 00:14:16,866
and drag an item

274
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:21,236
And finally you can

275
00:14:21,236 --> 00:14:23,116
through a collection one by one.

276
00:14:23,116 --> 00:14:26,156
But, it's also a really

277
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:30,306
So, it could be great in a game

278
00:14:30,906 --> 00:14:34,936
as long as that action is

279
00:14:35,116 --> 00:14:36,456
So, moving on to the buttons.

280
00:14:36,456 --> 00:14:37,876
You have the menu button.

281
00:14:38,346 --> 00:14:40,536
And pressing this should return

282
00:14:41,866 --> 00:14:44,226
There's Play/Pause,

283
00:14:44,226 --> 00:14:45,406
that during media playback.

284
00:14:45,896 --> 00:14:48,306
And it's also a great

285
00:14:49,036 --> 00:14:52,786
And also remember that you

286
00:14:52,786 --> 00:14:56,386
accelerometer, gyroscope,

287
00:14:58,106 --> 00:15:01,226
Siri, home, and the volume

288
00:14:58,106 --> 00:15:01,226
Siri, home, and the volume

289
00:15:01,226 --> 00:15:01,876
for the system.

290
00:15:02,446 --> 00:15:06,866
But, I want to go back

291
00:15:06,866 --> 00:15:12,606
of special attention, and give

292
00:15:12,856 --> 00:15:14,566
So, here's your app hierarchy.

293
00:15:15,686 --> 00:15:17,906
If you click, that's

294
00:15:18,016 --> 00:15:19,996
into each level of your app.

295
00:15:19,996 --> 00:15:23,146
And pressing menu will return

296
00:15:24,026 --> 00:15:28,346
This is the correct and expected

297
00:15:29,376 --> 00:15:32,556
However, only in

298
00:15:32,836 --> 00:15:34,166
there's a slight variation,

299
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:36,006
and I'll like to

300
00:15:37,016 --> 00:15:39,946
So, for example in the

301
00:15:40,566 --> 00:15:43,106
if I press menu while

302
00:15:43,426 --> 00:15:45,126
I'm presented with a pause menu.

303
00:15:45,676 --> 00:15:49,586
And because we're used to

304
00:15:49,926 --> 00:15:51,546
to bring us out of

305
00:15:52,036 --> 00:15:54,236
pressing menu here

306
00:15:54,856 --> 00:15:57,776
So, it's important to

307
00:15:57,776 --> 00:15:58,886
to exit out of the game.

308
00:15:59,686 --> 00:16:01,606
So, in this case

309
00:15:59,686 --> 00:16:01,606
So, in this case

310
00:16:01,786 --> 00:16:04,596
And if I navigate to

311
00:16:04,596 --> 00:16:06,186
to the level selection screen.

312
00:16:06,876 --> 00:16:09,606
And this is where menu

313
00:16:10,036 --> 00:16:13,536
If you press menu, it brings you

314
00:16:13,646 --> 00:16:15,816
And with one more

315
00:16:15,816 --> 00:16:17,066
on the Apple TV home screen.

316
00:16:17,616 --> 00:16:21,366
So, that's how the

317
00:16:21,616 --> 00:16:25,006
And it should behave exactly

318
00:16:25,586 --> 00:16:30,766
So, as you may have heard in a

319
00:16:31,066 --> 00:16:34,476
new remote app that works

320
00:16:34,886 --> 00:16:37,486
It has a great game

321
00:16:38,636 --> 00:16:40,296
And speaking of game

322
00:16:41,836 --> 00:16:44,486
if your game has an

323
00:16:44,816 --> 00:16:46,756
that can't be supported

324
00:16:47,176 --> 00:16:49,736
you can now require the

325
00:16:50,896 --> 00:16:53,006
And if your game

326
00:16:53,306 --> 00:16:55,306
or if you support game

327
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:59,496
to the Siri Remote, make sure

328
00:16:59,496 --> 00:17:03,396
to navigate through the Apple TV

329
00:16:59,496 --> 00:17:03,396
to navigate through the Apple TV

330
00:17:04,736 --> 00:17:07,006
And you should always

331
00:17:07,006 --> 00:17:10,445
if a controller is required,

332
00:17:11,566 --> 00:17:16,205
because your app can be

333
00:17:16,346 --> 00:17:19,036
And even though your game may

334
00:17:19,036 --> 00:17:21,636
remember that the

335
00:17:21,636 --> 00:17:23,226
with every single Apple TV.

336
00:17:23,646 --> 00:17:25,846
And a controller is

337
00:17:26,915 --> 00:17:30,016
So, if you go controller

338
00:17:30,016 --> 00:17:31,616
out on new players who want

339
00:17:31,616 --> 00:17:34,796
to try your game first before

340
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:40,406
So, remember, with Apple TV,

341
00:17:40,596 --> 00:17:42,886
and they don't want to look

342
00:17:42,886 --> 00:17:44,346
to navigate, or interact.

343
00:17:45,396 --> 00:17:48,616
So, use intuitive gestures

344
00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:52,016
And if your app works

345
00:17:52,546 --> 00:17:54,786
new remote app, and

346
00:17:55,326 --> 00:17:57,746
people will stay connect

347
00:17:59,256 --> 00:18:02,516
So, what do all of these

348
00:17:59,256 --> 00:18:02,516
So, what do all of these

349
00:18:03,836 --> 00:18:05,286
They control focus.

350
00:18:06,366 --> 00:18:10,076
And focus needs to be obvious so

351
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:14,936
So, on Apple TV,

352
00:18:14,936 --> 00:18:18,336
when an object is elevated,

353
00:18:18,386 --> 00:18:21,406
to subtle movements on the touch

354
00:18:22,576 --> 00:18:24,906
Did you all notice how your

355
00:18:24,906 --> 00:18:25,676
to that movement?

356
00:18:26,686 --> 00:18:28,166
Well, that's exactly

357
00:18:28,316 --> 00:18:30,926
And that's why the system

358
00:18:32,796 --> 00:18:37,856
People expect to be able to

359
00:18:37,856 --> 00:18:39,526
to navigate around onscreen.

360
00:18:39,526 --> 00:18:41,396
And they should always

361
00:18:41,756 --> 00:18:42,766
and what's actionable.

362
00:18:44,636 --> 00:18:46,316
So, now watch closely.

363
00:18:46,816 --> 00:18:49,496
This will be a very slow

364
00:18:49,496 --> 00:18:52,416
to illustrate something unique

365
00:18:53,756 --> 00:18:56,796
Notice how it gently indicates

366
00:18:56,856 --> 00:18:59,216
which direction you're

367
00:18:59,216 --> 00:19:02,046
And this helps aid

368
00:18:59,216 --> 00:19:02,046
And this helps aid

369
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:06,386
This focus model is used

370
00:19:06,386 --> 00:19:08,286
And this consistent look

371
00:19:08,286 --> 00:19:10,936
and feel helps maintain

372
00:19:11,226 --> 00:19:12,276
with what's on screen.

373
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:16,156
So, use the system focus model.

374
00:19:17,346 --> 00:19:20,406
Only in a few special

375
00:19:20,736 --> 00:19:23,206
you may want to customize

376
00:19:24,376 --> 00:19:30,006
So, for example, back in Badland

377
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:33,456
And this fits well within the

378
00:19:33,536 --> 00:19:35,156
because focus is obvious.

379
00:19:36,206 --> 00:19:39,786
So, if you want to learn more

380
00:19:40,586 --> 00:19:42,206
check out the Focus

381
00:19:42,206 --> 00:19:45,596
on tvOS session tomorrow

382
00:19:48,556 --> 00:19:53,106
So, with your app icon on

383
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:56,976
with focus and parallax in mind.

384
00:19:57,066 --> 00:20:00,306
You can create some pretty cool

385
00:19:57,066 --> 00:20:00,306
You can create some pretty cool

386
00:20:00,306 --> 00:20:02,666
transparency, scaling,

387
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:06,156
And there's a great parallax

388
00:20:06,156 --> 00:20:10,936
in include in the

389
00:20:11,146 --> 00:20:15,336
So, when you're designing

390
00:20:15,516 --> 00:20:17,456
you should use intuitive

391
00:20:17,556 --> 00:20:20,306
and expected button behaviors

392
00:20:20,306 --> 00:20:21,366
to the previous screen.

393
00:20:22,066 --> 00:20:24,326
And implement your

394
00:20:24,326 --> 00:20:27,866
with the Siri Remote's new

395
00:20:28,596 --> 00:20:31,416
You should use the

396
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:33,386
for clarity and consistency.

397
00:20:34,196 --> 00:20:36,576
That way people will feel like

398
00:20:36,576 --> 00:20:39,436
with the screen even though

399
00:20:40,126 --> 00:20:44,076
And if you make a

400
00:20:44,476 --> 00:20:46,576
be sure to make focus obvious.

401
00:20:47,326 --> 00:20:50,006
And focus should always move

402
00:20:50,006 --> 00:20:51,496
to help aid in navigation.

403
00:20:52,056 --> 00:20:56,966
And finally with the

404
00:20:56,966 --> 00:20:59,926
that you don't break people's

405
00:21:00,496 --> 00:21:06,816
So, that's designing

406
00:21:06,966 --> 00:21:07,326
All right.

407
00:21:07,326 --> 00:21:10,406
Awesome. We've made

408
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:14,586
And there are a lot of great

409
00:21:15,266 --> 00:21:18,336
For those of you who were in

410
00:21:18,336 --> 00:21:21,276
about these directly from

411
00:21:21,816 --> 00:21:24,986
And don't worry, if you missed

412
00:21:24,986 --> 00:21:26,506
first, thank you so much.

413
00:21:27,636 --> 00:21:29,736
And secondly, you

414
00:21:29,736 --> 00:21:31,956
that session on your WWDC app.

415
00:21:32,746 --> 00:21:34,676
So, I'm just going

416
00:21:34,716 --> 00:21:36,566
on the new appearance feature,

417
00:21:36,616 --> 00:21:39,946
because that is what

418
00:21:41,896 --> 00:21:46,846
There is now light and dark

419
00:21:46,846 --> 00:21:49,896
And this is user

420
00:21:49,896 --> 00:21:52,556
And it changes the look

421
00:21:53,366 --> 00:21:55,766
Pretty much every single

422
00:21:55,766 --> 00:21:57,906
to some degree for

423
00:21:58,456 --> 00:22:00,266
This include place

424
00:21:58,456 --> 00:22:00,266
This include place

425
00:22:00,266 --> 00:22:01,876
they're dark instead of light.

426
00:22:02,266 --> 00:22:03,696
Shadows have different values.

427
00:22:04,176 --> 00:22:06,486
And this is a great

428
00:22:07,916 --> 00:22:12,276
So, to support dark appearance,

429
00:22:12,886 --> 00:22:15,146
And I encourage you to do

430
00:22:15,146 --> 00:22:17,976
in this talk today

431
00:22:18,746 --> 00:22:23,296
So, opt in and your app will

432
00:22:23,296 --> 00:22:25,466
on how they wish to

433
00:22:25,826 --> 00:22:27,086
in their own environment.

434
00:22:28,696 --> 00:22:32,576
Now, user preferences also

435
00:22:33,456 --> 00:22:37,486
And Apple TV is packed full

436
00:22:37,486 --> 00:22:40,266
that provide the best user

437
00:22:41,606 --> 00:22:45,276
Apps implementing custom fonts

438
00:22:45,276 --> 00:22:49,176
behavior of system fonts and

439
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:53,056
Accessibility options

440
00:22:53,346 --> 00:22:55,166
reduce motion, and more.

441
00:22:55,796 --> 00:22:57,566
So, if you have a

442
00:22:58,766 --> 00:23:01,336
that could be made accessible

443
00:22:58,766 --> 00:23:01,336
that could be made accessible

444
00:23:01,806 --> 00:23:04,576
So, I encourage you to check out

445
00:23:07,696 --> 00:23:11,646
So, appearance and accessibility

446
00:23:11,646 --> 00:23:12,746
on tvOS 10.

447
00:23:13,236 --> 00:23:16,016
And I'm looking forward to

448
00:23:17,586 --> 00:23:18,466
So, that's features.

449
00:23:20,796 --> 00:23:23,886
Now, I would love to

450
00:23:24,186 --> 00:23:27,376
that have not only designed

451
00:23:28,266 --> 00:23:31,896
but they're also changing

452
00:23:34,196 --> 00:23:36,826
So, first this app is Zova.

453
00:23:37,526 --> 00:23:40,446
And it's a lifestyle fitness

454
00:23:40,446 --> 00:23:42,156
into a yoga studio or place

455
00:23:42,156 --> 00:23:43,406
where you could workout

456
00:23:44,546 --> 00:23:47,156
Not only is this significantly

457
00:23:47,156 --> 00:23:50,776
in some workout DVD's, but

458
00:23:50,776 --> 00:23:53,036
on Apple TV, because

459
00:23:53,036 --> 00:23:56,076
to find a workout

460
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:58,406
It has a great well

461
00:23:58,906 --> 00:24:02,546
It's very easy to navigate and

462
00:23:58,906 --> 00:24:02,546
It's very easy to navigate and

463
00:24:02,546 --> 00:24:04,136
for right from this main screen.

464
00:24:04,976 --> 00:24:07,076
And with one click

465
00:24:07,506 --> 00:24:09,006
you're instantly into a workout.

466
00:24:10,216 --> 00:24:10,746
That's it.

467
00:24:11,386 --> 00:24:13,126
Main screen to workout.

468
00:24:13,726 --> 00:24:14,716
It's that easy.

469
00:24:14,716 --> 00:24:17,376
And it's not overwhelming,

470
00:24:17,466 --> 00:24:19,806
because you don't want

471
00:24:19,806 --> 00:24:22,846
between you and getting fit.

472
00:24:23,056 --> 00:24:25,136
Zova does a great job

473
00:24:25,386 --> 00:24:28,086
because they use large graphics,

474
00:24:28,086 --> 00:24:29,926
on the content of the app.

475
00:24:30,776 --> 00:24:33,486
This app also does something

476
00:24:34,006 --> 00:24:38,706
If you put Zova in the top shelf

477
00:24:38,706 --> 00:24:40,916
to jump immediately

478
00:24:41,226 --> 00:24:44,096
because it uses dynamic

479
00:24:44,966 --> 00:24:46,836
If you want to find

480
00:24:46,836 --> 00:24:50,486
I will link to the Apple TV Tech

481
00:24:50,486 --> 00:24:52,906
So, that is Zova.

482
00:24:53,806 --> 00:25:00,206
This next app that I want to

483
00:24:53,806 --> 00:25:00,206
This next app that I want to

484
00:25:01,156 --> 00:25:04,756
And Reuters really

485
00:25:05,026 --> 00:25:06,066
on the Apple TV.

486
00:25:07,156 --> 00:25:09,746
If you think about traditional

487
00:25:09,746 --> 00:25:12,926
on you may be popping in five

488
00:25:12,926 --> 00:25:15,546
and you've already missed all of

489
00:25:16,506 --> 00:25:19,076
And I know you can

490
00:25:19,076 --> 00:25:21,696
from the internet, but

491
00:25:21,696 --> 00:25:26,026
to just watch a nice segment

492
00:25:26,026 --> 00:25:28,966
to know, well, wouldn't

493
00:25:30,116 --> 00:25:31,996
Well, that's exactly

494
00:25:32,836 --> 00:25:36,996
When you open this app you

495
00:25:37,806 --> 00:25:41,286
And that is, how much time do

496
00:25:42,446 --> 00:25:44,086
You make a single action.

497
00:25:44,426 --> 00:25:47,726
You choose whether that's

498
00:25:47,726 --> 00:25:49,376
And as soon as you select one,

499
00:25:49,816 --> 00:25:52,026
you are immediately

500
00:25:53,146 --> 00:25:55,296
You're given a quick

501
00:25:55,296 --> 00:25:58,326
in your playlist, and then

502
00:25:59,916 --> 00:26:02,496
If you wanted to swipe up

503
00:25:59,916 --> 00:26:02,496
If you wanted to swipe up

504
00:26:02,496 --> 00:26:04,746
you can jump to stories that

505
00:26:05,566 --> 00:26:09,346
And that's the beauty of

506
00:26:10,166 --> 00:26:13,156
Not only did I choose when

507
00:26:13,656 --> 00:26:15,486
but I was also easily

508
00:26:15,566 --> 00:26:17,716
to what I wanted

509
00:26:18,846 --> 00:26:21,496
This app makes it possible

510
00:26:23,216 --> 00:26:27,256
Now, while there's an amazing

511
00:26:27,256 --> 00:26:31,956
of this news content, the apps

512
00:26:31,956 --> 00:26:32,676
makes it great.

513
00:26:32,796 --> 00:26:33,466
All right.

514
00:26:34,536 --> 00:26:37,106
So, that is Reuters TV.

515
00:26:37,646 --> 00:26:40,246
Next up is a game.

516
00:26:40,246 --> 00:26:43,986
And this game is

517
00:26:44,886 --> 00:26:48,406
This is a colorful,

518
00:26:48,466 --> 00:26:50,036
and you may be familiar with it,

519
00:26:50,396 --> 00:26:52,316
because it is an ADA

520
00:26:53,016 --> 00:26:54,376
But, that's not why

521
00:26:54,546 --> 00:26:56,896
I have it here for a

522
00:26:58,006 --> 00:27:00,796
So, let's just say that I

523
00:26:58,006 --> 00:27:00,796
So, let's just say that I

524
00:27:00,796 --> 00:27:04,106
from the app store, and I've

525
00:27:05,516 --> 00:27:08,936
So, let's just see what

526
00:27:21,476 --> 00:27:22,536
Did you guys see that?

527
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:24,486
It was awesome.

528
00:27:24,866 --> 00:27:26,946
We were instantly into the game.

529
00:27:27,016 --> 00:27:28,266
We just started playing.

530
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:31,876
Right from launch you're in

531
00:27:32,076 --> 00:27:33,576
And that is awesome.

532
00:27:34,416 --> 00:27:36,776
So, now I just want to continue

533
00:27:36,776 --> 00:27:38,346
through this first

534
00:27:39,056 --> 00:27:42,306
because there's something

535
00:27:42,876 --> 00:27:47,166
You are reading a text,

536
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:49,466
on the Siri Remote, and

537
00:27:50,036 --> 00:27:51,346
all at the same time.

538
00:27:52,506 --> 00:27:54,186
The texting graphics are clear.

539
00:27:54,186 --> 00:27:57,846
So, you're able to play and

540
00:27:58,426 --> 00:27:59,836
And that is fantastic.

541
00:28:00,816 --> 00:28:02,816
So, let's just fast forward

542
00:28:03,296 --> 00:28:05,326
I assure you I landed

543
00:28:05,406 --> 00:28:08,426
and I only had to

544
00:28:08,626 --> 00:28:10,526
So, when you pass

545
00:28:10,526 --> 00:28:14,316
which is your first experience

546
00:28:14,316 --> 00:28:15,516
And you feel great.

547
00:28:15,996 --> 00:28:17,106
You feel accomplished.

548
00:28:17,576 --> 00:28:20,296
And now you're just

549
00:28:21,656 --> 00:28:24,356
Chameleon Run is so much

550
00:28:24,756 --> 00:28:26,236
It has great game play.

551
00:28:26,626 --> 00:28:28,376
And they support

552
00:28:29,196 --> 00:28:32,326
But, most of all I love

553
00:28:32,326 --> 00:28:35,246
to jump into the game.

554
00:28:35,446 --> 00:28:38,316
Now, granted not every single

555
00:28:38,756 --> 00:28:41,716
But, you should still

556
00:28:41,716 --> 00:28:45,046
to make your apps experience

557
00:28:45,096 --> 00:28:48,836
to as possible, because

558
00:28:49,006 --> 00:28:50,906
They just want to

559
00:28:51,496 --> 00:28:53,016
And that's Chameleon Run.

560
00:28:55,436 --> 00:28:57,966
This final app is unique.

561
00:28:58,616 --> 00:29:00,476
And it is called, Late Shift.

562
00:28:58,616 --> 00:29:00,476
And it is called, Late Shift.

563
00:29:02,156 --> 00:29:03,926
This is a cinematic game

564
00:29:04,236 --> 00:29:06,256
that lets you control

565
00:29:07,276 --> 00:29:10,506
Decisions you make change

566
00:29:11,146 --> 00:29:13,276
And if you want to watch

567
00:29:13,606 --> 00:29:16,016
there's a companion app for the

568
00:29:16,016 --> 00:29:17,296
and make decisions together.

569
00:29:18,766 --> 00:29:21,596
So, potentially you

570
00:29:21,596 --> 00:29:23,256
that then turns into

571
00:29:23,766 --> 00:29:26,756
This is a

572
00:29:26,786 --> 00:29:30,806
with a really easy

573
00:29:31,216 --> 00:29:33,096
and a very simple

574
00:29:33,216 --> 00:29:37,506
And the majority of your

575
00:29:38,126 --> 00:29:40,836
And this game play is

576
00:29:41,316 --> 00:29:43,816
You control the movie's

577
00:29:44,936 --> 00:29:46,316
The onboarding is integrated

578
00:29:46,316 --> 00:29:47,826
into the first level's

579
00:29:48,126 --> 00:29:50,456
And it lets you know

580
00:29:51,716 --> 00:29:54,436
Late Shift is an intriguing,

581
00:29:54,686 --> 00:29:57,386
that I'm really excited

582
00:29:57,386 --> 00:29:58,856
in apps on the Apple TV.

583
00:30:01,566 --> 00:30:06,676
So, we just took a look at

584
00:30:07,706 --> 00:30:10,426
an auto-runner, and an

585
00:30:11,626 --> 00:30:13,396
So, what do all these

586
00:30:14,726 --> 00:30:17,126
Well, they all design for

587
00:30:18,436 --> 00:30:19,936
But, they also really thought

588
00:30:19,976 --> 00:30:24,556
about what their app could do

589
00:30:24,726 --> 00:30:26,676
While we've gone through

590
00:30:27,206 --> 00:30:29,636
remember that TV's are not

591
00:30:30,536 --> 00:30:32,976
They're in classrooms,

592
00:30:33,186 --> 00:30:35,276
conferences, airports, and more.

593
00:30:36,356 --> 00:30:39,466
So, what do you want your

594
00:30:40,506 --> 00:30:42,276
You need to get into the mindset

595
00:30:42,576 --> 00:30:44,556
of what you want

596
00:30:44,616 --> 00:30:48,716
And then how to elevate

597
00:30:48,906 --> 00:30:50,806
This is not a traditional

598
00:30:51,246 --> 00:30:53,316
so why have a traditional

599
00:30:54,116 --> 00:30:57,386
We are on the precipice

600
00:30:58,016 --> 00:31:00,596
And the TV deserves

601
00:30:58,016 --> 00:31:00,596
And the TV deserves

602
00:31:01,676 --> 00:31:04,886
because you can create

603
00:31:05,586 --> 00:31:07,076
that people will love.

604
00:31:08,436 --> 00:31:10,616
So, if there's just one

605
00:31:10,616 --> 00:31:15,986
from this talk today

606
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:21,556
For more information including

607
00:31:21,556 --> 00:31:23,816
of this session,

608
00:31:24,056 --> 00:31:25,636
This is has been session 802.

609
00:31:26,916 --> 00:31:29,176
And there are a lot of

610
00:31:29,176 --> 00:31:32,236
including the Typography and

611
00:31:32,236 --> 00:31:34,046
on tvOS Talk that I mentioned.

612
00:31:34,876 --> 00:31:37,566
And there's a great design

613
00:31:37,566 --> 00:31:41,526
at 10 AM, here on this stage,

614
00:31:41,906 --> 00:31:44,346
And if you have an idea for

615
00:31:44,346 --> 00:31:47,446
to get started, that would

616
00:31:48,216 --> 00:31:49,996
This has been Designing

617
00:31:50,276 --> 00:31:51,316
Have a great conference.

618
