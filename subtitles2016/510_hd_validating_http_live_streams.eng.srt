00:00:20,046 --> 00:00:21,486
&gt;&gt; Hello. Welcome

3
00:00:21,486 --> 00:00:24,026
on Validating HTTP Live Streams.

4
00:00:24,556 --> 00:00:25,536
My name is Eryk.

5
00:00:25,616 --> 00:00:27,316
I'm a media engineer at Apple.

6
00:00:27,526 --> 00:00:28,336
Let's get started.

7
00:00:28,756 --> 00:00:31,766
What are we doing when

8
00:00:32,046 --> 00:00:34,206
We're trying to ensure

9
00:00:34,436 --> 00:00:35,946
At least in terms

10
00:00:36,766 --> 00:00:39,566
Structural checks can't find

11
00:00:39,566 --> 00:00:41,736
but it will eliminate

12
00:00:42,526 --> 00:00:46,606
To be more precise, we first

13
00:00:46,606 --> 00:00:47,886
to be properly formatted.

14
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:51,486
That is, is the software going

15
00:00:52,526 --> 00:00:54,896
Second, we have some

16
00:00:55,076 --> 00:00:58,926
For example, the HLS spec does

17
00:00:59,006 --> 00:01:00,686
But we want to require them,

18
00:00:59,006 --> 00:01:00,686
But we want to require them,

19
00:01:00,876 --> 00:01:03,006
because they improve the

20
00:01:03,996 --> 00:01:05,756
Third, we want these streams

21
00:01:05,756 --> 00:01:08,366
to reflect established

22
00:01:09,676 --> 00:01:12,336
Ultimately, this

23
00:01:12,336 --> 00:01:15,546
of making sure the stream

24
00:01:17,376 --> 00:01:20,236
So let's talk about the

25
00:01:21,506 --> 00:01:24,756
The most important is the

26
00:01:25,226 --> 00:01:28,136
If you've been working with

27
00:01:28,216 --> 00:01:30,296
you've probably read this

28
00:01:31,116 --> 00:01:34,976
It is an Internet

29
00:01:35,036 --> 00:01:36,756
IETF, internet draft.

30
00:01:37,506 --> 00:01:39,176
You can find it just

31
00:01:39,176 --> 00:01:40,966
on the web for "draft pantos".

32
00:01:41,806 --> 00:01:44,266
The first version was

33
00:01:45,006 --> 00:01:46,986
We updated two or

34
00:01:47,366 --> 00:01:49,676
It details the structure

35
00:01:49,856 --> 00:01:52,126
What kinds of tags

36
00:01:52,586 --> 00:01:54,136
And explains the

37
00:01:54,136 --> 00:01:55,806
for the clients and the server.

38
00:01:57,636 --> 00:02:00,546
More recently we

39
00:01:57,636 --> 00:02:00,546
More recently we

40
00:02:00,546 --> 00:02:02,266
The HLS Authoring Specification.

41
00:02:03,106 --> 00:02:06,016
This is available in

42
00:02:06,266 --> 00:02:09,506
We first published it

43
00:02:09,626 --> 00:02:14,716
For WWDC, we've updated it to

44
00:02:15,416 --> 00:02:18,886
This document tries to cover

45
00:02:18,886 --> 00:02:19,746
HLS content.

46
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:23,876
The requirements

47
00:02:23,876 --> 00:02:26,696
in the authoring specification

48
00:02:27,436 --> 00:02:30,816
Some echo requirements

49
00:02:30,966 --> 00:02:33,886
For example, where

50
00:02:33,886 --> 00:02:36,336
What your playlist

51
00:02:36,976 --> 00:02:38,756
Some have to do with

52
00:02:38,876 --> 00:02:42,416
For example, that all your

53
00:02:42,826 --> 00:02:45,796
Or that you can't have more than

54
00:02:47,006 --> 00:02:49,426
Others come from the

55
00:02:49,676 --> 00:02:53,356
For example, the I-Frame

56
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:55,676
Or, the fact that we want

57
00:02:56,826 --> 00:03:00,116
A number are informed

58
00:02:56,826 --> 00:03:00,116
A number are informed

59
00:03:00,116 --> 00:03:02,486
of our experience

60
00:03:02,946 --> 00:03:05,946
I'm talking about the

61
00:03:05,946 --> 00:03:06,916
around delivery.

62
00:03:07,216 --> 00:03:08,626
The bitrates we recommend.

63
00:03:08,976 --> 00:03:12,016
And our recommendations

64
00:03:14,196 --> 00:03:18,106
The requirements I've listed

65
00:03:18,106 --> 00:03:20,406
to give you a flavor of

66
00:03:20,576 --> 00:03:24,016
The specification itself

67
00:03:24,016 --> 00:03:25,316
Like video encoding.

68
00:03:25,476 --> 00:03:26,076
Trick Play.

69
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:27,526
Media segmentation.

70
00:03:27,726 --> 00:03:30,906
Delivery and so on.

71
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:33,226
Now of course we

72
00:03:33,226 --> 00:03:34,926
to do this validation by hand.

73
00:03:35,146 --> 00:03:37,396
So let's look at the

74
00:03:38,086 --> 00:03:40,876
But first, you need

75
00:03:41,126 --> 00:03:44,216
Everything important about

76
00:03:44,216 --> 00:03:48,646
at the developer streaming page,

77
00:03:49,746 --> 00:03:51,556
Now if we scroll

78
00:03:51,556 --> 00:03:53,706
halfway down on the

79
00:03:53,706 --> 00:03:54,676
to the "Tools" download.

80
00:03:55,546 --> 00:03:58,596
Now please note you

81
00:03:58,596 --> 00:04:00,606
in with a developer

82
00:03:58,596 --> 00:04:00,606
in with a developer

83
00:04:00,606 --> 00:04:02,236
in order to access this page.

84
00:04:02,586 --> 00:04:05,026
But remember that

85
00:04:05,486 --> 00:04:08,916
Now once you've done that, you

86
00:04:09,556 --> 00:04:12,106
The download itself

87
00:04:12,106 --> 00:04:13,916
which contains an

88
00:04:14,646 --> 00:04:16,736
Now the screenshot here

89
00:04:16,736 --> 00:04:21,016
You should see a newer disk

90
00:04:21,716 --> 00:04:24,556
We do typically update the

91
00:04:25,396 --> 00:04:27,926
Now by the way, if you are

92
00:04:27,926 --> 00:04:31,886
the new version may not

93
00:04:32,436 --> 00:04:35,706
After you've run the installer,

94
00:04:36,136 --> 00:04:39,806
And I want to remind you that

95
00:04:40,826 --> 00:04:43,846
The first two -- the

96
00:04:43,846 --> 00:04:44,986
in the rest of this talk.

97
00:04:45,946 --> 00:04:49,286
The next three tools are

98
00:04:49,496 --> 00:04:51,346
streams, and subtitles.

99
00:04:51,766 --> 00:04:54,066
And I wanted to mention

100
00:04:54,066 --> 00:04:57,256
that the subtitle segmenter

101
00:04:57,256 --> 00:05:04,526
up the large web VTTT into a

102
00:04:57,256 --> 00:05:04,526
up the large web VTTT into a

103
00:05:05,256 --> 00:05:08,926
The last two tools, Variant

104
00:05:08,926 --> 00:05:10,756
to create master playlists.

105
00:05:11,546 --> 00:05:16,446
And the last one is used

106
00:05:16,676 --> 00:05:19,236
that you can then insert

107
00:05:19,806 --> 00:05:21,866
Now all of these tools

108
00:05:22,316 --> 00:05:25,636
And you can pass any of these

109
00:05:28,366 --> 00:05:30,746
But before we talk about

110
00:05:30,746 --> 00:05:33,156
I want to make a short pitch

111
00:05:33,926 --> 00:05:36,446
It's simple to call, you

112
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:40,456
It produces a media

113
00:05:40,996 --> 00:05:42,736
While this tool has

114
00:05:42,736 --> 00:05:44,696
it's not as complicated

115
00:05:45,306 --> 00:05:47,466
The options break

116
00:05:48,716 --> 00:05:50,616
Options having to do

117
00:05:50,616 --> 00:05:52,146
With structuring playlists.

118
00:05:53,046 --> 00:05:57,916
How to do encryption and so on.

119
00:05:57,916 --> 00:05:59,706
Even if you don't use

120
00:05:59,856 --> 00:06:02,326
the mediafilesegmenter

121
00:05:59,856 --> 00:06:02,326
the mediafilesegmenter

122
00:06:02,326 --> 00:06:04,616
on whatever process

123
00:06:07,056 --> 00:06:08,406
So on to validation.

124
00:06:09,306 --> 00:06:11,626
Media stream validator

125
00:06:12,606 --> 00:06:14,936
You can call it with

126
00:06:17,186 --> 00:06:21,186
And it produces output on the

127
00:06:21,656 --> 00:06:24,496
Now this json contains

128
00:06:24,496 --> 00:06:27,146
in the output, and

129
00:06:28,336 --> 00:06:32,186
A couple of options

130
00:06:32,716 --> 00:06:34,356
First of all you

131
00:06:34,356 --> 00:06:35,896
and the name of the json file.

132
00:06:36,226 --> 00:06:39,106
And you can adjust the timeout.

133
00:06:39,546 --> 00:06:40,906
Well, what's the timeout?

134
00:06:41,346 --> 00:06:43,226
By default, the validator

135
00:06:43,226 --> 00:06:45,786
That is, it stops

136
00:06:46,536 --> 00:06:48,036
Now this may not be enough time

137
00:06:48,036 --> 00:06:50,536
to process a big video

138
00:06:51,116 --> 00:06:54,086
And for live content,

139
00:06:54,086 --> 00:06:56,676
for your initial checks,

140
00:06:56,676 --> 00:06:58,816
over a much longer

141
00:06:58,816 --> 00:07:00,646
that the stream is

142
00:06:58,816 --> 00:07:00,646
that the stream is

143
00:07:03,836 --> 00:07:06,596
Here's what the media stream

144
00:07:07,976 --> 00:07:11,456
So here we're calling media

145
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:15,686
And first it tells you

146
00:07:16,006 --> 00:07:17,826
And then it outputs some trace

147
00:07:17,826 --> 00:07:19,986
as it's downloading

148
00:07:21,356 --> 00:07:26,046
And then it outputs information

149
00:07:26,046 --> 00:07:27,636
and I-Frame variant

150
00:07:28,336 --> 00:07:30,936
Now this can be hard to digest.

151
00:07:31,116 --> 00:07:33,866
So we created HLS report.

152
00:07:34,536 --> 00:07:38,126
This is a python script

153
00:07:38,216 --> 00:07:39,986
and summarizes and condenses it.

154
00:07:41,306 --> 00:07:44,056
And it produces an

155
00:07:45,316 --> 00:07:47,056
The name of that file

156
00:07:47,056 --> 00:07:49,846
of your json file, except

157
00:07:51,426 --> 00:07:54,056
And again, there are some

158
00:07:54,716 --> 00:07:56,936
We can change the

159
00:07:58,046 --> 00:08:02,886
The dash I or dash ID option

160
00:07:58,046 --> 00:08:02,886
The dash I or dash ID option

161
00:08:02,886 --> 00:08:07,096
to match HTML output to

162
00:08:07,096 --> 00:08:09,716
And I'll give you some more

163
00:08:09,716 --> 00:08:11,336
when I go through the examples.

164
00:08:12,456 --> 00:08:16,116
Now the verbose option

165
00:08:16,116 --> 00:08:17,796
that gives you a

166
00:08:17,796 --> 00:08:19,886
about every variant

167
00:08:20,286 --> 00:08:21,976
Unfortunately, I

168
00:08:21,976 --> 00:08:23,486
into detail about that output.

169
00:08:23,786 --> 00:08:26,556
But I wanted to call it out as

170
00:08:28,336 --> 00:08:30,636
One quick aside here.

171
00:08:31,176 --> 00:08:34,515
You should validate your

172
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:35,336
to the App Store.

173
00:08:36,126 --> 00:08:38,285
And also, when you

174
00:08:38,566 --> 00:08:42,066
you should include a test

175
00:08:42,066 --> 00:08:45,326
so that the reviewers have a

176
00:08:47,216 --> 00:08:49,516
I'd like to run some demos.

177
00:08:49,676 --> 00:08:52,986
But rather than run all this

178
00:08:52,986 --> 00:08:55,016
to follow along and

179
00:08:55,266 --> 00:08:59,386
I've captured the output and

180
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:01,496
First, a little command

181
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:01,496
First, a little command

182
00:09:03,356 --> 00:09:04,996
Run media stream validator.

183
00:09:05,036 --> 00:09:07,766
And notice I'm giving the

184
00:09:08,486 --> 00:09:11,596
And I've just got a fake URL

185
00:09:12,526 --> 00:09:16,256
Now we've seen the output

186
00:09:16,456 --> 00:09:19,076
But remember that this might

187
00:09:22,346 --> 00:09:25,496
Now once it's completed,

188
00:09:25,626 --> 00:09:28,476
Passing at the json that media

189
00:09:30,516 --> 00:09:34,306
If HLS report works well,

190
00:09:34,376 --> 00:09:36,086
Just the HTML file.

191
00:09:37,306 --> 00:09:38,966
So if we look in our

192
00:09:39,686 --> 00:09:41,476
we'll see there are

193
00:09:41,866 --> 00:09:44,186
The json that media

194
00:09:44,556 --> 00:09:47,646
And the HTML file that

195
00:09:49,156 --> 00:09:51,956
So let's take a look at

196
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,566
First, I'm going to

197
00:09:54,566 --> 00:09:56,416
that has several common errors.

198
00:09:57,856 --> 00:10:00,046
This is what a report

199
00:09:57,856 --> 00:10:00,046
This is what a report

200
00:10:01,076 --> 00:10:03,746
The first thing you want to

201
00:10:06,296 --> 00:10:09,956
Now usually, this is

202
00:10:11,106 --> 00:10:13,016
These reflect a three kind --

203
00:10:13,016 --> 00:10:17,476
basic kinds of streams

204
00:10:18,116 --> 00:10:20,446
But you could get

205
00:10:20,446 --> 00:10:24,356
And this means that we weren't

206
00:10:24,406 --> 00:10:27,196
Or worse, you could

207
00:10:27,646 --> 00:10:31,316
Now this can mean that

208
00:10:31,346 --> 00:10:35,386
That is, that some of the media

209
00:10:35,636 --> 00:10:38,826
Or worse, it could be that you

210
00:10:38,826 --> 00:10:43,096
Like for example, some of your

211
00:10:43,096 --> 00:10:44,466
and some claim to be LIVE.

212
00:10:47,266 --> 00:10:50,946
Now the next item in the report

213
00:10:51,356 --> 00:10:54,056
It has one entry for

214
00:10:55,156 --> 00:10:59,056
Now if we happened to have

215
00:10:59,056 --> 00:11:01,386
that will be an added

216
00:10:59,056 --> 00:11:01,386
that will be an added

217
00:11:01,386 --> 00:11:03,136
that indicates the

218
00:11:03,366 --> 00:11:05,186
If we look over to the right,

219
00:11:05,726 --> 00:11:07,716
we can see that there

220
00:11:07,766 --> 00:11:10,396
And in particular, if

221
00:11:10,396 --> 00:11:12,976
to have a percent

222
00:11:13,226 --> 00:11:16,826
Now if this is less than 100%,

223
00:11:16,826 --> 00:11:19,256
that means that the

224
00:11:19,856 --> 00:11:21,946
Now if you have live content,

225
00:11:22,046 --> 00:11:24,396
you won't see the

226
00:11:24,396 --> 00:11:25,986
Instead you'll see two columns.

227
00:11:26,316 --> 00:11:28,896
Average segment count, and

228
00:11:30,226 --> 00:11:31,096
Now the next thing you want

229
00:11:31,096 --> 00:11:33,686
to check is the percent

230
00:11:34,286 --> 00:11:37,256
This shows you how much

231
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:39,906
than the value that was

232
00:11:40,716 --> 00:11:42,586
Now these values

233
00:11:42,586 --> 00:11:48,236
Notice that variant one has a --

234
00:11:48,496 --> 00:11:51,836
Now these values

235
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:54,686
of minus 10% to positive 10%.

236
00:11:55,466 --> 00:11:57,956
If the value here is positive,

237
00:11:58,306 --> 00:12:00,876
that means your declared

238
00:11:58,306 --> 00:12:00,876
that means your declared

239
00:12:01,306 --> 00:12:02,736
And if the value is negative,

240
00:12:02,926 --> 00:12:05,356
your declared value should

241
00:12:05,776 --> 00:12:08,746
Now notice we've

242
00:12:08,746 --> 00:12:12,186
Because in our playlist we

243
00:12:12,186 --> 00:12:13,336
and the average bandwidth.

244
00:12:13,876 --> 00:12:16,396
We are able to compare

245
00:12:16,396 --> 00:12:17,896
and measured values for both.

246
00:12:18,786 --> 00:12:21,986
Now sometimes looking

247
00:12:21,986 --> 00:12:24,616
of percentage can

248
00:12:24,616 --> 00:12:26,306
to see what the real

249
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:32,146
So if you add the -- pl

250
00:12:32,746 --> 00:12:38,936
to your HLS report command line,

251
00:12:39,726 --> 00:12:40,476
Playlist rate.

252
00:12:40,826 --> 00:12:42,326
And playlist average rate.

253
00:12:43,316 --> 00:12:46,596
So with this, we can see that

254
00:12:46,926 --> 00:12:50,036
the declared value is

255
00:12:50,566 --> 00:12:55,236
But the measured value was

256
00:12:55,636 --> 00:12:58,336
Now let's switch back to a

257
00:12:58,336 --> 00:12:59,256
and scroll down a bit.

258
00:13:00,076 --> 00:13:02,466
There's another table,

259
00:13:03,796 --> 00:13:07,216
In this master playlist we have

260
00:13:07,866 --> 00:13:10,356
That makes it a rendition,

261
00:13:13,516 --> 00:13:17,056
Following this, we have

262
00:13:17,736 --> 00:13:19,976
Now must fix issues are things

263
00:13:19,976 --> 00:13:22,416
which are essential

264
00:13:22,796 --> 00:13:24,766
Or things which we

265
00:13:24,766 --> 00:13:26,426
that we made them

266
00:13:27,946 --> 00:13:33,146
You see item #2 and #4 here are

267
00:13:33,536 --> 00:13:35,716
The fact that the peak

268
00:13:36,026 --> 00:13:38,426
that the declared and

269
00:13:40,046 --> 00:13:43,216
Now item 3 we'll address

270
00:13:44,956 --> 00:13:47,936
Scrolling down farther, we now

271
00:13:48,476 --> 00:13:50,026
Should fix issues are things

272
00:13:50,026 --> 00:13:54,046
which we strongly

273
00:13:54,256 --> 00:13:57,296
Now these are followed lastly

274
00:13:57,296 --> 00:14:01,716
The report information is

275
00:13:57,296 --> 00:14:01,716
The report information is

276
00:14:02,116 --> 00:14:04,316
to which version of

277
00:14:04,356 --> 00:14:05,976
and HLS report was used.

278
00:14:06,146 --> 00:14:09,956
This is important if you

279
00:14:10,126 --> 00:14:13,046
the output from HLS report.

280
00:14:13,576 --> 00:14:16,646
Or if you're even going back

281
00:14:17,196 --> 00:14:20,526
after you've downloaded a more

282
00:14:21,506 --> 00:14:26,116
Now item 5 here is telling us

283
00:14:26,116 --> 00:14:28,916
or subtitles in our playlist.

284
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:30,956
We'll fix this in

285
00:14:31,956 --> 00:14:33,566
Let's look at item number 7.

286
00:14:34,876 --> 00:14:40,286
So item number 7 says that our

287
00:14:40,286 --> 00:14:42,616
what we suggest.

288
00:14:43,856 --> 00:14:47,186
And it's telling us

289
00:14:48,816 --> 00:14:51,266
So let's scroll back up

290
00:14:51,406 --> 00:14:55,396
And we can see that item #8 has

291
00:14:55,886 --> 00:14:57,736
That's how we can tell

292
00:14:57,736 --> 00:15:00,356
Now remember the default

293
00:14:57,736 --> 00:15:00,356
Now remember the default

294
00:15:00,356 --> 00:15:02,076
that the client's going

295
00:15:03,436 --> 00:15:05,606
It's the first variant

296
00:15:06,376 --> 00:15:10,236
And notice that this one, the

297
00:15:10,236 --> 00:15:12,636
That's way too high

298
00:15:16,186 --> 00:15:20,026
Okay. Those are some common

299
00:15:20,106 --> 00:15:23,576
In our second example, we've

300
00:15:23,576 --> 00:15:25,166
and fixed the problems

301
00:15:26,686 --> 00:15:30,216
We've adjusted the

302
00:15:30,216 --> 00:15:33,346
so now the percent

303
00:15:34,336 --> 00:15:36,036
We've fixed the default variant

304
00:15:36,256 --> 00:15:39,176
to be something more reasonable

305
00:15:39,176 --> 00:15:43,106
by moving a different media

306
00:15:43,106 --> 00:15:44,286
in the master playlist.

307
00:15:46,026 --> 00:15:47,966
And if we look over on

308
00:15:48,196 --> 00:15:51,236
we fixed our timeout, so

309
00:15:51,236 --> 00:15:52,396
entire playlist.

310
00:15:54,056 --> 00:15:57,736
Now we had a should fix

311
00:15:58,076 --> 00:16:00,516
We fixed that by adding

312
00:15:58,076 --> 00:16:00,516
We fixed that by adding

313
00:16:01,376 --> 00:16:05,146
Now notice as a subtitle's

314
00:16:05,466 --> 00:16:07,806
doesn't have a max

315
00:16:08,896 --> 00:16:11,986
That's because the subtitle

316
00:16:12,446 --> 00:16:15,656
And we put an n/a over in

317
00:16:15,656 --> 00:16:17,896
to remind us that

318
00:16:19,466 --> 00:16:22,826
But we still have

319
00:16:22,986 --> 00:16:25,176
and that's no I-Frame playlist.

320
00:16:27,136 --> 00:16:32,146
So how does the report change

321
00:16:32,566 --> 00:16:35,486
The first part looks the

322
00:16:36,696 --> 00:16:39,156
Now, in addition to the

323
00:16:39,156 --> 00:16:41,026
there's an I-Frame

324
00:16:41,746 --> 00:16:43,996
Now notice we're a little off

325
00:16:43,996 --> 00:16:45,836
on our percent difference

326
00:16:45,836 --> 00:16:47,716
But these are well

327
00:16:48,076 --> 00:16:50,096
Remember, that's +/- 10%.

328
00:16:51,646 --> 00:16:54,246
Now let's talk about these

329
00:16:54,606 --> 00:16:56,446
Scaled average and multiplier.

330
00:16:57,156 --> 00:17:01,276
Scaled average is the affective

331
00:16:57,156 --> 00:17:01,276
Scaled average is the affective

332
00:17:01,276 --> 00:17:02,556
of the I-Frame playlist.

333
00:17:03,646 --> 00:17:04,866
Yeah, that's kind of a mouthful.

334
00:17:05,636 --> 00:17:06,866
Remember that the measured,

335
00:17:06,866 --> 00:17:10,046
average bit rate

336
00:17:10,675 --> 00:17:12,796
at a 1 X playback speed.

337
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:17,086
But the whole point of I-Frames

338
00:17:17,086 --> 00:17:18,996
at greater than 1 X speed.

339
00:17:19,526 --> 00:17:23,705
Now the multiplier tells

340
00:17:23,925 --> 00:17:26,165
at which we will hit

341
00:17:27,286 --> 00:17:29,206
Higher rates are

342
00:17:29,206 --> 00:17:31,476
because we will drop

343
00:17:31,476 --> 00:17:35,266
to keep the actual displayed

344
00:17:36,036 --> 00:17:39,496
What you should do with these

345
00:17:39,496 --> 00:17:43,836
average data rate here, against

346
00:17:43,926 --> 00:17:45,316
that has the same resolution.

347
00:17:46,446 --> 00:17:48,166
These should be close in value,

348
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:51,446
or the I-Frame variant

349
00:17:51,996 --> 00:17:55,936
Otherwise, Trick Play could

350
00:17:59,216 --> 00:18:02,966
Now in this report, I've

351
00:17:59,216 --> 00:18:02,966
Now in this report, I've

352
00:18:03,446 --> 00:18:07,276
That's because I added the

353
00:18:07,876 --> 00:18:10,226
Now as I mentioned before,

354
00:18:10,226 --> 00:18:12,966
this helps you find the

355
00:18:13,776 --> 00:18:17,676
So let's look for this

356
00:18:17,676 --> 00:18:20,346
Which is our lowest

357
00:18:20,526 --> 00:18:21,936
Let's look for that in the json.

358
00:18:24,296 --> 00:18:27,696
So here's an abbreviated

359
00:18:27,956 --> 00:18:30,186
The top level of the

360
00:18:30,636 --> 00:18:33,026
And we're interested

361
00:18:33,386 --> 00:18:35,386
Which is an array

362
00:18:38,076 --> 00:18:42,066
Now one of those dictionaries

363
00:18:42,856 --> 00:18:45,926
And I want to note here

364
00:18:45,926 --> 00:18:48,206
that these are not

365
00:18:50,506 --> 00:18:53,086
Now this one with data ID 16,

366
00:18:53,086 --> 00:18:57,036
that's the json variant entry

367
00:18:57,036 --> 00:18:57,836
in the report.

368
00:18:57,836 --> 00:18:59,786
That is the lowest

369
00:19:00,596 --> 00:19:02,146
Now, I've skipped

370
00:19:02,436 --> 00:19:05,096
There's much more information

371
00:19:06,026 --> 00:19:08,656
Use your favorite tool for

372
00:19:08,656 --> 00:19:10,686
or write yourself some

373
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:13,516
Now, these json's

374
00:19:13,516 --> 00:19:18,966
It's not uncommon for them to

375
00:19:19,816 --> 00:19:23,506
For our last example,

376
00:19:23,506 --> 00:19:26,946
and we added multiple

377
00:19:27,216 --> 00:19:29,006
So the top looks pretty similar.

378
00:19:29,216 --> 00:19:32,986
Let's scroll down and

379
00:19:33,556 --> 00:19:36,026
Now, rather than just

380
00:19:36,026 --> 00:19:39,646
we've added two multi-channel

381
00:19:40,216 --> 00:19:43,026
One is AC-3 that

382
00:19:43,236 --> 00:19:44,906
That one's called the aud2.

383
00:19:45,746 --> 00:19:49,276
And one is EC-3,

384
00:19:50,176 --> 00:19:51,176
One we call aud3.

385
00:19:51,596 --> 00:19:53,926
So let's go up and look

386
00:19:55,926 --> 00:20:02,696
Now, notice that because AC-3

387
00:19:55,926 --> 00:20:02,696
Now, notice that because AC-3

388
00:20:03,046 --> 00:20:05,836
and neither are they

389
00:20:06,236 --> 00:20:09,406
each one has its

390
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:14,966
That is, once we

391
00:20:15,046 --> 00:20:17,166
we will default to variant #12.

392
00:20:17,486 --> 00:20:20,756
Because that variant is the

393
00:20:20,846 --> 00:20:22,466
that appears in the

394
00:20:23,926 --> 00:20:29,486
Similarly, if we chose EC-3, we

395
00:20:30,436 --> 00:20:32,356
Now notice there's

396
00:20:32,406 --> 00:20:34,716
between the aud2

397
00:20:34,766 --> 00:20:39,546
For example, variant

398
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:42,976
This is due to the different

399
00:20:43,186 --> 00:20:44,966
The bitrate you'll see here

400
00:20:44,966 --> 00:20:48,666
for the variant is the

401
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:49,496
the renditions.

402
00:20:51,206 --> 00:20:53,616
Okay. That's it for my examples.

403
00:20:54,016 --> 00:20:56,616
Where can you find some

404
00:20:58,336 --> 00:21:01,046
Well, there are three

405
00:20:58,336 --> 00:21:01,046
Well, there are three

406
00:21:01,046 --> 00:21:02,166
of the streaming page.

407
00:21:02,246 --> 00:21:05,256
If you go to

408
00:21:05,626 --> 00:21:07,266
there's a pointer to

409
00:21:07,586 --> 00:21:10,396
And you could dig the

410
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:14,236
Or, you could just read

411
00:21:15,346 --> 00:21:18,366
The first two will have

412
00:21:18,556 --> 00:21:21,816
That's because these streams

413
00:21:21,816 --> 00:21:23,826
and we deliberately

414
00:21:24,286 --> 00:21:26,206
But that third variant

415
00:21:26,206 --> 00:21:27,766
and should be almost perfect.

416
00:21:29,516 --> 00:21:32,096
All right, it's time to wrap up.

417
00:21:33,246 --> 00:21:36,436
Here are the only three things I

418
00:21:37,286 --> 00:21:40,566
Obey the authoring spec.

419
00:21:40,566 --> 00:21:41,986
validate your streams.

420
00:21:42,586 --> 00:21:48,606
And include a test stream

421
00:21:49,076 --> 00:21:52,936
For more information,

422
00:21:52,936 --> 00:21:57,906
and use this session's

423
00:21:58,546 --> 00:22:01,306
There's a lot of cool

424
00:21:58,546 --> 00:22:01,306
There's a lot of cool

425
00:22:01,306 --> 00:22:02,806
in HTTP live streaming.

426
00:22:02,806 --> 00:22:07,776
So I encourage you to

427
00:22:07,776 --> 00:22:10,036
What's New in HTTP

428
00:22:10,426 --> 00:22:11,976
Thank you, and have
