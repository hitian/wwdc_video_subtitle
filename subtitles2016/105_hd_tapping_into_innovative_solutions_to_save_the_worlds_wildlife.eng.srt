00:02:10,045 --> 00:02:12,826
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon, well I'm

9
00:02:13,776 --> 00:02:17,336
because this is not the type

10
00:02:17,556 --> 00:02:20,296
I'm not a developer,

11
00:02:20,536 --> 00:02:22,316
I'm head of Wildlife

12
00:02:22,316 --> 00:02:26,006
at World Wildlife Fund, which is

13
00:02:26,236 --> 00:02:30,756
globally to protect wild

14
00:02:31,116 --> 00:02:33,986
and to reduce the human

15
00:02:34,816 --> 00:02:37,796
WWF has been around

16
00:02:38,426 --> 00:02:41,856
We work in more than 100

17
00:02:41,856 --> 00:02:44,046
than 6 million members

18
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:47,796
I'm usually talking to audiences

19
00:02:48,426 --> 00:02:52,556
or policymakers like congress

20
00:02:52,966 --> 00:02:55,276
But one of the things

21
00:02:55,276 --> 00:02:58,826
about today is how we're

22
00:02:58,826 --> 00:03:02,126
to help save the planet and

23
00:02:58,826 --> 00:03:02,126
to help save the planet and

24
00:03:02,126 --> 00:03:05,036
And it may surprise you to hear

25
00:03:05,036 --> 00:03:08,506
and new ways we're using

26
00:03:08,886 --> 00:03:14,336
But first, I want to

27
00:03:14,976 --> 00:03:15,766
at the state of the planet.

28
00:03:16,816 --> 00:03:19,156
We don't hear a lot of good

29
00:03:19,756 --> 00:03:23,236
we are in fact facing

30
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:25,516
of the world's most

31
00:03:27,176 --> 00:03:32,016
But we're also on the cusp of

32
00:03:32,516 --> 00:03:34,576
and I'm going to tell you

33
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:38,906
But first, here's the backdrop.

34
00:03:39,576 --> 00:03:41,556
Our living planet

35
00:03:41,636 --> 00:03:46,026
that in the last 40 years

36
00:03:46,776 --> 00:03:48,446
of the world's vertebrate

37
00:03:49,146 --> 00:03:53,816
That's mammals, birds,

38
00:03:54,626 --> 00:03:58,436
It's affecting many of our most

39
00:03:58,556 --> 00:04:00,046
and tigers and elephants.

40
00:03:58,556 --> 00:04:00,046
and tigers and elephants.

41
00:04:01,926 --> 00:04:02,836
Why is this happening?

42
00:04:03,786 --> 00:04:07,846
The reason it's happening

43
00:04:07,846 --> 00:04:12,996
and degradation and

44
00:04:14,036 --> 00:04:18,336
Habitat loss is driven mainly

45
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:22,005
to growing human numbers,

46
00:04:22,106 --> 00:04:25,766
and for commodities like

47
00:04:26,536 --> 00:04:30,646
Also developing infrastructure

48
00:04:31,846 --> 00:04:33,606
and generally growing

49
00:04:34,216 --> 00:04:38,316
And climate change is only

50
00:04:39,706 --> 00:04:42,116
by creating increased

51
00:04:42,186 --> 00:04:45,316
such as more intense

52
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:47,336
which is impacting

53
00:04:47,646 --> 00:04:49,586
including wildlife migrations

54
00:04:50,186 --> 00:04:53,906
and seasonal breeding

55
00:04:54,406 --> 00:04:57,986
Now simultaneously a

56
00:04:58,386 --> 00:05:00,776
in wildlife products

57
00:04:58,386 --> 00:05:00,776
in wildlife products

58
00:05:00,776 --> 00:05:02,306
of our most endangered species.

59
00:05:03,396 --> 00:05:08,696
This is a trade that is valued

60
00:05:08,936 --> 00:05:10,256
in wildlife and wildlife

61
00:05:11,006 --> 00:05:13,616
Which makes it one of the

62
00:05:13,616 --> 00:05:17,646
in the world amazingly

63
00:05:18,336 --> 00:05:19,436
and human trafficking.

64
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:25,856
And it's taking its toll on some

65
00:05:26,736 --> 00:05:30,356
For example, a surge

66
00:05:30,576 --> 00:05:32,966
in recent years has led

67
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:35,896
as 30,000 elephants a year.

68
00:05:36,546 --> 00:05:39,636
Are traded for their ivory,

69
00:05:39,636 --> 00:05:41,836
in Asia, but also here

70
00:05:42,716 --> 00:05:45,076
We are a major wildlife

71
00:05:45,076 --> 00:05:46,406
which surprises a lot of people.

72
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:53,166
By the time I finish this talk

73
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:55,476
killed illegally

74
00:05:58,256 --> 00:06:06,206
Now surge in poaching of rhinos

75
00:05:58,256 --> 00:06:06,206
Now surge in poaching of rhinos

76
00:06:06,206 --> 00:06:11,076
over the last decade from

77
00:06:11,276 --> 00:06:14,246
to over 1200 killed last year.

78
00:06:14,886 --> 00:06:19,066
This is driven by

79
00:06:19,066 --> 00:06:22,736
but also in China where rhino

80
00:06:22,736 --> 00:06:27,236
for cancer and unbelievably

81
00:06:27,236 --> 00:06:31,626
And this latter use is a

82
00:06:31,626 --> 00:06:34,366
in any kind of traditional

83
00:06:34,366 --> 00:06:37,496
of these uses has any

84
00:06:38,056 --> 00:06:42,846
And in the last century

85
00:06:42,846 --> 00:06:46,486
of the world's wild

86
00:06:46,486 --> 00:06:48,566
as few as 3900 in the wild.

87
00:06:48,816 --> 00:06:52,506
Tigers are killed illegally for

88
00:06:52,506 --> 00:06:54,246
and other body parts,

89
00:06:54,246 --> 00:06:55,496
in modern-day health tonics.

90
00:06:56,896 --> 00:07:00,226
So it's a pretty grim

91
00:06:56,896 --> 00:07:00,226
So it's a pretty grim

92
00:07:00,616 --> 00:07:03,196
and people often ask me well

93
00:07:03,196 --> 00:07:04,896
discouraged all the

94
00:07:04,896 --> 00:07:07,986
with these horrifying statistics

95
00:07:07,986 --> 00:07:08,996
in the wrong direction.

96
00:07:10,016 --> 00:07:13,306
And my response is well yes,

97
00:07:13,306 --> 00:07:16,576
for sure, but we're making

98
00:07:16,726 --> 00:07:19,166
some of these trends are

99
00:07:19,246 --> 00:07:25,136
And that is because I believe

100
00:07:25,376 --> 00:07:28,926
I'm going to talk to you today

101
00:07:29,706 --> 00:07:33,566
the power of technology, and

102
00:07:34,066 --> 00:07:35,546
Now I know these

103
00:07:35,576 --> 00:07:37,816
that this conference is

104
00:07:38,186 --> 00:07:39,566
but what I want to

105
00:07:39,566 --> 00:07:42,296
into a wildlife conservation

106
00:07:42,436 --> 00:07:47,096
So let me tell you what's

107
00:07:47,856 --> 00:07:52,996
Seven years ago tiger numbers

108
00:07:53,536 --> 00:07:57,216
When we look back now we realize

109
00:07:57,216 --> 00:07:58,726
if tigers were going to survive.

110
00:07:59,256 --> 00:08:02,926
So we came up with the idea

111
00:07:59,256 --> 00:08:02,926
So we came up with the idea

112
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,596
on tiger conservation.

113
00:08:04,596 --> 00:08:07,466
That had never been done before

114
00:08:07,836 --> 00:08:10,126
and we wondered if anyone

115
00:08:10,536 --> 00:08:12,176
With all the pressing

116
00:08:12,176 --> 00:08:13,486
who would care about tigers.

117
00:08:14,646 --> 00:08:17,086
Well, we found an

118
00:08:17,516 --> 00:08:21,456
in President Vladimir Putin

119
00:08:21,456 --> 00:08:25,026
out has a soft spot for

120
00:08:25,766 --> 00:08:29,606
Well, we convinced him

121
00:08:29,956 --> 00:08:32,296
to a unique gathering

122
00:08:32,376 --> 00:08:36,116
Russia to chart a path

123
00:08:36,736 --> 00:08:42,285
We put forward an ambitious

124
00:08:42,285 --> 00:08:45,746
of tigers in the wild

125
00:08:46,576 --> 00:08:49,976
which is the next

126
00:08:51,266 --> 00:08:53,086
We knew what it would

127
00:08:53,156 --> 00:08:54,546
it's a pretty simple formula.

128
00:08:55,126 --> 00:08:58,206
They need healthy habitat,

129
00:08:59,026 --> 00:09:01,156
and they need to be

130
00:08:59,026 --> 00:09:01,156
and they need to be

131
00:09:03,256 --> 00:09:07,596
We also knew that the main

132
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:08,546
political will.

133
00:09:09,636 --> 00:09:14,076
Well fortunately, the leaders

134
00:09:14,076 --> 00:09:16,186
and these are the countries

135
00:09:16,186 --> 00:09:19,816
in the wild agreed

136
00:09:19,816 --> 00:09:23,046
to a bold new recovery

137
00:09:23,746 --> 00:09:28,646
This was the first of its kind

138
00:09:30,266 --> 00:09:34,146
We call this TX2, Doubling

139
00:09:34,606 --> 00:09:38,056
And this year marks the

140
00:09:39,266 --> 00:09:42,786
And guess what, governments

141
00:09:42,786 --> 00:09:44,426
to implement the recovery plan

142
00:09:45,796 --> 00:09:49,896
and tiger numbers are

143
00:09:50,526 --> 00:09:55,856
For example, tigers have been

144
00:09:56,496 --> 00:09:58,736
as breeding in the wild

145
00:10:00,606 --> 00:10:02,166
And tigers have been recorded

146
00:10:02,856 --> 00:10:04,906
in places they've

147
00:10:04,906 --> 00:10:08,906
or documented before, which

148
00:10:08,906 --> 00:10:11,536
and Myanmar, which is where

149
00:10:11,536 --> 00:10:14,000
and her cubs was

150
00:10:20,176 --> 00:10:25,296
For the first time in a century

151
00:10:25,296 --> 00:10:27,216
beginning to tick

152
00:10:28,496 --> 00:10:30,706
If we are successful

153
00:10:31,006 --> 00:10:34,176
of doubling tigers it

154
00:10:34,176 --> 00:10:37,506
of the greatest achievements

155
00:10:38,476 --> 00:10:41,266
And personally, I

156
00:10:41,826 --> 00:10:44,246
because I've seen this

157
00:10:44,946 --> 00:10:52,046
So 20 years ago, gosh that

158
00:10:52,046 --> 00:10:53,796
of you were born.

159
00:10:55,216 --> 00:10:56,736
Twenty years ago

160
00:10:57,106 --> 00:11:00,256
in India called Ranthambore,

161
00:10:57,106 --> 00:11:00,256
in India called Ranthambore,

162
00:11:01,036 --> 00:11:02,566
It was a bad time for tigers,

163
00:11:03,126 --> 00:11:07,286
poaching had hit many areas

164
00:11:07,286 --> 00:11:10,456
which was once a tiger

165
00:11:10,456 --> 00:11:12,666
about 10 tigers left

166
00:11:13,386 --> 00:11:15,706
The park was suffering

167
00:11:16,186 --> 00:11:18,476
poor enforcement,

168
00:11:18,476 --> 00:11:21,116
We saw almost no

169
00:11:21,116 --> 00:11:23,396
that place thinking well there's

170
00:11:23,466 --> 00:11:26,686
survive with all the pressing

171
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:29,506
with how can park

172
00:11:30,786 --> 00:11:35,226
Well this tiger named

173
00:11:35,226 --> 00:11:37,086
about the time I

174
00:11:38,266 --> 00:11:40,476
We didn't see her then,

175
00:11:40,476 --> 00:11:42,126
she did manage to survive.

176
00:11:43,336 --> 00:11:44,896
In fact, she went

177
00:11:44,896 --> 00:11:46,926
of Ranthambore's

178
00:11:47,896 --> 00:11:51,086
Well after I left Ranthambore

179
00:11:51,136 --> 00:11:52,636
in the park, but

180
00:11:53,576 --> 00:11:57,296
The Indian government started

181
00:11:57,296 --> 00:11:59,636
more park rangers,

182
00:12:00,296 --> 00:12:02,036
and things started

183
00:12:02,646 --> 00:12:05,736
And amazingly, tigers

184
00:12:06,686 --> 00:12:10,426
And Machali not only

185
00:12:10,426 --> 00:12:15,006
on to have 11 cubs with

186
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:17,346
one of them appropriately

187
00:12:17,346 --> 00:12:19,176
because he was the

188
00:12:20,426 --> 00:12:23,116
And then those cubs went

189
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:28,846
And so Machali's dynasty

190
00:12:29,076 --> 00:12:30,656
and many of them are

191
00:12:30,656 --> 00:12:36,046
Well I had the chance to go back

192
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:39,566
to Ranthambore just a few months

193
00:12:40,306 --> 00:12:42,556
and I witnessed an

194
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:44,226
The park was teeming with life

195
00:12:45,196 --> 00:12:48,676
and Ranthambore's tiger

196
00:12:49,346 --> 00:12:53,696
That's a number that actually

197
00:12:53,696 --> 00:12:58,406
of the park, so much so that the

198
00:12:58,456 --> 00:13:02,056

00:12:58,456 --> 00:13:02,056
some tigers and relocating them

202
00:13:07,466 --> 00:13:09,436
in recent tiger conservation

203
00:13:09,866 --> 00:13:13,196
So I believe we can double the

204
00:13:13,336 --> 00:13:14,316
if governments

205
00:13:14,316 --> 00:13:17,656
and conservationists help

206
00:13:18,686 --> 00:13:21,406
Perhaps the boldest idea

207
00:13:22,026 --> 00:13:25,876
in tiger conservation today is

208

00:23:25,276 --> 00:23:29,696
And videos like this help

380
00:23:29,696 --> 00:23:31,406
like turtles are

381
00:23:31,596 --> 00:23:34,376
which helps us understand

382
00:23:34,756 --> 00:23:36,926
They are also great tools

383
00:23:37,756 --> 00:23:40,986
This video has been viewed

384
00:23:40,986 --> 00:23:44,246
it's gone viral and it's been a

385
00:23:44,246 --> 00:23:51,386
helped connect people to

386
00:23:51,606 --> 00:23:55,186
And innovative uses of GPS

387
00:23:55,186 --> 00:23:59,196
to understand where wildlife

388
00:23:59,196 --> 00:24:00,716
and their seasonal migrations.

389
00:23:59,196 --> 00:24:00,716
and their seasonal migrations.

390
00:24:01,376 --> 00:24:06,526
One of our scientists made

391
00:24:07,276 --> 00:24:10,116
by putting special

392
00:24:10,116 --> 00:24:12,146
with the latest GPS

393
00:24:12,146 --> 00:24:16,716
of eight zebras he discovered

394
00:24:16,716 --> 00:24:19,486
of northern Namibia to

395
00:24:20,106 --> 00:24:21,876
about 200 miles south.

396
00:24:22,506 --> 00:24:26,306
And this turns out to be the

397
00:24:26,306 --> 00:24:29,396
migration in Africa and

398
00:24:29,396 --> 00:24:32,286
that as recently as just

399
00:24:32,526 --> 00:24:34,796
about the longest land

400
00:24:35,346 --> 00:24:37,336
and this technology

401
00:24:38,086 --> 00:24:41,906
So here's an animation of the

402
00:24:41,906 --> 00:24:43,336
of about six or seven months.

403
00:24:43,546 --> 00:24:47,276
Each colored dot represents

404
00:24:47,636 --> 00:24:49,286
They start in this

405
00:24:49,286 --> 00:24:53,306
and they start moving south

406
00:24:53,306 --> 00:24:55,406
You'll see the dark green

407
00:24:55,446 --> 00:24:56,186
season is coming.

408
00:24:56,186 --> 00:24:58,886
They move south pretty

409
00:24:58,886 --> 00:25:02,046
where it turns out they eat a

410
00:24:58,886 --> 00:25:02,046
where it turns out they eat a

411
00:25:02,046 --> 00:25:02,696
wet season.

412
00:25:03,056 --> 00:25:07,366
They hang out there for about

413
00:25:07,366 --> 00:25:09,666
of start meandering

414
00:25:09,666 --> 00:25:11,976
to the place from

415
00:25:11,976 --> 00:25:14,596
It takes them a little

416
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:17,296
but they finally end up back

417
00:25:17,296 --> 00:25:20,226
to their preferred

418
00:25:20,506 --> 00:25:24,066
And the importance of this

419
00:25:24,066 --> 00:25:27,866
to advocate for protecting

420
00:25:28,406 --> 00:25:31,326
through its whole

421
00:25:31,686 --> 00:25:33,876
and thus preserve the

422
00:25:34,236 --> 00:25:35,286
in this particular area.

423
00:25:35,956 --> 00:25:38,926
Well, one of the most

424
00:25:39,336 --> 00:25:42,776
that I'm most excited

425
00:25:42,776 --> 00:25:46,736
of thermal imaging cameras to

426
00:25:47,486 --> 00:25:49,086
Thermal cameras are also known

427
00:25:49,086 --> 00:25:51,946
as infrared cameras

428
00:25:52,026 --> 00:25:53,856
from a person or an animal.

429
00:25:53,856 --> 00:25:56,366
And in a pilot we're undertaking

430
00:25:56,476 --> 00:26:00,406
in Africa we're pairing

431
00:25:56,476 --> 00:26:00,406
in Africa we're pairing

432
00:26:00,406 --> 00:26:03,826
that is able to distinguish

433
00:26:03,926 --> 00:26:07,386
So when a person crosses

434
00:26:07,386 --> 00:26:11,676
or inappropriately the software

435
00:26:11,746 --> 00:26:13,006
to enforcement authorities.

436
00:26:14,096 --> 00:26:17,086
Since these cameras were

437
00:26:17,086 --> 00:26:20,886
they're put on poles actually

438
00:26:20,886 --> 00:26:24,236
of 2 miles, up to 2

439
00:26:24,636 --> 00:26:28,436
And since they were installed

440
00:26:28,476 --> 00:26:30,586
intruders in this

441
00:26:30,586 --> 00:26:33,316
and one suspected

442
00:26:33,316 --> 00:26:35,976
And let me show you the

443
00:26:36,026 --> 00:26:38,086
or suspected poacher

444
00:26:38,716 --> 00:26:40,796
You see him walking

445
00:26:40,796 --> 00:26:42,446
which is the border of the park.

446
00:26:43,676 --> 00:26:47,716
He's looking for a way to get

447
00:26:48,816 --> 00:26:54,046
Finally finds a way, jumps

448
00:26:54,476 --> 00:26:57,916
And that red box around him

449
00:26:57,916 --> 00:26:58,736
the alert that's sent

450
00:26:58,736 --> 00:27:01,196
to enforcement authorities

451
00:26:58,736 --> 00:27:01,196
to enforcement authorities

452
00:27:02,076 --> 00:27:05,136
So if this technology

453
00:27:05,136 --> 00:27:08,446
if this pilot works we hope

454
00:27:08,446 --> 00:27:10,716
where we think it could

455
00:27:10,716 --> 00:27:13,916
in perimeter security

456
00:27:15,856 --> 00:27:20,476
Well remember I said earlier we

457
00:27:20,526 --> 00:27:22,966
footprints as a way to track

458
00:27:23,186 --> 00:27:25,116
Well we're still

459
00:27:25,426 --> 00:27:28,216
but these days we're

460
00:27:29,096 --> 00:27:33,136
Through advances in DNA

461
00:27:33,136 --> 00:27:36,696
of information can be drawn

462
00:27:36,976 --> 00:27:40,386
in the snow, including

463
00:27:40,386 --> 00:27:44,026
and incredibly what it

464
00:27:44,556 --> 00:27:47,826
So as we're working

465
00:27:47,826 --> 00:27:52,026
to refine this technology

466
00:27:52,026 --> 00:27:53,416
But this has the potential

467
00:27:53,416 --> 00:27:56,016
to revolutionize

468
00:27:56,016 --> 00:27:58,916
in their natural habitats and

469
00:27:58,916 --> 00:28:01,966
it could be useful for species

470
00:27:58,916 --> 00:28:01,966
it could be useful for species

471
00:28:01,966 --> 00:28:05,096
in very extreme environments,

472
00:28:05,096 --> 00:28:07,266
to study and very

473
00:28:07,886 --> 00:28:12,446
So this is exciting as well.

474
00:28:13,286 --> 00:28:16,756
Well, we've been hearing

475
00:28:16,756 --> 00:28:21,066
in so many different ways

476
00:28:21,066 --> 00:28:22,236
of our work in conservation.

477
00:28:22,236 --> 00:28:24,716
There's been a lot of

478
00:28:25,416 --> 00:28:28,966
The challenge we have with

479
00:28:29,066 --> 00:28:33,446
to develop civilian level

480
00:28:33,446 --> 00:28:35,506
of the similar capabilities

481
00:28:35,506 --> 00:28:36,966
but at a fraction of the cost,

482
00:28:37,216 --> 00:28:38,836
otherwise they're just

483
00:28:38,836 --> 00:28:40,886
by park managers and

484
00:28:41,836 --> 00:28:44,116
So we're experimenting

485
00:28:44,326 --> 00:28:48,476
of downscaled systems of

486
00:28:48,476 --> 00:28:50,616
and for different needs.

487
00:28:50,616 --> 00:28:53,806
For example, we're using

488
00:28:53,806 --> 00:28:56,386
of prairie dogs here

489
00:28:57,366 --> 00:29:00,306
Prairie dogs happen to

490
00:28:57,366 --> 00:29:00,306
Prairie dogs happen to

491
00:29:00,396 --> 00:29:03,326
for the most endangered

492
00:29:03,526 --> 00:29:05,856
which is the black-footed

493
00:29:06,436 --> 00:29:11,256
So by knowing where prairie dogs

494
00:29:11,256 --> 00:29:12,746
or have the potential to live

495
00:29:12,826 --> 00:29:16,366
so we can thus help better

496
00:29:16,636 --> 00:29:17,286
for them.

497
00:29:18,696 --> 00:29:22,936
We're also using drones to

498
00:29:23,256 --> 00:29:24,896
and address poaching in Africa.

499
00:29:25,666 --> 00:29:29,446
Well the challenge

500
00:29:29,446 --> 00:29:33,696
that they are probably

501
00:29:33,696 --> 00:29:38,276
as reactionary tools or

502
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:42,036
when another sensor is set

503
00:29:42,626 --> 00:29:45,416
that the drones can

504
00:29:45,416 --> 00:29:47,966
where potential illegal

505
00:29:48,706 --> 00:29:52,036
In fact, drones because

506
00:29:52,696 --> 00:29:58,706
of the videos is not as broad

507
00:29:58,926 --> 00:30:01,816
We are now working to

508
00:29:58,926 --> 00:30:01,816
We are now working to

509
00:30:01,816 --> 00:30:03,966
so that more can be

510
00:30:04,046 --> 00:30:06,736
We're also trying to

511
00:30:06,736 --> 00:30:10,356
like with the thermal cameras

512
00:30:10,506 --> 00:30:14,596
from animals and thus, send

513
00:30:14,656 --> 00:30:16,986
So we're continuing to

514
00:30:16,986 --> 00:30:19,516
and they certainly have a

515
00:30:19,966 --> 00:30:21,796
if we can get the

516
00:30:24,616 --> 00:30:27,346
We're also continuing to think

517
00:30:27,346 --> 00:30:30,156
of our challenges and I wanted

518
00:30:30,156 --> 00:30:31,696
in their early stages

519
00:30:32,246 --> 00:30:37,036
These are wire snares, snares

520
00:30:37,106 --> 00:30:38,686
to wildlife everywhere.

521
00:30:38,686 --> 00:30:41,026
Literally millions and

522
00:30:41,026 --> 00:30:45,376
around the world and they

523
00:30:45,376 --> 00:30:46,646
for wildlife.

524
00:30:47,806 --> 00:30:50,316
They're easy, unfortunately

525
00:30:50,316 --> 00:30:54,396
and relatively easy to use

526
00:30:54,396 --> 00:30:57,616
to detect them better, so

527
00:30:58,226 --> 00:31:01,126
In fact, in one park in

528
00:30:58,226 --> 00:31:01,126
In fact, in one park in

529
00:31:01,126 --> 00:31:02,976
to give you a sense of

530
00:31:02,976 --> 00:31:07,486
Malawi is a country in Africa,

531
00:31:07,486 --> 00:31:10,196
over an eight month period

532
00:31:10,196 --> 00:31:11,586
that were in this

533
00:31:11,966 --> 00:31:14,506
So what we're doing is we're

534
00:31:14,506 --> 00:31:18,026
of radar to try to map where

535
00:31:18,026 --> 00:31:19,576
of metal we can use

536
00:31:19,896 --> 00:31:21,786
Potentially positioned

537
00:31:22,146 --> 00:31:24,986
so that rangers can

538
00:31:24,986 --> 00:31:26,056
and go out and collect them.

539
00:31:26,346 --> 00:31:27,296
And if we can do this

540
00:31:27,296 --> 00:31:31,346
in a cost-effective way it could

541
00:31:32,366 --> 00:31:36,226
Snares typically grab

542
00:31:36,446 --> 00:31:38,156
and inflict a lot of injury.

543
00:31:38,156 --> 00:31:41,626
Sometimes it'll grab them

544
00:31:41,956 --> 00:31:44,326
fortunately the zebra

545
00:31:45,256 --> 00:31:48,286
but often species do not.

546
00:31:49,056 --> 00:31:54,296
We're also working on a gunshot

547
00:31:54,336 --> 00:31:56,166
where poaching is happening.

548
00:31:57,116 --> 00:32:00,116
And we got the idea from

549
00:31:57,116 --> 00:32:00,116
And we got the idea from

550
00:32:00,626 --> 00:32:03,256
which we actually read about

551
00:32:03,746 --> 00:32:07,636
ShotSpotter is used by police

552
00:32:07,636 --> 00:32:11,916
where gunshots are happening

553
00:32:11,916 --> 00:32:13,216
that are placed on buildings.

554
00:32:14,146 --> 00:32:17,106
We called up the Washington DC

555
00:32:17,106 --> 00:32:19,446
down to see ShotSpotter

556
00:32:20,256 --> 00:32:23,666
We sat in the command center

557
00:32:24,226 --> 00:32:26,736
as pins dropped in real time

558
00:32:27,416 --> 00:32:29,216
as shots were going

559
00:32:29,286 --> 00:32:31,366
It was quite a surreal

560
00:32:32,496 --> 00:32:35,466
The challenge we have on

561
00:32:35,546 --> 00:32:38,466
where do you put

562
00:32:38,466 --> 00:32:40,286
in a vast national park?

563
00:32:40,936 --> 00:32:43,236
No buildings there,

564
00:32:44,006 --> 00:32:47,826
Well the idea that we're working

565
00:32:47,826 --> 00:32:50,386
on a special collar

566
00:32:51,036 --> 00:32:54,336
that could help rangers

567
00:32:54,336 --> 00:32:55,726
where maybe an animal

568
00:32:55,726 --> 00:32:58,546
and if it's only wounded they

569
00:32:58,546 --> 00:33:00,726
of saving it than

570
00:32:58,546 --> 00:33:00,726
of saving it than

571
00:33:00,726 --> 00:33:05,646
and it could prevent

572
00:33:06,446 --> 00:33:08,496
Also it could be

573
00:33:08,496 --> 00:33:10,396
by simply seeing this device

574
00:33:10,706 --> 00:33:14,676
on the elephant poachers

575
00:33:15,816 --> 00:33:18,236
This could be a great

576
00:33:18,236 --> 00:33:20,986
but right now the costs

577
00:33:20,986 --> 00:33:21,956
limiting factor.

578
00:33:24,436 --> 00:33:28,746
Well none of this really

579
00:33:29,286 --> 00:33:31,276

580
00:33:31,276 --> 00:33:34,316

581
00:33:34,466 --> 00:33:37,756
who are really critical

582
00:33:37,756 --> 00:33:41,376

586

A lot of that success is due

587

big rates everywhere

595
00:34:20,835 --> 00:34:23,476
The reason for this

596
00:34:23,476 --> 00:34:25,755
of local communities, big

597
00:34:26,226 --> 00:34:29,606
but particularly communities

598
00:34:30,315 --> 00:34:34,235

599
00:34:34,295 --> 00:34:36,406
and help track poaching

600
00:34:36,406 --> 00:34:39,996
and illegal trading

601
00:34:40,056 --> 00:34:46,686
And in fact, one notorious rhino

602
00:34:46,686 --> 00:34:51,356
in Nepal after community

603
00:34:51,356 --> 00:34:54,346

604

00:44:34,686 --> 00:44:36,756
And as the technology

760
00:44:36,756 --> 00:44:38,426
of things develops

761
00:44:38,426 --> 00:44:40,656
to deploy it in conservation.

762
00:44:41,236 --> 00:44:46,626
And we need your help to

763
00:44:46,626 --> 00:44:49,206
to reach people everywhere

764
00:44:49,206 --> 00:44:53,000
about conservation to get

765
00:44:58,046 --> 00:45:01,506
Nature and all the wonderful

766
00:44:58,046 --> 00:45:01,506
Nature and all the wonderful

767
00:45:01,506 --> 00:45:08,256
of it is powerful and resilient

768
00:45:08,496 --> 00:45:09,506
if given half a chance.

769
00:45:10,996 --> 00:45:17,226
Technology can help do that,

770
00:45:17,326 --> 00:45:19,936
when we share ideas

771
00:45:21,356 --> 00:45:23,876
And we at WWF look

772
00:45:25,176 --> 00:45:25,566
Thank you.
