[ Applause ]

3
00:00:36,046 --> 00:00:39,476
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon and

4
00:00:39,876 --> 00:00:42,016
I'm Tyler Fox and

5
00:00:42,016 --> 00:00:43,546
by my colleague Peter Hajas.

6
00:00:43,936 --> 00:00:46,106
We're both engineers

7
00:00:46,366 --> 00:00:49,356
and we're really excited

8
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:51,166
how you can adopt 3D Touch

9
00:00:51,216 --> 00:00:54,096
to take your app's user

10
00:00:54,096 --> 00:00:58,366
We'd like to start

11
00:00:58,366 --> 00:01:00,116
of the fundamentals of 3D Touch

12
00:00:58,366 --> 00:01:00,116
of the fundamentals of 3D Touch

13
00:01:00,116 --> 00:01:02,896
and showing you how it

14
00:01:04,046 --> 00:01:08,156
From there, we'll talk about

15
00:01:08,926 --> 00:01:11,446
Home Screen Quick Actions

16
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:13,916
that you can add 3D

17
00:01:14,846 --> 00:01:17,266
They let users jump straight

18
00:01:17,616 --> 00:01:20,416
right to those key

19
00:01:21,936 --> 00:01:25,266
From there, we'll talk

20
00:01:25,876 --> 00:01:30,046
Peek and Pop are a seamless

21
00:01:30,186 --> 00:01:32,606
and navigate content

22
00:01:33,476 --> 00:01:36,626
We think that most apps will

23
00:01:36,626 --> 00:01:40,086
for adding support with Peek

24
00:01:41,236 --> 00:01:43,806
Finally, we're excited

25
00:01:43,806 --> 00:01:48,446
about UIPreviewInteraction,

26
00:01:48,626 --> 00:01:52,136
that allows you to make 3D

27
00:01:52,916 --> 00:01:55,646
It's for those of you

28
00:01:56,106 --> 00:01:57,666
of the 3D Touch interaction

29
00:01:57,946 --> 00:02:00,856
and it lets you use the

30
00:01:57,946 --> 00:02:00,856
and it lets you use the

31
00:02:01,136 --> 00:02:04,196
that we've honed for Peek

32
00:02:04,196 --> 00:02:06,066
in your own custom

33
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:08,476
It's really great and we can't

34
00:02:09,226 --> 00:02:14,466
So with that, let's get started,

35
00:02:16,296 --> 00:02:20,366
Devices that support 3D Touch

36
00:02:21,066 --> 00:02:22,656
that precisely measures

37
00:02:22,656 --> 00:02:24,476
of touches on the screen.

38
00:02:25,536 --> 00:02:29,166
Now iOS has always let users

39
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:30,266
on the user interface.

40
00:02:31,306 --> 00:02:32,666
This has been a hallmark

41
00:02:32,916 --> 00:02:34,726
since the original

42
00:02:35,356 --> 00:02:36,666
with its multi-touch display.

43
00:02:37,446 --> 00:02:41,496
But 3D Touch extends this

44
00:02:41,566 --> 00:02:45,276
to connect even more closely

45
00:02:45,826 --> 00:02:50,386
Let's take a look at some of

46
00:02:50,386 --> 00:02:53,636
up across the operating system,

47
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:56,256
When you press on an app icon,

48
00:02:56,806 --> 00:02:59,336
we reveal the Home

49
00:03:00,406 --> 00:03:03,616
As you can see here with Camera,

50
00:03:03,616 --> 00:03:06,046
into some of the key

51
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:07,496
that you come to perform.

52
00:03:08,076 --> 00:03:10,696
For example, taking a

53
00:03:11,106 --> 00:03:14,416
using the front facing camera,

54
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:15,626
with the rear facing camera,

55
00:03:16,046 --> 00:03:18,376
recording video or

56
00:03:19,646 --> 00:03:24,986
Now, new in iOS 10, if your app

57
00:03:24,986 --> 00:03:27,856
show right alongside the

58
00:03:28,146 --> 00:03:30,396
when the user 3D

59
00:03:30,986 --> 00:03:34,066
And something else to note

60
00:03:34,066 --> 00:03:35,436
on each of this app icons,

61
00:03:35,746 --> 00:03:38,826
the device is playing haptic

62
00:03:38,826 --> 00:03:40,126
when you've reached

63
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:42,416
where the quick actions

64
00:03:42,986 --> 00:03:47,996
Now let's move into

65
00:03:48,366 --> 00:03:50,746
at an example of Peek and Pop.

66
00:03:52,196 --> 00:03:55,126
Here in messages, you can

67
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:56,736
in a conversation with a friend.

68
00:03:57,656 --> 00:04:00,566
If I start to lightly apply

69
00:03:57,656 --> 00:04:00,566
If I start to lightly apply

70
00:04:01,066 --> 00:04:05,406
I can peek into it to

71
00:04:05,406 --> 00:04:06,196
of that content.

72
00:04:07,306 --> 00:04:10,866
Then if I continue to apply

73
00:04:10,866 --> 00:04:14,516
to that photo, which takes it

74
00:04:14,516 --> 00:04:16,656
with it, just like

75
00:04:16,966 --> 00:04:20,466
Peek and Pop is really

76
00:04:20,466 --> 00:04:23,646
to preview content and

77
00:04:24,066 --> 00:04:26,386
and release your touch

78
00:04:26,386 --> 00:04:30,056
to go tap the back

79
00:04:30,056 --> 00:04:31,746
Now, one thing to

80
00:04:31,746 --> 00:04:35,476
as we're crossing these two

81
00:04:35,476 --> 00:04:39,306
and Pop, the device, again,

82
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:42,636
to let you know when you've

83
00:04:43,096 --> 00:04:45,606
That's Peek and Pop.

84
00:04:46,496 --> 00:04:48,736
Let's take a look now at Mail,

85
00:04:48,796 --> 00:04:53,876
at some of the interesting

86
00:04:54,306 --> 00:04:57,056
I want you to notice

87
00:04:57,226 --> 00:05:00,106
and interruptible 3D Touch is.

88
00:04:57,226 --> 00:05:00,106
and interruptible 3D Touch is.

89
00:05:00,606 --> 00:05:02,636
As I modulate the

90
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:04,496
on the screen, as

91
00:05:05,196 --> 00:05:08,616
We're using blur and scale

92
00:05:08,616 --> 00:05:10,916
that you can continue to

93
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:12,786
And note how fluid

94
00:05:12,786 --> 00:05:14,976
and responsive the

95
00:05:15,476 --> 00:05:17,226
This is one of the

96
00:05:17,566 --> 00:05:20,976
that differentiates 3D

97
00:05:20,976 --> 00:05:22,596
and gesture based interactions.

98
00:05:23,796 --> 00:05:25,366
So you might be wondering,

99
00:05:26,266 --> 00:05:28,646
why should I support 3D

100
00:05:29,266 --> 00:05:32,596
Well one of the best

101
00:05:32,596 --> 00:05:36,426
that it can quickly accelerate

102
00:05:36,426 --> 00:05:37,906
that your app already provides.

103
00:05:38,526 --> 00:05:41,466
You saw a great example of this

104
00:05:41,876 --> 00:05:44,226
letting users go straight

105
00:05:44,226 --> 00:05:48,216
within your app just like deep

106
00:05:48,216 --> 00:05:50,056
into the action that

107
00:05:51,366 --> 00:05:54,526
But another really great

108
00:05:54,526 --> 00:05:58,436
that it makes possible, brand

109
00:05:58,436 --> 00:06:00,016
that were never before possible.

110
00:05:58,436 --> 00:06:00,016
that were never before possible.

111
00:06:00,886 --> 00:06:04,176
We're going to show you a

112
00:06:04,536 --> 00:06:07,896
when we go through this new

113
00:06:09,676 --> 00:06:14,366
Finally, we've adopted 3D Touch

114
00:06:14,986 --> 00:06:18,606
And so users expect all of your

115
00:06:23,016 --> 00:06:24,716
Let's go ahead and talk

116
00:06:24,716 --> 00:06:27,016
about how you can start

117
00:06:27,096 --> 00:06:28,656
with Home Screen Quick Actions.

118
00:06:28,986 --> 00:06:33,406
And to do this, I'd like to

119
00:06:34,426 --> 00:06:36,796
AppChat is a sample app

120
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:39,376
on to highlight some

121
00:06:39,376 --> 00:06:41,726
of 3D Touch in our application.

122
00:06:42,536 --> 00:06:45,276
Here you can see that 3D Touch,

123
00:06:45,406 --> 00:06:48,596
sorry AppChat is an [inaudible]

124
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:52,316
You can take a photo and send

125
00:06:53,036 --> 00:06:54,886
and here you can see

126
00:06:54,886 --> 00:06:56,426
of different chats

127
00:06:56,426 --> 00:07:00,836
I can tap on anyone of them, and

128
00:06:56,426 --> 00:07:00,836
I can tap on anyone of them, and

129
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:05,086
Just like that.

130
00:07:05,556 --> 00:07:08,476
AppChat is a very

131
00:07:09,296 --> 00:07:12,146
And we'll show you the different

132
00:07:12,146 --> 00:07:16,586
for 3D Touch to it, starting

133
00:07:17,276 --> 00:07:19,366
So when you press on

134
00:07:19,836 --> 00:07:22,056
we'll reveal some Home Screen

135
00:07:23,186 --> 00:07:25,406
You'll note, I can choose

136
00:07:25,406 --> 00:07:27,406
that will open the Camera

137
00:07:27,406 --> 00:07:29,456
and then choose one of

138
00:07:30,426 --> 00:07:32,296
But alternatively,

139
00:07:32,296 --> 00:07:36,306
of these bottom 3 quick

140
00:07:36,306 --> 00:07:38,766
that will let me send

141
00:07:38,766 --> 00:07:40,186
of my top three friends.

142
00:07:40,506 --> 00:07:43,006
The friends that I communicate

143
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:46,726
So there are actually

144
00:07:46,836 --> 00:07:48,166
of Home Screen Quick Actions.

145
00:07:48,646 --> 00:07:49,596
Let's talk about them now.

146
00:07:50,766 --> 00:07:56,246
The first type is Static Quick

147
00:07:56,246 --> 00:07:58,026
by your app at build time.

148
00:07:58,836 --> 00:08:00,606
And they're great

149
00:07:58,836 --> 00:08:00,606
And they're great

150
00:08:00,606 --> 00:08:02,356
that are always available

151
00:08:02,936 --> 00:08:07,486
For example with AppChat, we

152
00:08:07,796 --> 00:08:09,296
I can always create a new chat

153
00:08:09,296 --> 00:08:11,026
and then send it to

154
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:15,046
On the other hand, we have

155
00:08:17,036 --> 00:08:19,806
Dynamic Quick Actions are also

156
00:08:19,806 --> 00:08:21,866
to customize and

157
00:08:21,866 --> 00:08:22,686
that are shown to the user.

158
00:08:22,686 --> 00:08:26,106
But let's take a quick look

159
00:08:26,986 --> 00:08:30,966
Static Quick Actions are defined

160
00:08:32,756 --> 00:08:34,645
As such they're available

161
00:08:34,645 --> 00:08:37,566
as your app has been

162
00:08:38,775 --> 00:08:40,366
Now let's take a

163
00:08:40,366 --> 00:08:43,135
of how we add a Static

164
00:08:44,066 --> 00:08:47,426
Here's our info.plist file, you

165
00:08:47,426 --> 00:08:49,786
of code, that we

166
00:08:49,936 --> 00:08:51,776
and add this New

167
00:08:52,456 --> 00:08:53,846
I'd like to call out

168
00:08:53,846 --> 00:08:57,376
You'll notice we're specifying

169
00:08:57,376 --> 00:09:00,576
that your application

170
00:08:57,376 --> 00:09:00,576
that your application

171
00:09:00,576 --> 00:09:03,006
on when the user selects

172
00:09:03,396 --> 00:09:05,696
to know how to handle it.

173
00:09:05,856 --> 00:09:08,786
We also provide a title,

174
00:09:09,596 --> 00:09:14,356
And, also an icon type which

175
00:09:14,356 --> 00:09:16,836
of system provided icons

176
00:09:17,066 --> 00:09:19,556
So in this case that's how

177
00:09:20,156 --> 00:09:23,286
One thing to keep in

178
00:09:23,286 --> 00:09:25,506
to localize any user

179
00:09:25,746 --> 00:09:29,026
in your info plist.strings

180
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:32,926
That's Static Quick

181
00:09:32,926 --> 00:09:35,526
at Dynamic Quick Actions

182
00:09:36,766 --> 00:09:40,476
So these are defined by your

183
00:09:40,776 --> 00:09:43,366
from your app to the

184
00:09:44,036 --> 00:09:47,696
As a result though, they're

185
00:09:47,696 --> 00:09:49,656
launched your app for

186
00:09:51,436 --> 00:09:53,896
Now, Dynamic Quick

187
00:09:53,956 --> 00:09:57,246
after any Static Quick

188
00:09:57,746 --> 00:09:59,496
You'll only get to

189
00:09:59,496 --> 00:10:01,746
of four quick actions

190
00:09:59,496 --> 00:10:01,746
of four quick actions

191
00:10:02,216 --> 00:10:04,206
So you'll want to

192
00:10:04,206 --> 00:10:08,746
for any Dynamic Quick Actions

193
00:10:10,046 --> 00:10:12,986
You can also include an

194
00:10:13,776 --> 00:10:17,156
a custom icon using a template

195
00:10:18,056 --> 00:10:21,906
Or you can even create an icon

196
00:10:22,126 --> 00:10:23,226
from the user's address book.

197
00:10:24,086 --> 00:10:26,536
This is what AppChat

198
00:10:26,536 --> 00:10:29,326
in those nice profile

199
00:10:29,326 --> 00:10:31,466
of those three Dynamic

200
00:10:31,616 --> 00:10:33,056
for the top three friends.

201
00:10:33,926 --> 00:10:35,346
Let's walk through

202
00:10:35,656 --> 00:10:38,076
to see how we can

203
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:43,236
Well for this example we'll

204
00:10:43,236 --> 00:10:45,446
that matches our

205
00:10:45,956 --> 00:10:50,876
The first thing we want to make

206
00:10:51,136 --> 00:10:53,026
from the user to

207
00:10:53,466 --> 00:10:56,266
Assuming we have that

208
00:10:56,976 --> 00:11:00,886
and actually query their

209
00:10:56,976 --> 00:11:00,886
and actually query their

210
00:11:01,136 --> 00:11:03,966
that matches this friend's

211
00:11:05,016 --> 00:11:09,706
If we get at least one match,

212
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:13,486
to our UIApplicationShortcutIcon

213
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:17,376
That will go ahead and create

214
00:11:17,376 --> 00:11:18,316
with this quick action.

215
00:11:19,006 --> 00:11:21,616
But of course we may not

216
00:11:22,016 --> 00:11:24,106
permission to access

217
00:11:24,766 --> 00:11:27,166
or we may not have found

218
00:11:27,506 --> 00:11:29,026
So we'll want to

219
00:11:29,256 --> 00:11:32,336
in this case we'll use

220
00:11:33,046 --> 00:11:34,766
to display as the icon.

221
00:11:35,706 --> 00:11:38,016
Now that we have

222
00:11:38,016 --> 00:11:40,256
and create our actual

223
00:11:40,846 --> 00:11:44,156
In this case we'll need to

224
00:11:44,156 --> 00:11:45,976
to how you saw with the

225
00:11:46,966 --> 00:11:49,796
As well as a subtitle,

226
00:11:49,906 --> 00:11:51,826
and then we'll pass all of these

227
00:11:51,826 --> 00:11:54,326
over to our [inaudible]

228
00:11:54,326 --> 00:11:57,766
initializer to create our

229
00:11:59,096 --> 00:12:03,236
From here, we can continue to do

230
00:11:59,096 --> 00:12:03,236
From here, we can continue to do

231
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:05,636
to create any additional

232
00:12:05,866 --> 00:12:08,296
And when we're done,

233
00:12:08,536 --> 00:12:11,146
in a nice array,

234
00:12:11,736 --> 00:12:14,436
to UIApplicationsShortcutItems

235
00:12:15,186 --> 00:12:16,176
This has the effect

236
00:12:16,176 --> 00:12:19,676
of registering these Dynamic

237
00:12:20,026 --> 00:12:21,746
so that they can display

238
00:12:23,006 --> 00:12:24,156
One thing to keep in mind is

239
00:12:24,156 --> 00:12:28,156
that this shortcutItems property

240
00:12:28,516 --> 00:12:31,266
only contains your app's

241
00:12:31,266 --> 00:12:32,516
or Dynamic Quick Actions.

242
00:12:32,896 --> 00:12:34,926
The Static Quick Actions

243
00:12:34,926 --> 00:12:37,676
in your info.plist and won't

244
00:12:38,956 --> 00:12:40,686
Let's take a look at how all

245
00:12:40,686 --> 00:12:42,626
of this comes together

246
00:12:43,806 --> 00:12:46,906
Fantastic, with just those few

247
00:12:46,906 --> 00:12:49,496
to create one Static

248
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:52,686
as well as three different

249
00:12:52,686 --> 00:12:54,796
One for each of our

250
00:12:56,086 --> 00:12:57,976
There's now one more thing

251
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:00,236
that's of course to

252
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:00,236
that's of course to

253
00:13:00,236 --> 00:13:01,306
when the user selects one.

254
00:13:02,106 --> 00:13:04,866
There are two different

255
00:13:05,746 --> 00:13:08,856
The first one is if your

256
00:13:08,856 --> 00:13:11,366
and is being activated,

257
00:13:11,366 --> 00:13:13,456
in the inactive or

258
00:13:14,796 --> 00:13:17,366
In this case we'll

259
00:13:17,366 --> 00:13:18,796
on UIApplicationDelegate,

260
00:13:18,796 --> 00:13:21,736
application

261
00:13:21,796 --> 00:13:22,776
completionHandler.

262
00:13:24,276 --> 00:13:27,036
In here, we'll use the

263
00:13:27,036 --> 00:13:29,356
in to actually handle

264
00:13:29,756 --> 00:13:32,016
Now this could mean many

265
00:13:32,016 --> 00:13:33,356
and which quick action you have,

266
00:13:33,706 --> 00:13:36,356
but generally you're

267
00:13:36,406 --> 00:13:38,556
to a particular screen

268
00:13:40,096 --> 00:13:43,516
If you handle the quick

269
00:13:43,516 --> 00:13:46,286
to call the completion

270
00:13:46,286 --> 00:13:50,296
that indicates whether or

271
00:13:50,486 --> 00:13:51,726
Great, that's the

272
00:13:52,366 --> 00:13:54,716
The second scenario

273
00:13:54,716 --> 00:13:58,306
if the app was actually launched

274
00:13:58,656 --> 00:14:00,806
So in this case our

275
00:13:58,656 --> 00:14:00,806
So in this case our

276
00:14:01,976 --> 00:14:04,926
Here we'll use the

277
00:14:04,926 --> 00:14:07,346
didFinishLaunchingWithOptions

278
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,226
on UIApplicationDelegate.

279
00:14:09,876 --> 00:14:13,506
Inside, we'll access

280
00:14:13,866 --> 00:14:16,906
of the launchOptions dictionary

281
00:14:16,906 --> 00:14:19,056
if our app was launched

282
00:14:20,056 --> 00:14:23,466
If it was, we'll go ahead

283
00:14:23,716 --> 00:14:25,036
just as we would

284
00:14:25,566 --> 00:14:29,176
And then we'll make sure to

285
00:14:29,646 --> 00:14:32,696
that tells the system we did

286
00:14:33,066 --> 00:14:35,586
here, and it will prevent

287
00:14:35,586 --> 00:14:36,626
on the previous slide.

288
00:14:37,946 --> 00:14:41,446
That's pretty much all there is

289
00:14:41,806 --> 00:14:45,196
and handling both dynamic

290
00:14:45,196 --> 00:14:48,446
But let's review some of the

291
00:14:49,456 --> 00:14:52,966
First, every app should

292
00:14:53,306 --> 00:14:55,126
as you see here they're

293
00:14:55,126 --> 00:14:58,536
and they provide great

294
00:14:58,536 --> 00:15:00,456
on the Home screen,

295
00:14:58,536 --> 00:15:00,456
on the Home screen,

296
00:15:00,456 --> 00:15:02,706
to those key activities

297
00:15:04,596 --> 00:15:07,646
As such, you'll want to focus

298
00:15:07,756 --> 00:15:10,456
to the highest value tasks

299
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:13,176
Remember you only

300
00:15:13,566 --> 00:15:14,886
to display quick actions.

301
00:15:15,336 --> 00:15:17,676
So decide wisely

302
00:15:18,636 --> 00:15:21,456
To help you with

303
00:15:21,456 --> 00:15:24,636
to use Dynamic Quick

304
00:15:24,706 --> 00:15:26,756
to keep your quick

305
00:15:28,046 --> 00:15:30,716
Users are going to be quickly

306
00:15:30,716 --> 00:15:31,886
Actions and choosing one.

307
00:15:32,146 --> 00:15:34,466
And if you're doing things

308
00:15:34,936 --> 00:15:36,916
that'll probably

309
00:15:37,316 --> 00:15:39,626
and they'll find a

310
00:15:40,956 --> 00:15:44,256
One interesting thing to

311
00:15:44,776 --> 00:15:47,686
you should be prepared to

312
00:15:47,906 --> 00:15:50,166
from a previous version

313
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:52,646
The reason is, if you remember,

314
00:15:52,806 --> 00:15:56,466
Dynamic Quick Actions don't

315
00:15:56,466 --> 00:15:58,736
and has the ability to

316
00:15:59,486 --> 00:16:01,956
So if your app was

317
00:15:59,486 --> 00:16:01,956
So if your app was

318
00:16:01,956 --> 00:16:05,006
it will still be showing

319
00:16:05,186 --> 00:16:06,456
from the previous version.

320
00:16:07,446 --> 00:16:11,176
As a result, if the semantics of

321
00:16:11,546 --> 00:16:14,486
it's a good idea to keep

322
00:16:14,716 --> 00:16:16,346
and to do this you might want

323
00:16:16,346 --> 00:16:18,566
to consider including

324
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:22,396
in the info plist, I'm sorry,

325
00:16:22,396 --> 00:16:25,046
that you can include with

326
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:28,286
Finally, try not

327
00:16:28,286 --> 00:16:31,926
to add functionality that's only

328
00:16:32,096 --> 00:16:35,046
And remember, not all of

329
00:16:35,216 --> 00:16:37,726
and even on ones that

330
00:16:37,726 --> 00:16:38,936
to disable 3D Touch

331
00:16:38,976 --> 00:16:41,156
in the accessibility

332
00:16:42,336 --> 00:16:46,036
With that, I'd like to invite

333
00:16:46,036 --> 00:16:48,236
about Peek and Pop, Peter.

334
00:16:49,516 --> 00:16:52,676
[ Applause ]

335
00:16:53,176 --> 00:16:55,066
Go for it.

336
00:16:55,066 --> 00:16:55,856
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Tyler.

337
00:16:57,036 --> 00:17:01,396
I'm really excited to talk to

338
00:16:57,036 --> 00:17:01,396
I'm really excited to talk to

339
00:17:02,746 --> 00:17:07,736
As Tyler showed you earlier,

340
00:17:07,965 --> 00:17:12,226
to quickly preview and navigate

341
00:17:12,346 --> 00:17:15,046
And I can speak from

342
00:17:15,165 --> 00:17:17,665
that it changes the

343
00:17:18,776 --> 00:17:23,276
We're going to talk through

344
00:17:23,356 --> 00:17:26,965
that Tyler showed

345
00:17:27,616 --> 00:17:30,906
As Tyler showed you,

346
00:17:31,556 --> 00:17:34,116
AppChat is a standard UIKit app.

347
00:17:34,986 --> 00:17:37,736
So tapping on one of the

348
00:17:38,976 --> 00:17:42,946
brings me to the message so I

349
00:17:44,066 --> 00:17:47,346
A general rule of thumb

350
00:17:47,346 --> 00:17:52,546
to your app is that if user

351
00:17:52,866 --> 00:17:57,816
to navigate to it, it should

352
00:17:58,316 --> 00:18:00,806
So let's apply that

353
00:17:58,316 --> 00:18:00,806
So let's apply that

354
00:18:01,976 --> 00:18:05,926
That means that when I apply

355
00:18:05,926 --> 00:18:09,846
in this table, we

356
00:18:10,966 --> 00:18:14,676
In our API, we refer

357
00:18:14,906 --> 00:18:17,556
because we're getting a

358
00:18:17,556 --> 00:18:18,926
that we could navigate to.

359
00:18:19,946 --> 00:18:21,996
Now if we continue

360
00:18:23,336 --> 00:18:27,616
that'll Pop full screen,

361
00:18:28,496 --> 00:18:33,766
In our API, we refer to this as

362
00:18:34,056 --> 00:18:36,046
to navigating to

363
00:18:37,396 --> 00:18:39,936
Cool, so let's go

364
00:18:40,126 --> 00:18:41,816
of a Peek and Pop interaction.

365
00:18:43,336 --> 00:18:46,976
First and foremost, we have

366
00:18:48,036 --> 00:18:49,236
this is the View Controller

367
00:18:49,236 --> 00:18:51,776
that contains the user

368
00:18:52,096 --> 00:18:53,556
that we'd like to preview.

369
00:18:54,296 --> 00:18:57,636
In our case, these are

370
00:18:59,056 --> 00:19:03,476
Each registered View Controller

371
00:18:59,056 --> 00:19:03,476
Each registered View Controller

372
00:19:04,256 --> 00:19:06,736
these are individual

373
00:19:06,876 --> 00:19:09,506
that each have their own

374
00:19:10,356 --> 00:19:15,156
In AppChat, this is a natural

375
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:20,066
Finally, we have the

376
00:19:21,486 --> 00:19:24,956
this is the View Controller that

377
00:19:25,356 --> 00:19:28,446
which represents the element

378
00:19:29,506 --> 00:19:32,366
Usually this is the same

379
00:19:32,496 --> 00:19:34,026
after tapping on that content.

380
00:19:34,616 --> 00:19:38,606
So tapping on it, and previewing

381
00:19:39,316 --> 00:19:40,706
shows us the same content.

382
00:19:41,896 --> 00:19:46,026
So with that, I'd like to

383
00:19:46,026 --> 00:19:48,506
how we adding Peek

384
00:19:48,936 --> 00:19:51,166
which will closely

385
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:52,926
and Pop to your app.

386
00:20:03,056 --> 00:20:06,226
So we're going to start off in

387
00:20:06,646 --> 00:20:09,206
Remember this is that

388
00:20:09,376 --> 00:20:12,086
which contains our

389
00:20:12,606 --> 00:20:15,176
We're going to conform

390
00:20:15,576 --> 00:20:18,046
to the

391
00:20:18,046 --> 00:20:19,756
Delegate protocol.

392
00:20:20,556 --> 00:20:22,296
This delegate will

393
00:20:22,296 --> 00:20:26,126
at various stages during

394
00:20:26,506 --> 00:20:28,696
to provide information

395
00:20:29,556 --> 00:20:31,226
It's really easy to implement.

396
00:20:32,646 --> 00:20:35,986
Next, we'll want to make sure

397
00:20:36,746 --> 00:20:40,286
A great time to do

398
00:20:41,196 --> 00:20:43,156
We're going to

399
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:45,236
with ourself as the delegate,

400
00:20:45,886 --> 00:20:48,286
passing our tableView

401
00:20:48,986 --> 00:20:51,726
Because the tableView

402
00:20:51,956 --> 00:20:57,506
for all the interfaced elements

403
00:20:57,586 --> 00:21:01,936
Now let's go ahead and implement

404
00:20:57,586 --> 00:21:01,936
Now let's go ahead and implement

405
00:21:01,936 --> 00:21:04,606
methods in the previewing

406
00:21:05,436 --> 00:21:13,136
The first is for providing

407
00:21:14,496 --> 00:21:16,256
This will provide

408
00:21:16,476 --> 00:21:20,336
for a particular location

409
00:21:22,796 --> 00:21:25,286
The method is called

410
00:21:25,546 --> 00:21:29,416
ViewControllerForLocation,

411
00:21:30,946 --> 00:21:34,266
First, we're going to find the

412
00:21:34,266 --> 00:21:36,866
that we were passed in

413
00:21:37,856 --> 00:21:40,466
We can do this by hit

414
00:21:42,556 --> 00:21:45,466
Next, we're going to

415
00:21:45,996 --> 00:21:49,826
with the model object

416
00:21:50,876 --> 00:21:53,196
this is logic that you

417
00:21:53,196 --> 00:21:55,866
and did select row at indexPath.

418
00:21:57,176 --> 00:21:59,806
Next, and this is

419
00:22:00,226 --> 00:22:01,876
we're going to set

420
00:22:02,096 --> 00:22:03,566
of the previewingContext.

421
00:22:04,296 --> 00:22:07,706
Remember, the sourceView

422
00:22:08,256 --> 00:22:11,966
and we want to make sure to

423
00:22:11,966 --> 00:22:15,796
screen, in that beautiful

424
00:22:15,796 --> 00:22:16,756
that Tyler showed you.

425
00:22:17,616 --> 00:22:21,216
By setting the sourceRect the

426
00:22:21,216 --> 00:22:23,586
out that element and

427
00:22:23,806 --> 00:22:24,726
it looks really great.

428
00:22:26,096 --> 00:22:29,156
Finally, we'll return

429
00:22:29,156 --> 00:22:29,806
to the system.

430
00:22:31,126 --> 00:22:34,366
Now there are two

431
00:22:34,526 --> 00:22:37,376
about this delegate method that

432
00:22:37,936 --> 00:22:43,946
The first is that this method

433
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:46,226
think we're going to

434
00:22:47,306 --> 00:22:51,066
As Tyler said before, we want

435
00:22:51,066 --> 00:22:53,996
and fluid, so we're going

436
00:22:54,176 --> 00:22:55,726
to make sure everything's ready.

437
00:22:57,306 --> 00:23:01,346
As a result, you need to make

438
00:22:57,306 --> 00:23:01,346
As a result, you need to make

439
00:23:01,726 --> 00:23:04,156
when returning a

440
00:23:05,156 --> 00:23:07,476
If there's asynchronous

441
00:23:07,586 --> 00:23:10,896
in the background, before

442
00:23:11,346 --> 00:23:14,306
do that there, and don't

443
00:23:15,276 --> 00:23:18,716
This will keep things feeling

444
00:23:19,156 --> 00:23:20,506
as we apply pressure

445
00:23:20,876 --> 00:23:23,016
to interface elements

446
00:23:24,316 --> 00:23:27,196
The second important piece

447
00:23:27,396 --> 00:23:29,686
about this method,

448
00:23:30,526 --> 00:23:35,176
UIViewControllerOptional, that

449
00:23:35,926 --> 00:23:37,906
If you return nil

450
00:23:38,306 --> 00:23:40,616
we won't lift any

451
00:23:40,826 --> 00:23:43,716
we won't do any blurring, we

452
00:23:43,956 --> 00:23:45,336
we won't do a preview.

453
00:23:46,596 --> 00:23:48,936
But you should make

454
00:23:48,936 --> 00:23:52,246
if there truly is nothing

455
00:23:53,796 --> 00:23:56,286
You should make sure that

456
00:23:56,286 --> 00:23:59,136
in your app is previewable

457
00:23:59,876 --> 00:24:02,346
this way people won't be

458
00:23:59,876 --> 00:24:02,346
this way people won't be

459
00:24:02,346 --> 00:24:05,256
to get a preview, because

460
00:24:05,256 --> 00:24:06,746
previewable similarly.

461
00:24:07,856 --> 00:24:09,986
Great, so with that,

462
00:24:10,386 --> 00:24:14,396
we've implemented the preview

463
00:24:23,136 --> 00:24:24,126
But we're not done yet.

464
00:24:24,556 --> 00:24:27,096
We need to implement the

465
00:24:27,256 --> 00:24:30,516
on this protocol, which is

466
00:24:31,706 --> 00:24:33,726
This one's even easier

467
00:24:34,906 --> 00:24:38,246
it's called previewingContext

468
00:24:39,366 --> 00:24:42,166
This will be called by the

469
00:24:42,666 --> 00:24:44,356
we've crossed that

470
00:24:44,396 --> 00:24:46,126
we're going to place

471
00:24:46,636 --> 00:24:49,086
so let's get the

472
00:24:51,196 --> 00:24:54,746
Here, we're going to do whatever

473
00:24:54,746 --> 00:24:56,186
that ViewController on screen.

474
00:24:56,916 --> 00:25:00,926
AppChat is a simple UIKit app

475
00:24:56,916 --> 00:25:00,926
AppChat is a simple UIKit app

476
00:25:01,446 --> 00:25:03,956
so we're just going

477
00:25:05,016 --> 00:25:06,796
This will have the

478
00:25:06,966 --> 00:25:09,336
of pushing the ViewController

479
00:25:09,996 --> 00:25:12,166
But there's something really

480
00:25:13,116 --> 00:25:16,256
UIKit has made it so that

481
00:25:16,256 --> 00:25:20,476
of ViewController transition in

482
00:25:20,476 --> 00:25:23,676
onto the navigation stack,

483
00:25:24,116 --> 00:25:27,036
even move the ViewController

484
00:25:27,966 --> 00:25:31,386
Do whatever it is you need

485
00:25:31,386 --> 00:25:32,826
that ViewController on screen,

486
00:25:33,226 --> 00:25:36,036
and UIKit will handle the

487
00:25:37,116 --> 00:25:40,656
So great, we've implemented

488
00:25:41,416 --> 00:25:46,986
and now we've got that awesome

489
00:25:46,986 --> 00:25:48,506
to navigate full screen

490
00:25:48,676 --> 00:25:50,836
and begin interacting

491
00:25:52,636 --> 00:25:55,586
Now we've added Peek

492
00:25:56,026 --> 00:25:58,066
but we can do a little

493
00:25:58,206 --> 00:26:02,766
to take the experience,

494
00:25:58,206 --> 00:26:02,766
to take the experience,

495
00:26:05,636 --> 00:26:09,316
Another aspect of Peek and Pop

496
00:26:09,316 --> 00:26:10,156
quick actions.

497
00:26:10,686 --> 00:26:14,066
And by adding these to your

498
00:26:14,066 --> 00:26:16,416
to access the most

499
00:26:16,646 --> 00:26:18,646
with the content shown

500
00:26:19,416 --> 00:26:21,746
This is really powerful

501
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:24,406
to use your apps even

502
00:26:25,906 --> 00:26:28,706
If we go back to our

503
00:26:29,476 --> 00:26:32,336
we'll see that these preview

504
00:26:32,596 --> 00:26:34,306
by the previewed ViewController.

505
00:26:35,506 --> 00:26:38,086
This is the ViewController

506
00:26:38,086 --> 00:26:42,136
to these actions because these

507
00:26:42,136 --> 00:26:43,116
in that ViewController.

508
00:26:44,206 --> 00:26:45,426
These are easy to add.

509
00:26:46,326 --> 00:26:50,246
All we have to do is override

510
00:26:50,246 --> 00:26:52,136
function, in UIViewController.

511
00:26:53,146 --> 00:26:56,366
This returns an array

512
00:26:56,876 --> 00:27:02,886
We can create UIPreviewActions

513
00:26:56,876 --> 00:27:02,886
We can create UIPreviewActions

514
00:27:02,946 --> 00:27:04,076
probably familiar with.

515
00:27:04,806 --> 00:27:09,296
It resembles UIAlertAction

516
00:27:10,186 --> 00:27:15,796
You just pass a title, a style

517
00:27:15,796 --> 00:27:18,926
that closure when the action

518
00:27:20,426 --> 00:27:22,976
Next, we'll just

519
00:27:22,976 --> 00:27:25,846
of actions back to the system.

520
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:29,876
Now we've got one action here

521
00:27:30,296 --> 00:27:33,206
but AppChat lets you reply

522
00:27:33,766 --> 00:27:36,526
So what we really want to

523
00:27:36,936 --> 00:27:39,226
into one group action.

524
00:27:40,636 --> 00:27:44,836
We've got API for that too,

525
00:27:46,356 --> 00:27:50,536
All you have to do is create

526
00:27:51,366 --> 00:27:54,126
here we have them for all of

527
00:27:55,186 --> 00:27:59,776
And then create an action

528
00:28:00,126 --> 00:28:01,996
and the array of those actions.

529
00:28:02,166 --> 00:28:04,336
This is a great way for you

530
00:28:04,336 --> 00:28:08,256
to group related actions inside

531
00:28:09,776 --> 00:28:11,806
There are two other

532
00:28:11,806 --> 00:28:16,306
for the preview action

533
00:28:16,856 --> 00:28:22,496
And this is through

534
00:28:22,596 --> 00:28:23,706
on preview action item.

535
00:28:24,996 --> 00:28:27,396
The first is the selected style

536
00:28:27,666 --> 00:28:31,066
which will show a little

537
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:34,036
to let the user know that

538
00:28:34,036 --> 00:28:35,206
that option previously.

539
00:28:36,146 --> 00:28:38,256
Now before we came

540
00:28:38,336 --> 00:28:40,176
that check mark was

541
00:28:40,356 --> 00:28:42,956
so you'll be noticing that it's

542
00:28:43,236 --> 00:28:45,116
but rest assured that

543
00:28:46,776 --> 00:28:48,656
The other style that's

544
00:28:48,656 --> 00:28:52,766
to use is the destructive style,

545
00:28:52,766 --> 00:28:55,636
that an action may

546
00:28:56,326 --> 00:28:59,106
You'll see that here behind

547
00:28:59,526 --> 00:29:02,546
So by adding Peek and Pop,

548
00:28:59,526 --> 00:29:02,546
So by adding Peek and Pop,

549
00:29:02,786 --> 00:29:05,396
we've taken the experience

550
00:29:05,766 --> 00:29:08,536
to the next level and

551
00:29:08,626 --> 00:29:09,966
that your users can have.

552
00:29:10,876 --> 00:29:13,226
Let's review some best practices

553
00:29:13,366 --> 00:29:15,846
for adding Peek and

554
00:29:18,016 --> 00:29:21,426
First and foremost,

555
00:29:22,396 --> 00:29:26,256
content that can be tapped

556
00:29:26,446 --> 00:29:27,366
and Pop.

557
00:29:27,866 --> 00:29:30,156
You can look to Apple's

558
00:29:30,546 --> 00:29:34,326
for a great hint

559
00:29:34,446 --> 00:29:38,606
Next, make sure to return

560
00:29:38,716 --> 00:29:41,856
consistently from the

561
00:29:42,676 --> 00:29:46,266
Similar looking content in

562
00:29:46,266 --> 00:29:47,256
in a similar way.

563
00:29:47,876 --> 00:29:53,396
In that same previewing

564
00:29:53,396 --> 00:29:54,256
to take too long.

565
00:29:54,956 --> 00:29:57,816
Remember, we don't want

566
00:29:58,026 --> 00:30:01,596
because we want this interaction

567
00:29:58,026 --> 00:30:01,596
because we want this interaction

568
00:30:03,616 --> 00:30:07,326
Make sure to set the sourceRect

569
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:11,036
to lift the appropriate user

570
00:30:12,336 --> 00:30:14,776
So, that's it for Peek and Pop.

571
00:30:15,736 --> 00:30:17,736
Now I'd like to turn

572
00:30:18,076 --> 00:30:21,326
to some super cool

573
00:30:22,366 --> 00:30:23,836
UIPreviewInteraction.

574
00:30:24,776 --> 00:30:29,206
UIPreviewInteraction lets you

575
00:30:29,746 --> 00:30:32,616
which is force processing

576
00:30:33,306 --> 00:30:35,626
but bring your own

577
00:30:36,096 --> 00:30:40,166
And as we'll see in a moment,

578
00:30:40,666 --> 00:30:41,946
Let's look at an example.

579
00:30:42,516 --> 00:30:46,406
In AppChat, in our

580
00:30:46,856 --> 00:30:49,866
we've got this handy Reply

581
00:30:49,866 --> 00:30:54,216
On a non-3D Touch

582
00:30:54,536 --> 00:30:58,356
we can tap on that Reply

583
00:30:58,356 --> 00:30:59,926
of the emoji we can reply with.

584
00:31:01,196 --> 00:31:03,426
And then we can tap

585
00:31:04,546 --> 00:31:05,946
to send it back to our friend.

586
00:31:09,176 --> 00:31:11,776
But on a 3D Touch

587
00:31:12,376 --> 00:31:15,006
we can make this

588
00:31:15,006 --> 00:31:16,106
and a lot more fun.

589
00:31:17,576 --> 00:31:20,666
With just a few lines of code

590
00:31:21,786 --> 00:31:23,866
we added something really neat.

591
00:31:24,896 --> 00:31:27,806
We can apply pressure

592
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:30,616
and interactively

593
00:31:30,956 --> 00:31:33,236
notice how the blur

594
00:31:34,256 --> 00:31:37,896
Then while keeping my

595
00:31:38,116 --> 00:31:42,436
I can slide around to pick

596
00:31:43,466 --> 00:31:44,636
Hopefully we don't

597
00:31:44,706 --> 00:31:47,656
And then we'll send

598
00:31:48,976 --> 00:31:52,426
This type of one touch

599
00:31:52,426 --> 00:31:54,456
that 3D Touch is perfect for.

600
00:31:56,106 --> 00:31:58,756
Another thing that

601
00:31:58,756 --> 00:32:01,106
with is accelerating actions

602
00:31:58,756 --> 00:32:01,106
with is accelerating actions

603
00:32:01,966 --> 00:32:04,266
that can live closer

604
00:32:05,346 --> 00:32:09,216
In iOS 7, we added

605
00:32:09,376 --> 00:32:11,416
as an alternative

606
00:32:12,366 --> 00:32:15,126
And this is more convenient

607
00:32:15,126 --> 00:32:17,486
to where your finger is, you can

608
00:32:17,486 --> 00:32:19,886
of the screen and slide back.

609
00:32:20,496 --> 00:32:23,546
And by using 3D Touch, we

610
00:32:23,716 --> 00:32:25,156
to your app's interactions.

611
00:32:26,226 --> 00:32:29,346
So we can actually 3D Touch

612
00:32:30,146 --> 00:32:32,636
to interactively bring

613
00:32:33,156 --> 00:32:37,376
and then we can actually

614
00:32:37,966 --> 00:32:39,346
by applying some more force,

615
00:32:39,896 --> 00:32:42,606
and then pick an

616
00:32:44,116 --> 00:32:46,596
This type of rich interaction

617
00:32:47,296 --> 00:32:50,996
that can make things feel a lot

618
00:32:51,506 --> 00:32:54,226
is exactly the type of thing

619
00:32:54,406 --> 00:32:55,846
with UIPreviewInteraction.

620
00:33:04,746 --> 00:33:08,616
UIPreviewInteraction

621
00:33:08,616 --> 00:33:11,436
and Pop force processing

622
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:13,706
for the system provided

623
00:33:15,086 --> 00:33:18,886
and the automatic haptic

624
00:33:18,886 --> 00:33:22,646
through the stages of the

625
00:33:22,736 --> 00:33:24,206
to bring the user interface.

626
00:33:24,756 --> 00:33:27,536
And what's really

627
00:33:27,536 --> 00:33:31,526
that people can now build

628
00:33:32,156 --> 00:33:34,216
and apply that same

629
00:33:34,616 --> 00:33:37,256
in the system standard

630
00:33:37,876 --> 00:33:41,176
but also in the custom

631
00:33:41,406 --> 00:33:42,936
with UIPreviewInteraction.

632
00:33:43,796 --> 00:33:47,106
And that muscle memory will

633
00:33:47,756 --> 00:33:49,076
this is really cool.

634
00:33:50,226 --> 00:33:51,946
So let's walk through step

635
00:33:52,236 --> 00:33:57,986
by step how you might add

636
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:01,776
We're going to start

637
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:01,776
We're going to start

638
00:34:02,106 --> 00:34:04,586
to the

639
00:34:04,656 --> 00:34:05,536
protocol.

640
00:34:06,326 --> 00:34:07,916
This delegate will be informed

641
00:34:07,996 --> 00:34:10,976
at various stages during

642
00:34:11,266 --> 00:34:12,626
to let you know what's going on.

643
00:34:13,835 --> 00:34:17,216
Next, we'll want to make sure to

644
00:34:18,606 --> 00:34:21,146
Again, viewDidLoad is a

645
00:34:21,985 --> 00:34:25,676
Here, we'll create our preview

646
00:34:26,505 --> 00:34:28,525
and set ourselves

647
00:34:30,176 --> 00:34:34,496
Now, preview interaction is

648
00:34:35,005 --> 00:34:37,585
so let's talk through how

649
00:34:37,585 --> 00:34:40,686
When the interaction starts,

650
00:34:41,146 --> 00:34:44,706
if your delegate implements the

651
00:34:44,946 --> 00:34:51,085
should begin callback, we'll

652
00:34:51,516 --> 00:34:52,666
we'll begin the interaction.

653
00:34:53,856 --> 00:34:57,606
Now, as the force moves

654
00:34:57,606 --> 00:35:00,366
of the interaction

655
00:34:57,606 --> 00:35:00,366
of the interaction

656
00:35:01,186 --> 00:35:04,576
we'll message back your delegate

657
00:35:04,976 --> 00:35:07,476
didUpdatePreviewTransition

658
00:35:08,676 --> 00:35:09,226
Check it out.

659
00:35:10,336 --> 00:35:12,726
These force progress

660
00:35:12,836 --> 00:35:15,506
as a normalized value

661
00:35:15,556 --> 00:35:17,086
And what's really important

662
00:35:17,086 --> 00:35:21,006
to highlight is this is not just

663
00:35:21,906 --> 00:35:24,206
Because it's using the

664
00:35:24,476 --> 00:35:28,976
for Peek and Pop, we're actually

665
00:35:28,976 --> 00:35:32,746
So this is not just some

666
00:35:34,336 --> 00:35:38,506
As we move between these two

667
00:35:38,506 --> 00:35:41,886
at every step along the way

668
00:35:42,156 --> 00:35:43,006
through the interaction.

669
00:35:43,986 --> 00:35:46,526
And once we reach the

670
00:35:47,606 --> 00:35:50,356
we'll hear about it because

671
00:35:51,236 --> 00:35:53,726
and will passed true

672
00:35:54,206 --> 00:35:57,736
And, the device will

673
00:35:57,986 --> 00:35:58,866
haptic feedback.

674
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:03,176
Let's go through a sample

675
00:36:04,876 --> 00:36:07,506
Again the method is

676
00:36:07,786 --> 00:36:10,276
didUpdatePreviewTransition

677
00:36:11,106 --> 00:36:14,086
And here we're just

678
00:36:14,086 --> 00:36:17,206
for the current progress

679
00:36:18,226 --> 00:36:22,066
Now notice, this is actually

680
00:36:22,066 --> 00:36:23,406
of UIKit technologies.

681
00:36:24,016 --> 00:36:27,456
We can use it to drive a

682
00:36:27,886 --> 00:36:29,916
a percent driven

683
00:36:30,216 --> 00:36:32,436
or even a UIKit dynamic system.

684
00:36:33,666 --> 00:36:37,226
These instantaneous updates

685
00:36:37,226 --> 00:36:38,706
with all these technologies.

686
00:36:40,036 --> 00:36:41,866
And if the interaction ends,

687
00:36:42,286 --> 00:36:45,866
we'll want to show our

688
00:36:46,546 --> 00:36:49,206
This is the first

689
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:50,846
on UIPreviewInteraction.

690
00:36:51,926 --> 00:36:55,116
The second is for

691
00:36:55,846 --> 00:36:59,006
it's called

692
00:37:00,196 --> 00:37:03,436
This will be called whenever

693
00:37:03,986 --> 00:37:06,986
or if the interaction should

694
00:37:07,286 --> 00:37:12,906
For example we got a phone call,

695
00:37:12,906 --> 00:37:16,356
to zero, and reset ourselves

696
00:37:17,336 --> 00:37:20,786
But notice that we're doing this

697
00:37:21,556 --> 00:37:24,666
we'll want to animate

698
00:37:24,926 --> 00:37:27,786
to avoid things flashing

699
00:37:28,336 --> 00:37:33,456
So that's how we can respond to

700
00:37:34,696 --> 00:37:38,076
But remember in AppChat,

701
00:37:38,296 --> 00:37:39,986
to the commit state transition

702
00:37:40,196 --> 00:37:42,406
for sticking our

703
00:37:42,936 --> 00:37:46,526
We can implement the

704
00:37:47,186 --> 00:37:50,286
previewInteraction

705
00:37:50,496 --> 00:37:53,766
:ended, to respond to our

706
00:37:55,476 --> 00:37:58,586
So, when we're between the

707
00:37:58,956 --> 00:38:00,216
and the preview state,

708
00:37:58,956 --> 00:38:00,216
and the preview state,

709
00:38:00,936 --> 00:38:03,996
we'll call back

710
00:38:05,166 --> 00:38:07,426
And once we reach the

711
00:38:08,266 --> 00:38:12,516
we'll pass a progress value of

712
00:38:13,006 --> 00:38:15,356
And we'll also play

713
00:38:16,536 --> 00:38:18,546
then we'll begin

714
00:38:18,836 --> 00:38:22,986
to didUpdateCommitTransition

715
00:38:23,286 --> 00:38:25,196
from preview to commit.

716
00:38:26,936 --> 00:38:28,556
This is the same sort

717
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:31,726
of progress update normalized

718
00:38:32,756 --> 00:38:35,826
And, once we reach the

719
00:38:36,526 --> 00:38:40,726
we'll pass a progress

720
00:38:40,876 --> 00:38:44,546
and we'll play another different

721
00:38:45,126 --> 00:38:50,216
Let's go through a way in which

722
00:38:50,336 --> 00:38:53,986
So in our implementation

723
00:38:54,536 --> 00:38:57,466
of previewInteraction

724
00:38:57,696 --> 00:39:01,956
:ended, here we're going to

725
00:38:57,696 --> 00:39:01,956
:ended, here we're going to

726
00:39:02,536 --> 00:39:04,906
Again, this works

727
00:39:05,156 --> 00:39:07,596
of UIKit animation

728
00:39:09,116 --> 00:39:11,196
And once the interaction ends,

729
00:39:11,786 --> 00:39:14,936
we'll just show our

730
00:39:16,116 --> 00:39:18,466
So that's it for

731
00:39:19,536 --> 00:39:23,106
Now if you're building

732
00:39:24,016 --> 00:39:27,356
there's some low level

733
00:39:29,196 --> 00:39:32,516
This API provides

734
00:39:32,676 --> 00:39:36,806
to the force values coming

735
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:39,296
through two properties

736
00:39:39,726 --> 00:39:42,516
force and maximumPossibleForce.

737
00:39:43,866 --> 00:39:46,716
These values will be

738
00:39:46,716 --> 00:39:50,306
that support 3D Touch,

739
00:39:50,306 --> 00:39:53,096
from an Apple Pencil that

740
00:39:54,216 --> 00:39:57,636
And we won't get into them

741
00:39:58,086 --> 00:39:59,636
I encourage you to

742
00:39:59,776 --> 00:40:02,756
for the leveraging

743
00:39:59,776 --> 00:40:02,756
for the leveraging

744
00:40:03,146 --> 00:40:06,976
It's a really great talk and

745
00:40:08,386 --> 00:40:09,176
So let's review.

746
00:40:09,926 --> 00:40:12,126
As Tyler showed you earlier,

747
00:40:12,696 --> 00:40:16,406
Home Screen Quick Actions allow

748
00:40:16,406 --> 00:40:17,966
into action with many

749
00:40:17,966 --> 00:40:20,326
of the common activities

750
00:40:21,156 --> 00:40:23,796
And most applications

751
00:40:23,956 --> 00:40:25,876
from adding Home

752
00:40:27,006 --> 00:40:32,326
Next, I showed you how Peek

753
00:40:32,486 --> 00:40:36,346
and quick interaction like never

754
00:40:36,346 --> 00:40:38,776
with your app in

755
00:40:38,896 --> 00:40:42,656
And we think that many

756
00:40:42,656 --> 00:40:43,856
from adding Peek and Pop.

757
00:40:45,436 --> 00:40:49,056
Finally, we looked at

758
00:40:49,926 --> 00:40:52,866
which allows you to explore

759
00:40:52,866 --> 00:40:56,576
that is 3D Touch, and

760
00:40:56,716 --> 00:40:59,046
into the next dimension

761
00:41:00,276 --> 00:41:05,686
Finally, it's important to note

762
00:41:05,686 --> 00:41:07,846
on their device to

763
00:41:08,356 --> 00:41:11,466
so we would highly encourage

764
00:41:12,616 --> 00:41:16,706
For more information and to

765
00:41:16,756 --> 00:41:18,746
that we showed you

766
00:41:18,996 --> 00:41:20,766
which uses all these

767
00:41:21,216 --> 00:41:23,136
check out the address behind me.

768
00:41:23,976 --> 00:41:26,096
There are a few related

769
00:41:26,556 --> 00:41:29,746
one on the new

770
00:41:30,156 --> 00:41:32,456
which works great with

771
00:41:33,076 --> 00:41:37,566
And another for leveraging the

772
00:41:37,566 --> 00:41:41,086
And that's it, thank you so

773
00:41:41,086 --> 00:41:42,326
of your conference, thank you.
