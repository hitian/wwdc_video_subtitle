00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:01,536
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon.

6
00:01:04,275 --> 00:01:06,786
Thank for the introduction

7
00:01:08,046 --> 00:01:09,876
My name is Haben Girma.

8
00:01:11,246 --> 00:01:14,166
I work as an accessibility

9
00:01:14,696 --> 00:01:17,606
teaching organizations

10
00:01:17,766 --> 00:01:20,626
with accessibility in mind.

11
00:01:20,626 --> 00:01:21,586
I'm deaf-blind.

12
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:25,626
Deaf-blindness encompasses

13
00:01:25,626 --> 00:01:26,606
of vision and hearing loss.

14
00:01:26,606 --> 00:01:32,126
I have a little bit of hearing,

15
00:01:32,126 --> 00:01:36,406
I see maybe about 1% of what

16
00:01:37,786 --> 00:01:41,936
By identifying as deaf-blind,

17
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:46,226
that I'm part of a community

18
00:01:46,226 --> 00:01:51,246
through touch is equal in

19
00:01:52,406 --> 00:01:55,616
through sight, sound,

20
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:59,876
Our world is incredibly diverse,

21
00:02:00,746 --> 00:02:04,276
that celebrate that

22
00:02:04,276 --> 00:02:07,056
that diversity, we all benefit.

23
00:02:07,056 --> 00:02:11,006
So I identify as

24
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:16,036
to design non-visual access

25
00:02:16,556 --> 00:02:20,766
to help maximize communication.

26
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:25,606
This is tricky for some people.

27
00:02:25,636 --> 00:02:28,366
One of my best friends,

28
00:02:28,866 --> 00:02:30,316
wasn't sure how to say hi.

29
00:02:31,486 --> 00:02:32,886
She was sitting next to me,

30
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:35,316
in one of our classes

31
00:02:35,816 --> 00:02:39,206
And she waved hi, but

32
00:02:39,956 --> 00:02:46,086
And she voice hi, and

33
00:02:46,086 --> 00:02:49,306
It was our first day of

34
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:53,826
and she wasn't thinking

35
00:02:53,826 --> 00:02:57,686
She was thinking about

36
00:02:57,686 --> 00:03:02,406
And after a while, during the

37
00:02:57,686 --> 00:03:02,406
And after a while, during the

38
00:03:02,406 --> 00:03:05,996
She did the most logical

39
00:03:05,996 --> 00:03:09,986
She went onto Facebook and sent

40
00:03:09,986 --> 00:03:12,996
I'm sitting right next to you.

41
00:03:13,566 --> 00:03:17,346
Technology has facilitated

42
00:03:17,696 --> 00:03:20,756
for a lot of people.

43
00:03:20,756 --> 00:03:24,406
And when apps are designed

44
00:03:24,806 --> 00:03:27,926
iMessages, mail, other

45
00:03:28,656 --> 00:03:32,496
people with disabilities like

46
00:03:32,536 --> 00:03:34,556
to connect and share

47
00:03:34,556 --> 00:03:39,786
I saw that Facebook message my

48
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:44,476
out to her and we were

49
00:03:44,476 --> 00:03:50,216
and I explained the various

50
00:03:50,716 --> 00:03:52,776
Technology facilitates

51
00:03:53,426 --> 00:03:57,066
when both parties are

52
00:03:57,066 --> 00:03:57,906
in practicing inclusion.

53
00:03:57,906 --> 00:04:01,196
I want to share a photo,

54
00:03:57,906 --> 00:04:01,196
I want to share a photo,

55
00:04:01,196 --> 00:04:04,316
of the communication

56
00:04:04,316 --> 00:04:09,376
In this photo I'm standing

57
00:04:09,376 --> 00:04:11,706
from a digital Braille display.

58
00:04:12,216 --> 00:04:17,826
Digital Braille, comes through

59
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:20,245
that pop up to form

60
00:04:20,245 --> 00:04:24,536
And I read these letters

61
00:04:24,756 --> 00:04:28,856
Braille is a tool,

62
00:04:29,646 --> 00:04:34,156
I primarily use English Braille,

63
00:04:34,156 --> 00:04:37,436
and I've seen Braille in

64
00:04:37,436 --> 00:04:41,096
I was once on a ferry

65
00:04:41,096 --> 00:04:47,556
and I remembered feeling a bit

66
00:04:47,556 --> 00:04:48,986
of the signs were

67
00:04:48,986 --> 00:04:55,416
So Braille is a tool and the

68
00:04:55,576 --> 00:04:57,996
that produces this

69
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:02,816
Also in the photo, President

70
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:02,816
Also in the photo, President

71
00:05:03,846 --> 00:05:06,006
and he's typing on an

72
00:05:06,006 --> 00:05:08,176
and what's being

73
00:05:08,176 --> 00:05:10,446
to the digital Braille display.

74
00:05:12,046 --> 00:05:14,046
I'm reading what's being typed

75
00:05:14,046 --> 00:05:19,166
and this is a communication

76
00:05:20,336 --> 00:05:23,686
Deaf individuals have been

77
00:05:23,686 --> 00:05:25,516
for hundreds of years.

78
00:05:27,236 --> 00:05:31,196
Communities around the world,

79
00:05:31,196 --> 00:05:33,796
In the United States,

80
00:05:34,126 --> 00:05:37,136
the dominant sign language

81
00:05:37,986 --> 00:05:40,836
Which is heavily influenced

82
00:05:40,986 --> 00:05:43,716
My brother is deaf-blind.

83
00:05:43,716 --> 00:05:50,476
And when he communicates with

84
00:05:50,476 --> 00:05:53,286
When he's signing I put

85
00:05:53,736 --> 00:05:57,196
and feel what he is signing.

86
00:05:57,366 --> 00:06:01,226
When he wants to listen to me,

87
00:05:57,366 --> 00:06:01,226
When he wants to listen to me,

88
00:06:01,226 --> 00:06:03,076
and feel what I'm signing.

89
00:06:04,596 --> 00:06:08,276
Tactile sign language is

90
00:06:08,536 --> 00:06:11,296
that has developed,

91
00:06:11,466 --> 00:06:15,406
by the deaf-blind community.

92
00:06:15,446 --> 00:06:19,706
Another form is print on palm,

93
00:06:20,336 --> 00:06:24,166
they could write in

94
00:06:24,856 --> 00:06:26,226
and other forms of characters.

95
00:06:27,446 --> 00:06:33,336
Humans are incredibly creative,

96
00:06:33,336 --> 00:06:38,146
of us to connect and engage

97
00:06:38,196 --> 00:06:40,446
Another form of communication

98
00:06:41,086 --> 00:06:46,296
And dance is expressed

99
00:06:46,296 --> 00:06:51,576
Some deaf individuals who are

100
00:06:51,576 --> 00:06:54,376
dancers and will

101
00:06:54,846 --> 00:06:56,456
by watching the other dancers.

102
00:06:57,106 --> 00:07:04,016
Other individuals will watch the

103
00:06:57,106 --> 00:07:04,016
Other individuals will watch the

104
00:07:04,356 --> 00:07:08,286
by watching the fingers and

105
00:07:09,806 --> 00:07:12,526
People are very creative

106
00:07:14,046 --> 00:07:17,256
For me, dance is all

107
00:07:18,476 --> 00:07:20,856
Salsa is like a kind

108
00:07:20,856 --> 00:07:25,736
and people communicate

109
00:07:25,876 --> 00:07:29,016
music, emotions,

110
00:07:29,126 --> 00:07:33,966
Some of the signals

111
00:07:33,966 --> 00:07:37,886
and the people I dance with

112
00:07:38,366 --> 00:07:42,386
and switch those visual

113
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:48,746
Through dance we celebrate

114
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:53,266
Communities that celebrate

115
00:07:53,266 --> 00:07:56,796
to be inclusive,

116
00:07:57,266 --> 00:08:00,386
to make sure everyone can

117
00:07:57,266 --> 00:08:00,386
to make sure everyone can

118
00:08:00,986 --> 00:08:05,566
So dance is one community

119
00:08:05,566 --> 00:08:06,966
that practices inclusion.

120
00:08:07,016 --> 00:08:10,506
When I join a community,

121
00:08:11,066 --> 00:08:13,416
the first question people

122
00:08:13,446 --> 00:08:14,696
you communicate?

123
00:08:15,946 --> 00:08:18,176
The second question

124
00:08:18,176 --> 00:08:19,926
have you heard of Helen Keller?

125
00:08:20,516 --> 00:08:23,736
[Laughter]

126
00:08:24,236 --> 00:08:27,116
Helen Keller was an

127
00:08:27,526 --> 00:08:33,076
she lived from 1880 to 1968.

128
00:08:33,076 --> 00:08:35,086
She advocated for

129
00:08:35,086 --> 00:08:37,336
disability's rights,

130
00:08:37,736 --> 00:08:43,025
She spent her whole life

131
00:08:43,025 --> 00:08:45,446
of Helen reduce her

132
00:08:46,016 --> 00:08:49,846
She succeeded despite

133
00:08:50,556 --> 00:08:53,166
Disability never

134
00:08:53,926 --> 00:08:56,986
disability is not something

135
00:08:58,076 --> 00:09:01,536
The barriers that exist

136
00:08:58,076 --> 00:09:01,536
The barriers that exist

137
00:09:02,606 --> 00:09:05,796
And it's up to every single

138
00:09:05,796 --> 00:09:07,116
to remove those barriers.

139
00:09:08,536 --> 00:09:12,066
Helen was successful because

140
00:09:12,066 --> 00:09:13,866
that chose to practice

141
00:09:15,106 --> 00:09:16,426
She went to Radcliffe College,

142
00:09:16,946 --> 00:09:19,316
and Radcliffe provided

143
00:09:20,076 --> 00:09:21,616
And made sure she

144
00:09:22,616 --> 00:09:25,036
They worked to ensure

145
00:09:25,586 --> 00:09:29,306
Not every community

146
00:09:30,626 --> 00:09:32,326
Harvard wouldn't admit Helen.

147
00:09:32,866 --> 00:09:37,266
Back then Harvard

148
00:09:37,686 --> 00:09:40,716
Helen's disability

149
00:09:41,756 --> 00:09:46,276
her gender didn't hold her back,

150
00:09:46,746 --> 00:09:48,976
that chose to deny

151
00:09:49,576 --> 00:09:54,666
As another example, Helen's

152
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:56,436
to experience marriage.

153
00:09:56,536 --> 00:10:01,126
Helen fell in love,

154
00:09:56,536 --> 00:10:01,126
Helen fell in love,

155
00:10:01,886 --> 00:10:05,626
but her family prevented her

156
00:10:05,626 --> 00:10:07,736
from marrying the

157
00:10:09,536 --> 00:10:12,396
Helen's disability didn't

158
00:10:12,856 --> 00:10:15,446
She wrote extensively

159
00:10:16,196 --> 00:10:18,996
But her family, her community,

160
00:10:19,886 --> 00:10:23,336
chose to create insurmountable

161
00:10:23,336 --> 00:10:27,666
All the barriers that exist

162
00:10:29,046 --> 00:10:33,466
Of members of society, we play a

163
00:10:33,746 --> 00:10:36,906
and making sure that everyone

164
00:10:36,976 --> 00:10:39,546
and has access to opportunities.

165
00:10:41,076 --> 00:10:42,756
We've come a long way

166
00:10:42,856 --> 00:10:47,706
More and more communities

167
00:10:47,706 --> 00:10:48,336
and relationships.

168
00:10:48,336 --> 00:10:52,336
Harvard eventually

169
00:10:52,336 --> 00:10:54,086
to open its doors to women.

170
00:10:55,456 --> 00:10:59,776
And now technology

171
00:10:59,776 --> 00:11:02,676
for people to connect.

172
00:10:59,776 --> 00:11:02,676
for people to connect.

173
00:11:02,676 --> 00:11:06,376
I often wonder, what would

174
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:11,296
what freedom would she have

175
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:14,186
to the world of apps

176
00:11:14,536 --> 00:11:15,816
to people with disabilities?

177
00:11:15,816 --> 00:11:21,376
One of the features

178
00:11:21,906 --> 00:11:24,296
for developers, is

179
00:11:24,296 --> 00:11:28,046
And VoiceOver is a

180
00:11:28,846 --> 00:11:32,606
when an app is compatible

181
00:11:32,606 --> 00:11:36,876
in speech or digital

182
00:11:36,876 --> 00:11:38,996
I'm going to share a

183
00:11:38,996 --> 00:11:40,546
that shows how VoiceOver works.

184
00:13:49,516 --> 00:13:57,616
[ Applause ]

185
00:13:58,116 --> 00:14:00,866
Apple has a variety of

186

Apple has a variety of

187
00:14:01,076 --> 00:14:04,806
VoiceOver is one

188
00:14:04,806 --> 00:14:07,786
Another one, support

189
00:14:08,726 --> 00:14:12,156
When you support Dynamic Type,

190
00:14:12,156 --> 00:14:17,306
and need larger font sizes can

191
00:14:17,306 --> 00:14:19,046
Another feature is Captioning.

192
00:14:19,806 --> 00:14:23,216
Support for Captioning allows

193
00:14:23,216 --> 00:14:26,586
of hearing, to access the

194
00:14:27,446 --> 00:14:32,066
Support for Assistive

195
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:37,706
switch controls, switch

196
00:14:37,706 --> 00:14:38,986
with limited mobility.

197
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:42,866
So these are some of the

198
00:14:43,106 --> 00:14:46,346
for your apps to be accessible,

199
00:14:46,346 --> 00:14:47,866
for people with disabilities.

200
00:14:49,366 --> 00:14:53,406
But don't stop there, keep

201
00:14:53,406 --> 00:14:56,136
of new ways for people to

202
00:14:57,406 --> 00:15:01,126
Our goal is to have a

203
00:14:57,406 --> 00:15:01,126
Our goal is to have a

204
00:15:01,426 --> 00:15:05,976
in the app store,

205
00:15:06,156 --> 00:15:09,126
Right now if I need an app,

206
00:15:09,126 --> 00:15:12,376
to shopping, I need

207
00:15:12,376 --> 00:15:14,066
for an accessible app.

208
00:15:14,566 --> 00:15:17,706
And sometimes, there isn't

209
00:15:18,236 --> 00:15:21,136
Our goal is to have every app

210
00:15:21,886 --> 00:15:24,976
and I mean every single

211
00:15:27,286 --> 00:15:31,306
Several years ago, I went

212
00:15:32,546 --> 00:15:34,956
and when I arrived in my hotel

213
00:15:34,956 --> 00:15:38,746
in Beijing I did what I always

214
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:42,856
I explored and while

215
00:15:43,536 --> 00:15:46,636
I discovered an unidentifiable

216
00:15:46,816 --> 00:15:50,396
It felt a little like

217
00:15:51,316 --> 00:15:53,456
but I've never seen

218
00:15:53,456 --> 00:15:57,976
I was wondering,

219
00:15:58,076 --> 00:16:00,076
[Laughter]

220
00:15:58,076 --> 00:16:00,076
[Laughter]

221
00:16:00,136 --> 00:16:03,566
I was super curious to

222
00:16:04,966 --> 00:16:07,936
but not curious enough to taste

223
00:16:10,376 --> 00:16:16,256
So instead I got out my camera,

224
00:16:16,256 --> 00:16:21,226
and texted it to a friend,

225
00:16:22,686 --> 00:16:23,826
Is it safe to eat?

226
00:16:23,826 --> 00:16:28,366
I learned that it

227
00:16:28,366 --> 00:16:33,956
And I discovered I

228
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:35,966
Now imagine a lot

229
00:16:36,436 --> 00:16:38,646
why would a camera app

230
00:16:38,646 --> 00:16:41,986
Why would blind people

231
00:16:43,206 --> 00:16:45,626
We take pictures for the

232
00:16:45,626 --> 00:16:46,476
take pictures.

233
00:16:47,196 --> 00:16:51,316
To capture moments, to share

234
00:16:52,606 --> 00:16:55,016
Our goal is to make sure

235
00:16:55,146 --> 00:16:58,866
Try not to make assumptions

236
00:16:58,866 --> 00:17:02,226
with disabilities

237
00:16:58,866 --> 00:17:02,226
with disabilities

238
00:17:02,426 --> 00:17:03,546
Instead, strive for inclusion.

239
00:17:03,546 --> 00:17:08,776
And after you strive for

240
00:17:08,776 --> 00:17:10,606
here are a few things

241
00:17:11,156 --> 00:17:15,896
It helps to plan for

242
00:17:15,896 --> 00:17:18,226
It's much easier, it

243
00:17:18,226 --> 00:17:22,616
If you plan for accessibility,

244
00:17:23,816 --> 00:17:26,846
I'll give an example

245
00:17:26,846 --> 00:17:28,676
Imagine someone builds

246
00:17:29,606 --> 00:17:33,836
but realizes they forgot to put

247
00:17:33,836 --> 00:17:37,046
of the building, and then

248
00:17:37,816 --> 00:17:40,566
That's more time consuming

249
00:17:40,596 --> 00:17:43,946
it would be much

250
00:17:43,946 --> 00:17:46,756
for an elevator from the start.

251
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:49,046
Same principle applies

252
00:17:49,956 --> 00:17:51,426
You save yourself resources

253
00:17:51,426 --> 00:17:53,906
when you can have accessibility

254
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,906
And there are engineers

255
00:17:56,906 --> 00:18:01,116
designers with disabilities,

256
00:17:56,906 --> 00:18:01,116
designers with disabilities,

257
00:18:01,536 --> 00:18:02,646
to help you with the process.

258
00:18:03,576 --> 00:18:06,966
There are all so many disability

259
00:18:06,966 --> 00:18:11,996
and around the world, to

260
00:18:13,076 --> 00:18:17,086
engage with us, from initial

261
00:18:18,506 --> 00:18:20,636
Apple also has a

262
00:18:20,706 --> 00:18:21,876
to help you with this process.

263
00:18:22,956 --> 00:18:25,816
Their online tutorials,

264
00:18:25,816 --> 00:18:27,586
accessibility guidelines

265
00:18:28,596 --> 00:18:32,676
Tomorrow evening here, at WWDC,

266
00:18:32,846 --> 00:18:36,926
we're going to have an

267
00:18:37,106 --> 00:18:38,486
and join us.

268
00:18:38,486 --> 00:18:41,416
I'll be there to

269
00:18:41,996 --> 00:18:43,806
lots of accessibility

270
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:46,596
including developers who've

271
00:18:46,596 --> 00:18:49,866
of making sure their

272
00:18:51,036 --> 00:18:55,376
So these are resources

273
00:18:55,376 --> 00:18:59,296
and will help you design

274
00:18:59,296 --> 00:19:00,746
Accessibility benefits

275
00:18:59,296 --> 00:19:00,746
Accessibility benefits

276
00:19:01,676 --> 00:19:03,326
but it also benefits you.

277
00:19:04,786 --> 00:19:08,756
Accessibility has many

278
00:19:09,546 --> 00:19:12,756
people with disabilities are

279
00:19:13,356 --> 00:19:16,536
About 1 in 5 Americans

280
00:19:17,346 --> 00:19:19,486
So when you design with

281
00:19:19,486 --> 00:19:21,526
you get access to

282
00:19:22,296 --> 00:19:24,336
more people can benefit

283
00:19:24,806 --> 00:19:30,586
Another thing to keep in mind is

284
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:33,336
for everyone including

285
00:19:33,336 --> 00:19:37,416
For example, when you

286
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:42,486
and you add alternative

287
00:19:43,526 --> 00:19:45,466
more text is associated

288
00:19:45,466 --> 00:19:53,406
And because of that, it's easier

289
00:19:53,976 --> 00:19:55,406
through powerful

290
00:19:55,706 --> 00:20:00,896
The videos from WWDC are

291
00:19:55,706 --> 00:20:00,896
The videos from WWDC are

292
00:20:00,896 --> 00:20:07,446
produce a transcript and

293
00:20:07,866 --> 00:20:12,746
and find exactly where in the

294
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:16,056
This is an example

295
00:20:16,056 --> 00:20:18,566
that benefits the

296
00:20:19,126 --> 00:20:21,506
also benefits the

297
00:20:22,066 --> 00:20:25,566
But the most important

298
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:29,496
Disability drives innovation.

299
00:20:29,496 --> 00:20:33,586
When you think about new ways

300
00:20:34,206 --> 00:20:40,516
new ways for people to connect,

301
00:20:40,516 --> 00:20:44,646
you're going to find yourself

302
00:20:44,646 --> 00:20:48,776
Throughout our history

303
00:20:49,126 --> 00:20:54,076
innovation, that benefits

304
00:20:54,076 --> 00:20:56,776
of the products we use today,

305
00:20:56,776 --> 00:21:01,166
can be traced back

306
00:20:56,776 --> 00:21:01,166
can be traced back

307
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:05,406
In 1808, an Italian inventor

308
00:21:05,406 --> 00:21:07,416
of the first working

309
00:21:08,396 --> 00:21:10,926
He wanted a solution

310
00:21:11,726 --> 00:21:13,636
that didn't require vision.

311
00:21:14,156 --> 00:21:18,036
That someone can do by touch.

312
00:21:18,036 --> 00:21:22,896
Now Turri had a lover who was

313
00:21:22,896 --> 00:21:26,206
to be able to write

314
00:21:26,486 --> 00:21:29,416
So he designed the first, one

315
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:31,526
as a possible solution.

316
00:21:32,466 --> 00:21:37,166
And now today, around the world,

317
00:21:37,556 --> 00:21:41,286
lots of people who use

318
00:21:41,746 --> 00:21:46,496
both sighted typists

319
00:21:46,826 --> 00:21:50,356
More recently, one of the

320
00:21:51,246 --> 00:21:53,896
Vinton Cerf, is hard of hearing,

321
00:21:54,706 --> 00:21:59,086
and his wife is also hearing

322
00:21:59,086 --> 00:22:02,636
for a solution that would

323
00:21:59,086 --> 00:22:02,636
for a solution that would

324
00:22:03,046 --> 00:22:06,486
without using hearing.

325
00:22:07,666 --> 00:22:12,796
And to communicate from afar.

326
00:22:12,886 --> 00:22:14,446
Disability drives innovation,

327
00:22:14,496 --> 00:22:17,316
not just by non-disabled

328
00:22:18,236 --> 00:22:20,596
with disabilities as well.

329
00:22:20,596 --> 00:22:23,926
Vinton ended up developing one

330
00:22:24,916 --> 00:22:27,756
and electronic mail

331
00:22:27,756 --> 00:22:30,066
to communicate from afar.

332
00:22:31,026 --> 00:22:34,216
And now, just about

333
00:22:35,106 --> 00:22:36,526
and sends text messages.

334
00:22:37,516 --> 00:22:42,066
Solutions designed with

335
00:22:42,066 --> 00:22:44,046
up benefiting the

336
00:22:44,646 --> 00:22:50,106
And central to innovation

337
00:22:50,696 --> 00:22:55,896
I'm going to share a

338
00:22:55,896 --> 00:23:00,636
And a jungle gym

339
00:22:55,896 --> 00:23:00,636
And a jungle gym

340
00:23:01,256 --> 00:23:04,736
There are multiple ways to get

341
00:23:04,736 --> 00:23:07,396
or wrong way to climb,

342
00:23:07,396 --> 00:23:10,576
or wrong path to take.

343
00:23:10,576 --> 00:23:13,476
When I'm climbing I

344
00:23:15,906 --> 00:23:18,876
This is about, 20 feet tall,

345
00:23:19,696 --> 00:23:23,156
it's a pyramid shaped

346
00:23:23,706 --> 00:23:29,936
And when I climb, I reach out,

347
00:23:29,936 --> 00:23:32,046
until I find the solution.

348
00:23:32,146 --> 00:23:37,796
There are many, many, many

349
00:23:37,796 --> 00:23:41,966
by touch, by sight, by sound.

350
00:23:41,966 --> 00:23:44,996
You could have someone

351
00:23:44,996 --> 00:23:45,666
voice guidance.

352
00:23:45,666 --> 00:23:48,566
If you have a mobility

353
00:23:49,026 --> 00:23:53,136
you can design an

354
00:23:53,266 --> 00:23:56,816
Exploration values

355
00:23:57,386 --> 00:23:59,916
and the more open you

356
00:24:00,236 --> 00:24:04,886
in multiple perspectives,

357
00:24:05,046 --> 00:24:08,686
to design, develop

358
00:24:09,126 --> 00:24:13,046
One area where we rarely

359
00:24:13,246 --> 00:24:16,386
And haptics is the concept

360
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:19,976
of communication

361
00:24:19,976 --> 00:24:22,686
I have an Apple Watch,

362
00:24:23,356 --> 00:24:26,166
and it taps my wrist twice

363
00:24:26,296 --> 00:24:28,596
And that's a form

364
00:24:28,596 --> 00:24:32,886
of communication based

365
00:24:34,276 --> 00:24:35,746
I recently went surfing,

366
00:24:35,846 --> 00:24:41,226
and that whole experience

367
00:24:41,426 --> 00:24:47,336
Here's a photo of

368
00:24:47,336 --> 00:24:49,556
and a tandem board

369
00:24:49,556 --> 00:24:52,206
I'm standing near the front

370
00:24:53,326 --> 00:24:55,966
and in the back is

371
00:24:55,966 --> 00:24:58,266
Matt Allen from Maui

372
00:24:58,266 --> 00:25:00,946
He was using tactile signals.

373
00:24:58,266 --> 00:25:00,946
He was using tactile signals.

374
00:25:00,986 --> 00:25:07,416
I could also feel the power

375
00:25:07,416 --> 00:25:08,226
through the surf board.

376
00:25:09,686 --> 00:25:13,336
The wind, the sun,

377
00:25:13,336 --> 00:25:17,646
Skin is our largest organ,

378
00:25:18,796 --> 00:25:22,736
yet we've barely explored

379
00:25:23,516 --> 00:25:26,976
There's a lot of potential

380
00:25:27,216 --> 00:25:29,646
of haptics and technology.

381
00:25:30,916 --> 00:25:36,076
Keep exploring, keep

382
00:25:36,596 --> 00:25:39,246
that are going to increase

383
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:41,386
