00:00:23,436 --> 00:00:25,026
&gt;&gt; Hi, good morning.

3
00:00:26,366 --> 00:00:26,676
Thanks.

Welcome to What's

6
00:00:34,206 --> 00:00:36,566
Signing your apps

7
00:00:36,816 --> 00:00:37,886
We understand this.

8
00:00:38,426 --> 00:00:40,016
And what you need to know is,

9
00:00:40,246 --> 00:00:44,816
in Xcode 8 we've made it really

10
00:00:45,496 --> 00:00:46,646
In fact, it's automatic.

11
00:00:47,316 --> 00:00:50,766
And on the other hand,

12
00:00:50,766 --> 00:00:53,206
over what Xcode does and

13
00:00:53,516 --> 00:00:55,466
you now have that as an option.

14
00:00:55,816 --> 00:00:59,146
And Xcode won't modify

15
00:01:00,516 --> 00:01:06,546
[ Applause ]

16
00:01:07,046 --> 00:01:09,606
Signing identifies you to users.

17
00:01:10,016 --> 00:01:13,546
And they know that when they

18
00:01:13,546 --> 00:01:16,896
and it hasn't been

19
00:01:17,076 --> 00:01:19,786
Signing also prevents

20
00:01:20,066 --> 00:01:23,426
When you register your bundle

21
00:01:23,886 --> 00:01:28,346
another developer team can't

22
00:01:28,536 --> 00:01:32,186
Signing also allows

23
00:01:32,186 --> 00:01:34,326
like iCloud internet payments.

24
00:01:34,836 --> 00:01:38,746
We're going to go over

25
00:01:39,756 --> 00:01:41,256
We're going to start

26
00:01:41,256 --> 00:01:43,156
about the fundamentals

27
00:01:44,386 --> 00:01:47,426
What do you need in

28
00:01:48,296 --> 00:01:51,766
After that, we'll talk

29
00:01:51,766 --> 00:01:55,326
that we've made involving

30
00:01:55,326 --> 00:01:56,576
with signing certificates.

31
00:01:57,046 --> 00:02:00,436
Today, you have to do things

32
00:01:57,046 --> 00:02:00,436
Today, you have to do things

33
00:02:00,436 --> 00:02:03,106
Or revoke and recreate

34
00:02:03,556 --> 00:02:06,806
And that's a thing of the past.

35
00:02:06,806 --> 00:02:11,316
Yeah [applause] you're

36
00:02:11,316 --> 00:02:13,266
And after that, we're

37
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:18,446
to some new workflows that makes

38
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:21,936
And we'll finish by talking

39
00:02:22,206 --> 00:02:23,626
with setting up your projects.

40
00:02:24,146 --> 00:02:27,206
Let's talk about

41
00:02:28,136 --> 00:02:31,086
Now when Xcode builds

42
00:02:31,426 --> 00:02:34,866
behind the scenes it uses

43
00:02:35,886 --> 00:02:38,776
Now if you're new, you don't

44
00:02:39,176 --> 00:02:41,416
Xcode does this for

45
00:02:41,936 --> 00:02:44,536
And if you're experienced, you

46
00:02:44,876 --> 00:02:45,786
How does it work?

47
00:02:45,966 --> 00:02:47,906
Well, we use this codesign tool.

48
00:02:48,356 --> 00:02:51,766
And what codesign does is,

49
00:02:51,956 --> 00:02:53,786
and applies a code seal.

50
00:02:54,566 --> 00:02:57,336
And this allows the

51
00:02:57,336 --> 00:03:00,466
that have been made after

52
00:02:57,336 --> 00:03:00,466
that have been made after

53
00:03:01,676 --> 00:03:06,046
So if someone messes with your

54
00:03:07,296 --> 00:03:12,026
Codesign also applies a code

55
00:03:12,336 --> 00:03:13,976
So it can be identified.

56
00:03:14,146 --> 00:03:17,066
And people know where

57
00:03:20,136 --> 00:03:24,096
There are three things that you

58
00:03:24,886 --> 00:03:27,386
The first thing is a

59
00:03:27,716 --> 00:03:31,786
Signing certificates establish

60
00:03:33,156 --> 00:03:36,376
Provisioning profiles

61
00:03:36,556 --> 00:03:37,846
and they grant permissions.

62
00:03:38,466 --> 00:03:43,136
And entitlements declare

63
00:03:43,336 --> 00:03:44,876
Like iCloud or Wallet.

64
00:03:46,676 --> 00:03:48,006
So certificates.

65
00:03:48,526 --> 00:03:50,206
These are issued by Apple.

66
00:03:50,556 --> 00:03:53,946
And this is important because

67
00:03:53,946 --> 00:03:57,206
back to Apple so it

68
00:03:58,016 --> 00:04:00,526
And certificates

69
00:03:58,016 --> 00:04:00,526
And certificates

70
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:02,666
You have development

71
00:04:03,396 --> 00:04:04,626
which are for build and run.

72
00:04:05,026 --> 00:04:07,216
And you have distribution

73
00:04:07,586 --> 00:04:08,466
Which are used

74
00:04:08,566 --> 00:04:10,716
for authentication

75
00:04:11,296 --> 00:04:14,296
Or, if these are

76
00:04:14,466 --> 00:04:16,435
it's for distribution to users.

77
00:04:18,296 --> 00:04:22,466
And all signing certificates

78
00:04:22,906 --> 00:04:25,556
This private key has

79
00:04:25,716 --> 00:04:28,026
if you want to sign your apps.

80
00:04:28,206 --> 00:04:31,446
And the private key for

81
00:04:31,446 --> 00:04:33,276
when the certificate

82
00:04:33,276 --> 00:04:36,206
And so it's very important

83
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:38,836
And it's worth noting here

84
00:04:38,836 --> 00:04:42,056
that Apple never has a

85
00:04:42,196 --> 00:04:45,036
You can't go to the developer

86
00:04:45,536 --> 00:04:49,216
Now the good news

87
00:04:49,396 --> 00:04:51,836
for your development

88
00:04:51,836 --> 00:04:53,066
to worry about this anymore.

89
00:04:53,186 --> 00:04:57,106
And we'll talk more

90
00:04:57,226 --> 00:05:00,176
Provisioning profiles

91
00:04:57,226 --> 00:05:00,176
Provisioning profiles

92
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:03,646
And in contrast to

93
00:05:03,646 --> 00:05:05,616
about your identity

94
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:08,826
the profiles are

95
00:05:10,956 --> 00:05:14,856
Profiles allow access to

96
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:18,396
There's a list of

97
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:22,156
And at install time, the

98
00:05:22,156 --> 00:05:24,936
of identifiers to check

99
00:05:25,176 --> 00:05:28,006
And if it is, you

100
00:05:28,896 --> 00:05:33,066
Profiles also allow

101
00:05:33,506 --> 00:05:36,406
There's a white list of

102
00:05:36,786 --> 00:05:38,436
And if you want to

103
00:05:38,606 --> 00:05:40,416
it has to be in that list.

104
00:05:41,436 --> 00:05:43,116
Now once again, if you're new,

105
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:44,666
you don't need to

106
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:46,296
Xcode handles this for you.

107
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:48,196
And if you're experienced,

108
00:05:48,396 --> 00:05:51,366
you might be wondering

109
00:05:51,516 --> 00:05:54,246
when you add an entitlement

110
00:05:54,406 --> 00:05:57,186
It's because of that white list.

111
00:05:57,816 --> 00:05:59,256
Speaking of entitlements,

112
00:05:59,936 --> 00:06:02,766
entitlements declare

113
00:05:59,936 --> 00:06:02,766
entitlements declare

114
00:06:03,566 --> 00:06:06,826
And fundamentally an

115
00:06:07,326 --> 00:06:08,826
with an associated value.

116
00:06:08,996 --> 00:06:10,206
Like a string or a bowl.

117
00:06:10,736 --> 00:06:13,736
And these are defined

118
00:06:14,186 --> 00:06:16,886
So if your app uses one

119
00:06:17,286 --> 00:06:20,416
and your app extension uses

120
00:06:20,896 --> 00:06:25,966
And Xcode has a dedicated editor

121
00:06:26,336 --> 00:06:27,716
called the Capabilities tab.

122
00:06:28,316 --> 00:06:32,366
And the Capabilities tab will

123
00:06:32,596 --> 00:06:34,186
in the configuration details.

124
00:06:34,566 --> 00:06:36,976
So you don't have to visit

125
00:06:37,206 --> 00:06:39,336
You can do it all

126
00:06:39,876 --> 00:06:44,576
So those are the things you

127
00:06:45,026 --> 00:06:48,066
Now what happens when Xcode

128
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:50,326
It needs to know which

129
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:51,586
and which provision and profile.

130
00:06:52,106 --> 00:06:55,616
The way that works is,

131
00:06:56,276 --> 00:07:00,066
And then it looks at the list

132
00:06:56,276 --> 00:07:00,066
And then it looks at the list

133
00:07:00,376 --> 00:07:04,286
And it picks the newest one that

134
00:07:05,236 --> 00:07:07,866
Xcode then looks at

135
00:07:08,356 --> 00:07:11,326
And it picks the newest one

136
00:07:11,326 --> 00:07:14,056
And these two things

137
00:07:14,446 --> 00:07:16,776
The profile is embedded

138
00:07:17,736 --> 00:07:19,856
And the certificate

139
00:07:20,076 --> 00:07:21,206
to apply the code seal.

140
00:07:21,736 --> 00:07:25,266
So that's a quick

141
00:07:25,266 --> 00:07:28,286
of the fundamentals

142
00:07:29,346 --> 00:07:32,866
Let's talk now about the

143
00:07:32,866 --> 00:07:35,166
up new machines with

144
00:07:36,536 --> 00:07:38,926
So who's seen this before?

145
00:07:39,716 --> 00:07:42,956
Yeah. Your account

146
00:07:43,096 --> 00:07:45,016
and Xcode offers to reset it.

147
00:07:45,536 --> 00:07:49,096
So what happens when

148
00:07:49,246 --> 00:07:50,816
Yeah, so what happens

149
00:07:50,816 --> 00:07:52,706
of your current cert

150
00:07:53,586 --> 00:07:54,636
And why is this?

151
00:07:55,046 --> 00:07:57,616
Well, your development

152
00:07:57,616 --> 00:07:59,436
of one signing certificate.

153
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:03,646
And if you have a single

154
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:03,646
And if you have a single

155
00:08:04,036 --> 00:08:05,156
The cert is created.

156
00:08:05,156 --> 00:08:08,356
You have a private key that's

157
00:08:08,356 --> 00:08:10,296
in your keychain

158
00:08:11,236 --> 00:08:14,556
Now what happens if

159
00:08:15,056 --> 00:08:17,926
Well, to build and sign

160
00:08:18,426 --> 00:08:20,896
you need a signing

161
00:08:21,346 --> 00:08:26,206
And you can either sync that

162
00:08:26,206 --> 00:08:29,386
or Xcode and import the

163
00:08:30,226 --> 00:08:32,796
Or you can create a new

164
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:35,905
But that first requires

165
00:08:36,635 --> 00:08:39,816
And now you can build on the

166
00:08:39,816 --> 00:08:41,035
on your first Mac anymore.

167
00:08:41,635 --> 00:08:44,836
And it's easy to repeat this

168
00:08:44,836 --> 00:08:47,946
between being able to build on

169
00:08:47,946 --> 00:08:49,116
to build on another one.

170
00:08:49,116 --> 00:08:51,956
And this is really

171
00:08:52,856 --> 00:08:55,536
Well, the good news

172
00:08:55,536 --> 00:08:58,636
you can now have multiple

173
00:08:59,316 --> 00:09:00,146
So -- yeah [applause].

174
00:08:59,316 --> 00:09:00,146
So -- yeah [applause].

175
00:09:03,806 --> 00:09:07,206
Each of your machines can have

176
00:09:07,406 --> 00:09:08,396
and private key.

177
00:09:08,616 --> 00:09:11,566
So you never have to sync

178
00:09:12,316 --> 00:09:13,966
and you don't have

179
00:09:16,136 --> 00:09:20,026
These changes apply just for

180
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:23,336
Your distribution certs

181
00:09:23,336 --> 00:09:24,436
that you need to manage.

182
00:09:26,216 --> 00:09:30,286
These are created both through

183
00:09:30,686 --> 00:09:34,476
And these are created

184
00:09:36,186 --> 00:09:39,526
And if you have an old copy

185
00:09:39,976 --> 00:09:43,156
and you create one of these new

186
00:09:43,216 --> 00:09:45,466
They're 100% backwards

187
00:09:46,026 --> 00:09:50,436
So that's what we've changed

188
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:53,226
about signing certificates

189
00:09:54,436 --> 00:09:56,966
I'd like to turn the stage

190
00:09:56,966 --> 00:09:59,136
who's going to tell you

191
00:09:59,686 --> 00:10:02,296
in Xcode 8 [applause].

192
00:09:59,686 --> 00:10:02,296
in Xcode 8 [applause].

193
00:10:04,346 --> 00:10:05,286
&gt;&gt; Good morning everyone.

194
00:10:06,996 --> 00:10:09,436
So Joshua's walked us

195
00:10:09,486 --> 00:10:11,306
that are involved in

196
00:10:12,086 --> 00:10:15,806
You need a signing certificate

197
00:10:16,086 --> 00:10:18,516
that matches your device

198
00:10:19,136 --> 00:10:21,656
But many of you also

199
00:10:21,896 --> 00:10:22,686
Watch apps.

200
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:24,266
Or embedded frameworks

201
00:10:25,066 --> 00:10:27,586
And each of those brings its

202
00:10:28,796 --> 00:10:31,216
All this can add up to

203
00:10:31,346 --> 00:10:33,226
where signing becomes

204
00:10:34,276 --> 00:10:37,406
And fitting all the pieces

205
00:10:37,406 --> 00:10:38,326
difficult sometimes.

206
00:10:39,786 --> 00:10:42,986
So Xcode for many releases

207
00:10:42,986 --> 00:10:43,996
to help make this easier.

208
00:10:45,126 --> 00:10:49,416
In Xcode 7, the Fix Issue button

209
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:53,536
detected that something was

210
00:10:53,696 --> 00:10:57,166
Now sometimes clicking on Fix

211
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:59,056
and you can return to

212
00:10:59,756 --> 00:11:01,776
But a lot of the times it

213
00:10:59,756 --> 00:11:01,776
But a lot of the times it

214
00:11:01,776 --> 00:11:04,146
Or you had to click

215
00:11:04,986 --> 00:11:08,466
And in all cases, Xcode

216
00:11:08,466 --> 00:11:09,866
about what the issue was.

217
00:11:11,056 --> 00:11:13,066
What it did when you

218
00:11:13,766 --> 00:11:16,046
And really, if Xcode knew

219
00:11:16,546 --> 00:11:18,586
why did it need to interrupt

220
00:11:18,586 --> 00:11:21,076
and make you click a button?

221
00:11:21,196 --> 00:11:24,196
Interacting with signing

222
00:11:24,196 --> 00:11:25,966
like you were talking

223
00:11:25,966 --> 00:11:28,926
You couldn't see inside, but you

224
00:11:28,926 --> 00:11:29,956
whenever you got frustrated.

225
00:11:30,706 --> 00:11:32,606
So that didn't work

226
00:11:33,126 --> 00:11:35,796
And in Xcode 8 we've gotten

227
00:11:35,796 --> 00:11:38,286
But we've also done a lot more.

228
00:11:39,516 --> 00:11:42,896
[ Applause ]

229
00:11:43,396 --> 00:11:46,006
We fully redesigned how

230
00:11:46,986 --> 00:11:48,856
There's a brand new

231
00:11:49,456 --> 00:11:51,876
which is much faster and

232
00:11:53,116 --> 00:11:55,346
On top of that, we

233
00:11:55,676 --> 00:11:58,056
and a new user interface

234
00:11:58,406 --> 00:12:01,736
So you can see and manage

235
00:11:58,406 --> 00:12:01,736
So you can see and manage

236
00:12:01,736 --> 00:12:02,576
in one place.

237
00:12:03,086 --> 00:12:06,696
Then we took a look at

238
00:12:06,696 --> 00:12:08,196
with you about signing issues.

239
00:12:09,586 --> 00:12:12,316
A lot of the error messages

240
00:12:12,316 --> 00:12:13,066
or communicative.

241
00:12:13,446 --> 00:12:15,366
And so we've revised

242
00:12:15,816 --> 00:12:17,446
So that you see much

243
00:12:17,446 --> 00:12:19,846
and actionable information

244
00:12:21,336 --> 00:12:23,146
And for those of you

245
00:12:23,146 --> 00:12:24,996
about what Xcode

246
00:12:25,466 --> 00:12:27,016
when it fixes a signing problem.

247
00:12:27,516 --> 00:12:28,866
We've added new status

248
00:12:28,866 --> 00:12:31,886
So you can always see exactly

249
00:12:32,546 --> 00:12:36,426
So as Joshua mentioned

250
00:12:36,696 --> 00:12:40,356
there are two new ways of

251
00:12:40,846 --> 00:12:43,176
The first one is

252
00:12:44,636 --> 00:12:47,396
Now automatic signing has

253
00:12:47,586 --> 00:12:50,316
and it takes care of all of

254
00:12:51,816 --> 00:12:55,416
You'll never need to create a

255
00:12:55,646 --> 00:12:57,496
And Xcode will do it

256
00:12:57,656 --> 00:12:59,536
So while you're developing

257
00:12:59,906 --> 00:13:01,816
Xcode will keep your

258
00:12:59,906 --> 00:13:01,816
Xcode will keep your

259
00:13:04,906 --> 00:13:06,726
For those of you who

260
00:13:06,726 --> 00:13:08,336
over how your application

261
00:13:08,736 --> 00:13:10,506
you can enable customized

262
00:13:11,426 --> 00:13:15,046
In this mode, Xcode will

263
00:13:15,046 --> 00:13:16,526
of your provisioning profiles.

264
00:13:16,906 --> 00:13:18,736
And it will never change

265
00:13:19,956 --> 00:13:21,606
So let's take a look

266
00:13:21,606 --> 00:13:22,576
in a little bit more detail.

267
00:13:22,576 --> 00:13:24,276
Starting with automatic signing.

268
00:13:25,876 --> 00:13:27,826
When you create a new project,

269
00:13:28,246 --> 00:13:30,316
automatic signing

270
00:13:31,276 --> 00:13:32,856
But if you're an

271
00:13:32,856 --> 00:13:36,196
or you're opening an existing

272
00:13:36,196 --> 00:13:38,646
in the General tab in

273
00:13:40,136 --> 00:13:42,236
All you have to do

274
00:13:43,616 --> 00:13:46,006
And then tell Xcode

275
00:13:47,196 --> 00:13:50,346
From that point on, Xcode will

276
00:13:50,626 --> 00:13:52,096
and signing certificates

277
00:13:52,356 --> 00:13:54,806
And it will even show you

278
00:13:54,806 --> 00:13:57,626
that will be used when

279
00:13:58,676 --> 00:14:01,256
So what sorts of things will

280
00:13:58,676 --> 00:14:01,256
So what sorts of things will

281
00:14:01,686 --> 00:14:04,686
Well, it will create your

282
00:14:05,296 --> 00:14:06,766
So if you're developing

283
00:14:07,076 --> 00:14:09,696
it'll create an iOS

284
00:14:09,696 --> 00:14:14,206
It will also create and update

285
00:14:14,616 --> 00:14:15,256
And it does this

286
00:14:15,256 --> 00:14:17,926
in the background while you're

287
00:14:18,176 --> 00:14:19,976
So you can stay focused

288
00:14:20,486 --> 00:14:24,286
But there are still

289
00:14:24,406 --> 00:14:25,806
where Xcode 8 will prompt you.

290
00:14:26,286 --> 00:14:29,186
In particular, when you connect

291
00:14:30,196 --> 00:14:31,826
One that's not already

292
00:14:31,826 --> 00:14:32,876
on your development team.

293
00:14:33,756 --> 00:14:35,926
Xcode will ask you

294
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:38,816
Because we know device limits

295
00:14:38,816 --> 00:14:40,896
to have full control over

296
00:14:41,376 --> 00:14:46,166
And finally, if you're

297
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:47,676
on your behalf in

298
00:14:48,056 --> 00:14:49,336
you can view the signing report

299
00:14:50,216 --> 00:14:51,946
to see exactly what

300
00:14:53,016 --> 00:14:55,786
So let me show you how this

301
00:14:56,036 --> 00:15:00,746
So I'm going to show you

302
00:14:56,036 --> 00:15:00,746
So I'm going to show you

303
00:15:00,746 --> 00:15:03,466
using a brand new iOS app.

304
00:15:05,456 --> 00:15:06,536
I'll hit Next.

305
00:15:07,506 --> 00:15:09,216
And I'll give this a name.

306
00:15:10,496 --> 00:15:12,756
I'm not a great cook,

307
00:15:13,876 --> 00:15:16,586
Now the first thing I'd

308
00:15:16,586 --> 00:15:20,766
to in the new project assistant

309
00:15:21,216 --> 00:15:23,126
When you create your project,

310
00:15:23,436 --> 00:15:26,176
you can immediately choose the

311
00:15:26,176 --> 00:15:27,286
like to use for signing.

312
00:15:27,826 --> 00:15:28,966
And from that point on,

313
00:15:29,306 --> 00:15:31,106
your project will

314
00:15:31,106 --> 00:15:33,496
for automatic signing

315
00:15:34,186 --> 00:15:36,846
So I'll just hit Next.

316
00:15:37,506 --> 00:15:41,196
And I'll create this

317
00:15:42,396 --> 00:15:44,306
So what did Xcode just do?

318
00:15:44,866 --> 00:15:46,296
It created a brand new project,

319
00:15:46,616 --> 00:15:48,916
and automatic signing

320
00:15:50,246 --> 00:15:51,466
When I created the project,

321
00:15:51,926 --> 00:15:54,156
it immediately generated

322
00:15:54,516 --> 00:15:56,156
and a provisioning

323
00:15:57,556 --> 00:15:59,746
I can zoom in on here

324
00:16:04,136 --> 00:16:05,786
If I'd like to change

325
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:07,556
I can also do that there.

326
00:16:11,356 --> 00:16:14,406
So that's how easy it is to

327
00:16:15,206 --> 00:16:17,316
I can immediately build

328
00:16:17,366 --> 00:16:19,106
I never had to click "Fix Issue"

329
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:21,396
or configure any

330
00:16:21,746 --> 00:16:24,856
All I did was create a new

331
00:16:25,566 --> 00:16:27,506
But let's make this a

332
00:16:29,076 --> 00:16:32,636
As Joshua mentioned earlier,

333
00:16:33,386 --> 00:16:35,066
to enable platform

334
00:16:35,066 --> 00:16:36,586
like to use, like Cloud Kit.

335
00:16:37,136 --> 00:16:38,846
So let's do that in

336
00:16:40,176 --> 00:16:42,396
We'll go to the Capabilities

337
00:16:43,426 --> 00:16:45,166
And here I see all

338
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:46,556
that my app can support.

339
00:16:47,086 --> 00:16:50,156
And all I have to do is flip

340
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:55,826
I'd like to use Cloud Kit

341
00:16:57,726 --> 00:17:01,456
So when I did that, Xcode made

342
00:16:57,726 --> 00:17:01,456
So when I did that, Xcode made

343
00:17:01,766 --> 00:17:02,846
It linked frameworks.

344
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:04,516
It modified my Entitlement's

345
00:17:04,516 --> 00:17:07,616
But it also communicated

346
00:17:08,146 --> 00:17:09,406
to download a new profile.

347
00:17:10,806 --> 00:17:12,536
And now I can build

348
00:17:12,536 --> 00:17:15,435
And I can immediately

349
00:17:15,435 --> 00:17:17,695
Again, I never had to

350
00:17:17,945 --> 00:17:19,856
or type in any entitlements

351
00:17:21,026 --> 00:17:23,715
Now, I happen to know that

352
00:17:23,715 --> 00:17:25,066
because I'm an Xcode engineer.

353
00:17:25,646 --> 00:17:27,236
But most of you probably aren't.

354
00:17:27,915 --> 00:17:31,656
So if you're curious about what

355
00:17:31,656 --> 00:17:33,176
over to the Reports Navigator.

356
00:17:34,176 --> 00:17:36,916
Where you'll see a brand new

357
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:41,506
Whenever Xcode resolves a

358
00:17:41,996 --> 00:17:43,796
one of these reports

359
00:17:44,376 --> 00:17:46,036
Let's take a look at

360
00:17:46,306 --> 00:17:48,096
to see what it contains.

361
00:17:49,936 --> 00:17:51,956
And I'll zoom in to

362
00:17:53,516 --> 00:17:56,246
So here we can see Xcode

363
00:17:56,886 --> 00:18:00,286
And I can see more information

364
00:17:56,886 --> 00:18:00,286
And I can see more information

365
00:18:00,286 --> 00:18:01,736
that row and expanding it.

366
00:18:03,206 --> 00:18:06,226
So Xcode's telling me my

367
00:18:06,226 --> 00:18:07,066
support iCloud.

368
00:18:08,286 --> 00:18:09,936
And immediately below that,

369
00:18:09,936 --> 00:18:12,656
I can see that it created

370
00:18:13,966 --> 00:18:17,106
So that's how easy it is to

371
00:18:17,106 --> 00:18:19,216
on my behalf whenever

372
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:29,546
[ Applause ]

373
00:18:30,046 --> 00:18:31,446
Now there are a few more

374
00:18:31,446 --> 00:18:32,636
about automatic signing.

375
00:18:33,886 --> 00:18:36,396
The first one is that it

376
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,546
Distribution is handled

377
00:18:39,546 --> 00:18:41,696
which Joshua will describe

378
00:18:42,936 --> 00:18:46,396
And it's limited to Xcode

379
00:18:47,216 --> 00:18:49,846
These of course are profiles

380
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:51,456
and it keeps them up-to-date

381
00:18:51,636 --> 00:18:53,316
as you're working

382
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:58,876
And as a result of these,

383
00:18:59,046 --> 00:19:00,406
without ever having to worry

384
00:18:59,046 --> 00:19:00,406
without ever having to worry

385
00:19:00,406 --> 00:19:04,246
about your distribution signing

386
00:19:05,086 --> 00:19:06,616
So your distribution certificate

387
00:19:06,616 --> 00:19:09,036
and provisioning profile

388
00:19:09,036 --> 00:19:10,096
by automatic signing.

389
00:19:12,136 --> 00:19:14,436
So automatic signing.

390
00:19:14,436 --> 00:19:16,736
It's been completely

391
00:19:17,366 --> 00:19:20,886
It stays out of your way,

392
00:19:21,216 --> 00:19:23,266
So you can focus on

393
00:19:23,266 --> 00:19:26,376
which is developing your app.

394
00:19:27,306 --> 00:19:29,296
Now let's take a look at

395
00:19:29,356 --> 00:19:30,486
Customized signing.

396
00:19:31,516 --> 00:19:34,536
As you'll recall, this is a

397
00:19:34,536 --> 00:19:35,816
over how your app is signed.

398
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:40,706
You can enable customized

399
00:19:41,076 --> 00:19:43,726
by unchecking the checkbox

400
00:19:44,866 --> 00:19:46,426
And once you've done that,

401
00:19:46,426 --> 00:19:49,516
Xcode will let you choose

402
00:19:49,516 --> 00:19:51,286
for each of your

403
00:19:52,516 --> 00:19:55,576
This is really handy if you have

404
00:19:55,576 --> 00:19:57,896
Or you need different

405
00:19:57,896 --> 00:19:59,076
and paid versions of your app.

406
00:19:59,506 --> 00:20:00,876
Now you have the

407
00:19:59,506 --> 00:20:00,876
Now you have the

408
00:20:01,286 --> 00:20:04,086
And you can configure this

409
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:06,626
You don't have to visit the

410
00:20:09,146 --> 00:20:10,946
So this is a really

411
00:20:10,946 --> 00:20:12,856
for configuring your

412
00:20:13,336 --> 00:20:15,276
But we wanted to take

413
00:20:16,146 --> 00:20:19,096
Those of you who have manually

414
00:20:19,406 --> 00:20:22,476
have probably run into

415
00:20:22,476 --> 00:20:25,366
or runtime issues usually

416
00:20:25,956 --> 00:20:28,956
And we wanted Xcode to give

417
00:20:28,956 --> 00:20:31,466
about that before you

418
00:20:32,426 --> 00:20:35,086
So we've added new

419
00:20:35,086 --> 00:20:36,176
within the General tab.

420
00:20:36,626 --> 00:20:38,956
And you can see this right

421
00:20:39,316 --> 00:20:41,216
So it's easier to

422
00:20:42,496 --> 00:20:46,166
Here I can see that my profile

423
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:47,256
that my app is using.

424
00:20:47,556 --> 00:20:49,646
So I know exactly what

425
00:20:49,646 --> 00:20:50,646
to resolve the problem.

426
00:20:53,236 --> 00:20:58,566
In addition, I can

427
00:20:58,566 --> 00:20:59,956
about my provisioning profile

428
00:20:59,956 --> 00:21:02,146
by clicking the profile

429
00:20:59,956 --> 00:21:02,146
by clicking the profile

430
00:21:03,326 --> 00:21:05,736
And here I can see

431
00:21:05,736 --> 00:21:07,556
Like when my profile

432
00:21:08,126 --> 00:21:09,676
Which capabilities it supports.

433
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:12,536
And again, it's easy to

434
00:21:12,776 --> 00:21:15,286
exactly what I need

435
00:21:17,936 --> 00:21:20,366
Now customized signing

436
00:21:20,366 --> 00:21:22,156
to manually created profiles.

437
00:21:22,616 --> 00:21:24,826
These are profiles

438
00:21:24,826 --> 00:21:27,966
on your team has created

439
00:21:28,566 --> 00:21:30,456
And Xcode will never

440
00:21:30,946 --> 00:21:34,176
And you can choose

441
00:21:34,176 --> 00:21:37,236
So as I mentioned, if you want

442
00:21:37,236 --> 00:21:40,376
for some build configurations,

443
00:21:40,376 --> 00:21:45,766
for others, you're

444
00:21:45,976 --> 00:21:47,236
Now this is a really cool thing.

445
00:21:47,236 --> 00:21:49,956
Especially for those of

446
00:21:49,956 --> 00:21:52,126
who have manually chosen

447
00:21:52,936 --> 00:21:53,876
There's a new build setting

448
00:21:53,876 --> 00:21:56,736
in Xcode 8 called

449
00:21:57,736 --> 00:22:00,196
And what this does is it

450
00:21:57,736 --> 00:22:00,196
And what this does is it

451
00:22:00,196 --> 00:22:00,836
by name.

452
00:22:02,076 --> 00:22:05,816
Now the reason this is a

453
00:22:05,816 --> 00:22:08,516
to Xcode 8, Xcode would

454
00:22:08,516 --> 00:22:10,296
by their unique ID.

455
00:22:10,696 --> 00:22:12,426
Whenever a new developer

456
00:22:12,426 --> 00:22:13,696
or you added a new device,

457
00:22:14,146 --> 00:22:16,736
you'd need to generate a

458
00:22:16,736 --> 00:22:19,246
And when you did that,

459
00:22:19,536 --> 00:22:21,466
So then you'd need to

460
00:22:22,756 --> 00:22:26,376
Well, now in Xcode 8, since

461
00:22:26,826 --> 00:22:29,216
all you need to do is

462
00:22:29,676 --> 00:22:31,586
and Xcode will automatically

463
00:22:31,586 --> 00:22:36,326
You don't need to update your

464
00:22:37,516 --> 00:22:40,396
[ Applause ]

465
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:41,516
So let's take a look

466
00:22:41,516 --> 00:22:43,806
at how customized signing

467
00:22:50,456 --> 00:22:54,356
Okay. I'm going to show you

468
00:22:54,356 --> 00:22:55,596
on called, Scrapbook.

469
00:22:56,236 --> 00:22:59,186
And let me zoom in on that.

470
00:23:00,596 --> 00:23:02,936
So Scrapbook is set up

471
00:23:03,996 --> 00:23:06,166
I've chosen different

472
00:23:06,166 --> 00:23:07,506
and paid versions of my app.

473
00:23:08,986 --> 00:23:10,226
And it's really easy

474
00:23:10,226 --> 00:23:11,636
that in the General tab.

475
00:23:12,046 --> 00:23:13,226
This is all I had to do.

476
00:23:13,636 --> 00:23:15,846
Just select different

477
00:23:16,726 --> 00:23:18,716
And since I don't see

478
00:23:19,286 --> 00:23:21,856
I already know I can

479
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:22,886
and everything will work.

480
00:23:24,676 --> 00:23:26,536
But as in the earlier demo,

481
00:23:26,756 --> 00:23:28,456
let's make this a

482
00:23:29,086 --> 00:23:32,106
I'd like to use the Capabilities

483
00:23:32,106 --> 00:23:34,186
and Push Notifications

484
00:23:35,426 --> 00:23:38,006
Now if you've used the

485
00:23:38,446 --> 00:23:40,976
with a manually specified

486
00:23:41,546 --> 00:23:43,966
you might've noticed that it

487
00:23:43,966 --> 00:23:44,816
signing settings.

488
00:23:44,816 --> 00:23:46,676
Or make changes that

489
00:23:47,756 --> 00:23:51,406
In Xcode 8, the Capabilities

490
00:23:51,486 --> 00:23:52,696
in customized signing mode.

491
00:23:53,446 --> 00:23:56,386
It'll make the local changes

492
00:23:56,386 --> 00:23:58,816
such as updating your

493
00:23:59,556 --> 00:24:01,096
But it won't touch

494
00:23:59,556 --> 00:24:01,096
But it won't touch

495
00:24:01,286 --> 00:24:04,426
It'll just tell you what steps

496
00:24:04,456 --> 00:24:06,066
in order to resolve

497
00:24:06,536 --> 00:24:07,626
So let's take a look at that.

498
00:24:12,076 --> 00:24:16,256
I'll click on Capabilities,

499
00:24:16,886 --> 00:24:18,096
and Push Notifications.

500
00:24:22,046 --> 00:24:25,216
Now Xcode is showing me

501
00:24:25,216 --> 00:24:26,356
that it was able to complete.

502
00:24:26,826 --> 00:24:29,756
And little error icons next

503
00:24:29,756 --> 00:24:31,496
to complete on the

504
00:24:31,606 --> 00:24:36,056
I can see more information

505
00:24:37,556 --> 00:24:39,626
I'll zoom in on that.

506
00:24:42,646 --> 00:24:44,306
And if you look at

507
00:24:44,306 --> 00:24:47,206
you can see Xcode's telling

508
00:24:47,206 --> 00:24:49,076
support iCloud and

509
00:24:49,676 --> 00:24:51,806
That's kind of obvious

510
00:24:52,436 --> 00:24:53,666
But it's really clear.

511
00:24:53,666 --> 00:24:56,196
I can tell exactly what I need

512
00:24:56,706 --> 00:24:58,776
Whereas in the past, if I

513
00:24:59,126 --> 00:25:01,886
my app either wouldn't install

514
00:24:59,126 --> 00:25:01,886
my app either wouldn't install

515
00:25:04,016 --> 00:25:06,046
And finally, if I want

516
00:25:06,426 --> 00:25:08,096
I can click the Profile

517
00:25:08,656 --> 00:25:12,626
And Xcode will show me more

518
00:25:12,626 --> 00:25:15,676
Like the capabilities that it

519
00:25:16,076 --> 00:25:18,876
So again, it's easy to

520
00:25:18,876 --> 00:25:20,056
to do to fix a problem.

521
00:25:21,026 --> 00:25:22,146
So let's go fix this one.

522
00:25:23,406 --> 00:25:26,296
As I mentioned earlier, in

523
00:25:26,406 --> 00:25:28,676
Xcode won't modify

524
00:25:29,106 --> 00:25:31,776
I need to visit the developer

525
00:25:33,156 --> 00:25:36,336
So I'll open up the

526
00:25:36,336 --> 00:25:38,456
on Certificates,

527
00:25:39,296 --> 00:25:42,426
The first thing I need to

528
00:25:43,546 --> 00:25:44,766
So I'll select App IDs.

529
00:25:45,576 --> 00:25:48,536
And I'll choose the app ID I've

530
00:25:49,446 --> 00:25:52,246
This shows me all the

531
00:25:52,646 --> 00:25:53,666
I'll hit, Edit.

532
00:25:54,616 --> 00:25:57,026
Scroll down and turn on iCloud.

533
00:25:58,466 --> 00:26:01,576
Now this alert message that

534
00:25:58,466 --> 00:26:01,576
Now this alert message that

535
00:26:01,576 --> 00:26:03,296
that after I update my app ID,

536
00:26:03,546 --> 00:26:05,236
I also need to download

537
00:26:05,236 --> 00:26:06,556
of my provisioning profile.

538
00:26:07,106 --> 00:26:08,006
So I'll just hit, Okay.

539
00:26:08,566 --> 00:26:13,586
And then I'd like to enable

540
00:26:13,586 --> 00:26:14,806
So I'll turn that on.

541
00:26:15,396 --> 00:26:17,596
And again I'm reminded

542
00:26:18,146 --> 00:26:21,616
So I'll click, Okay.

543
00:26:21,806 --> 00:26:24,136
Scroll down and turn

544
00:26:25,076 --> 00:26:25,906
And now I'm done.

545
00:26:27,476 --> 00:26:29,466
The next step is

546
00:26:29,726 --> 00:26:31,196
So I'm going to click

547
00:26:32,466 --> 00:26:35,286
And you'll see the two scrapbook

548
00:26:35,286 --> 00:26:35,906
as invalid.

549
00:26:36,506 --> 00:26:38,456
That's because I've made

550
00:26:38,756 --> 00:26:40,896
But I haven't regenerated

551
00:26:41,466 --> 00:26:42,386
So they're out of date.

552
00:26:43,286 --> 00:26:45,496
Let's update the

553
00:26:46,116 --> 00:26:48,976
I'll select it and click, Edit.

554
00:26:49,456 --> 00:26:51,306
And I can scroll down

555
00:26:51,306 --> 00:26:54,656
I'm not making changes

556
00:26:55,386 --> 00:26:56,726
And I'll click on Generate.

557
00:26:57,336 --> 00:26:59,196
And then download

558
00:27:00,316 --> 00:27:03,226
Now the very last step is I

559
00:27:03,226 --> 00:27:04,846
so that Xcode can use it.

560
00:27:05,176 --> 00:27:08,176
I can do that just by clicking

561
00:27:09,896 --> 00:27:11,336
So what just happened there?

562
00:27:12,076 --> 00:27:12,936
I'll zoom in on that.

563
00:27:14,156 --> 00:27:16,866
When I clicked on the

564
00:27:18,016 --> 00:27:20,386
and immediately updated

565
00:27:20,516 --> 00:27:23,366
So we can see the errors in

566
00:27:23,366 --> 00:27:24,936
of my app have disappeared.

567
00:27:26,576 --> 00:27:28,596
You might also have noticed

568
00:27:28,836 --> 00:27:30,816
that I didn't make any

569
00:27:31,396 --> 00:27:34,056
This is provisioning profile

570
00:27:34,056 --> 00:27:34,526
the scenes.

571
00:27:35,116 --> 00:27:37,226
Once I installed the new

572
00:27:37,726 --> 00:27:40,056
Xcode just started

573
00:27:40,876 --> 00:27:43,296
Now I can build and run

574
00:27:43,836 --> 00:27:44,836
and everything will work.

575
00:27:44,836 --> 00:27:46,176
I can use iCloud and Push.

576
00:27:47,726 --> 00:27:48,776
But it looks like I still need

577
00:27:48,776 --> 00:27:50,486
to update the premium

578
00:27:50,946 --> 00:27:53,446
Does everybody want to see me do

579
00:27:53,446 --> 00:27:54,606
Or we get the idea?

580
00:27:55,646 --> 00:27:57,896
Okay. It's a little bit tedious.

581
00:27:59,166 --> 00:28:01,216
If you were paying

582
00:27:59,166 --> 00:28:01,216
If you were paying

583
00:28:01,216 --> 00:28:03,026
you might have noticed

584
00:28:03,116 --> 00:28:05,876
all those steps I just performed

585
00:28:05,876 --> 00:28:08,686
that Xcode performed for

586
00:28:09,266 --> 00:28:11,996
So that's customized signing.

587
00:28:12,326 --> 00:28:15,426
A brand new mode in Xcode 8,

588
00:28:15,426 --> 00:28:16,696
over how your app is signed.

589
00:28:17,176 --> 00:28:19,416
Xcode won't interfere

590
00:28:19,726 --> 00:28:21,206
or modify your profiles.

591
00:28:21,726 --> 00:28:24,336
But I'd like to encourage

592
00:28:24,336 --> 00:28:25,546
out automatic signing.

593
00:28:26,646 --> 00:28:28,666
It's been completely

594
00:28:28,666 --> 00:28:31,066
and it's provides a really

595
00:28:31,066 --> 00:28:32,346
that I think you'll

596
00:28:32,936 --> 00:28:35,626
Now I'd like to invite

597
00:28:35,626 --> 00:28:37,606
up to show you some best

598
00:28:40,046 --> 00:28:40,556
&gt;&gt; Thanks Itai [applause].

599
00:28:44,046 --> 00:28:47,776
So we just saw the new

600
00:28:47,776 --> 00:28:50,826
that makes it really easy

601
00:28:51,886 --> 00:28:54,486
Now I'd like to talk

602
00:28:54,686 --> 00:28:56,806
for managing signing

603
00:28:58,296 --> 00:29:00,836
The first thing is,

604
00:28:58,296 --> 00:29:00,836
The first thing is,

605
00:29:01,186 --> 00:29:04,756
Automatic is designed to make

606
00:29:05,296 --> 00:29:07,436
And it works great

607
00:29:07,436 --> 00:29:10,756
with individual developers,

608
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:14,526
So you should add all of the

609
00:29:14,966 --> 00:29:16,766
to your development team.

610
00:29:17,456 --> 00:29:21,246
You should use the Capabilities

611
00:29:21,496 --> 00:29:23,716
So you can avoid visiting

612
00:29:23,826 --> 00:29:26,426
to configure things

613
00:29:27,136 --> 00:29:33,296
If you use customized signing,

614
00:29:33,846 --> 00:29:36,036
You have a specific

615
00:29:36,146 --> 00:29:37,756
that is linked to your account.

616
00:29:38,306 --> 00:29:41,266
So if you set this to your

617
00:29:41,486 --> 00:29:43,186
and someone else

618
00:29:43,746 --> 00:29:44,946
they won't be able to build.

619
00:29:45,356 --> 00:29:47,516
So you should leave that

620
00:29:48,856 --> 00:29:51,616
Instead of visiting the

621
00:29:51,836 --> 00:29:53,116
you should use the new UI

622
00:29:53,296 --> 00:29:55,456
in the General tab

623
00:29:56,186 --> 00:29:59,936
This allows you to see more

624
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:04,736
And it also correctly sets

625
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:04,736
And it also correctly sets

626
00:30:05,016 --> 00:30:07,096
so you can avoid churn

627
00:30:07,656 --> 00:30:11,306
You should also use

628
00:30:11,506 --> 00:30:14,566
in Customized Signing Mode to

629
00:30:15,036 --> 00:30:19,526
And if you use development

630
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:23,276
of your project's configuration,

631
00:30:23,836 --> 00:30:26,606
When you get back to your

632
00:30:26,606 --> 00:30:30,966
in the target editor

633
00:30:31,726 --> 00:30:34,436
When it comes to

634
00:30:34,436 --> 00:30:37,306
Xcode has a dedicated

635
00:30:37,646 --> 00:30:40,576
And it's based around

636
00:30:42,246 --> 00:30:44,396
Archives contain a

637
00:30:45,736 --> 00:30:47,306
And it's important to note

638
00:30:47,306 --> 00:30:49,306
that you should use

639
00:30:50,316 --> 00:30:53,426
If you sign your app with

640
00:30:53,826 --> 00:30:56,296
you won't be able to

641
00:30:56,296 --> 00:30:57,666
that you were trying to develop.

642
00:30:58,386 --> 00:31:00,746
So this should be

643
00:30:58,386 --> 00:31:00,746
So this should be

644
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:03,636
And when it comes time

645
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:05,276
when you use the organizer,

646
00:31:05,626 --> 00:31:09,696
Xcode will resign the app using

647
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:11,466
and provisioning profiles.

648
00:31:12,356 --> 00:31:14,656
And if you clicked

649
00:31:14,656 --> 00:31:15,436
to iTunes connect.

650
00:31:16,206 --> 00:31:20,406
Or if you clicked Export,

651
00:31:20,506 --> 00:31:22,316
that has been distribution

652
00:31:23,456 --> 00:31:28,866
So that's the best practice

653
00:31:29,356 --> 00:31:30,746
We've covered a few

654
00:31:30,746 --> 00:31:33,966
We've talked about the new

655
00:31:34,166 --> 00:31:37,216
that makes it really easy

656
00:31:37,936 --> 00:31:40,326
We've talked about the

657
00:31:40,726 --> 00:31:43,896
which takes a lot of the pain

658
00:31:44,756 --> 00:31:47,636
And we talked about the new

659
00:31:47,956 --> 00:31:51,016
So you can configure your

660
00:31:51,246 --> 00:31:52,356
If that's what you desire.

661
00:31:52,936 --> 00:31:56,536
If you want to learn

662
00:31:57,766 --> 00:32:00,686
If you want to learn more

663
00:31:57,766 --> 00:32:00,686
If you want to learn more

664
00:32:01,006 --> 00:32:02,126
check out these sessions.

665
00:32:02,976 --> 00:32:04,536
And with that, thank you.

666
