My name is Matt Patenaude.

I'm a software engineer

And welcome to Session 408,

00:00:36,186 --> 00:00:40,776
I am absolutely thrilled to be

and boy have we got

13
00:00:44,566 --> 00:00:46,766
So with that in mind, we

14
00:00:47,646 --> 00:00:51,036
So you've had 48 hours

15
00:00:51,036 --> 00:00:52,886
so I'm sure a lot of you

16
00:00:53,176 --> 00:00:54,936
But if some of you

Swift Playgrounds is a really

00:01:00,616 --> 00:01:03,996
that allows you to program

00:01:04,075 --> 00:01:06,666
of Swift literally to

we've got you covered.

00:01:11,316 --> 00:01:14,336
We've built a great

00:01:14,676 --> 00:01:16,276
that you can download

26
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:20,186

regardless of what level

28
00:01:22,726 --> 00:01:25,136
And if nothing else, you can

00:01:30,326 --> 00:01:32,336
If you are a little

31
00:01:32,336 --> 00:01:34,346
we've also given you some

that you couldn't

00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:48,296
you can take any of

and we know you're going

41
00:01:57,356 --> 00:01:59,006
to do some really

42
00:01:59,386 --> 00:02:01,316

And as such, we got

Thanks Matt.

62
00:02:44,656 --> 00:02:47,826
So we're going to start off by

63
00:02:47,826 --> 00:02:50,076
of Swift Playgrounds,

64
00:02:50,076 --> 00:02:51,636
of the different parts

65
00:02:51,856 --> 00:02:56,216
So up at the left, the

66
00:02:56,216 --> 00:02:57,176
we've got the source editor.

67
00:02:57,176 --> 00:02:58,406
On the right, we've

68
00:02:58,966 --> 00:03:00,826
Now the source editor is

69
00:02:58,966 --> 00:03:00,826
Now the source editor is

70
00:03:00,826 --> 00:03:01,736
of different sections.

71
00:03:02,036 --> 00:03:06,286
So one type of section

72
00:03:06,526 --> 00:03:09,006
and you'll see that we've

73
00:03:09,006 --> 00:03:11,966
This can be interspersed

74
00:03:12,406 --> 00:03:14,456
and this is the rich text

75
00:03:14,456 --> 00:03:16,226
to help you learn

Underneath, we've got an

77
00:03:19,586 --> 00:03:22,686
So here, this is where you'll

78
00:03:23,446 --> 00:03:26,246
Along the bottom of the screen,

79
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:28,956
In the center of that,

80
00:03:29,436 --> 00:03:31,616
and this depending on

81
00:03:32,036 --> 00:03:35,026
On the left, we have the

82
00:03:35,326 --> 00:03:38,316
and on the right we have the

83
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:39,966
One is to delete something.

84
00:03:40,506 --> 00:03:42,336
The next is to insert

85
00:03:42,476 --> 00:03:43,886
And the third is to

86
00:03:44,576 --> 00:03:48,996

00:03:48,996 --> 00:03:50,236
without needing the keyboard.

88
00:03:50,946 --> 00:03:53,486

to your documents, the button to

95
00:04:11,856 --> 00:04:14,586
that shows you all of

Next to that, we have

102
00:04:37,346 --> 00:04:39,446
that could be inside of your

103

And thirdly, we have file

that you can drag out of the

105
00:04:49,046 --> 00:04:51,346
And in the Tools menu, this

106
00:04:51,546 --> 00:04:53,826
about the app, a

107
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:57,326
with the document, two

108
00:04:57,326 --> 00:04:59,586
about your document,

109

which takes movie of what you're

110
00:04:59,646 --> 00:05:02,736
which takes movie of what you're

111
00:05:02,946 --> 00:05:05,346
which will save a

112
00:05:05,746 --> 00:05:08,446
And finally, the Reset Page

113
00:05:08,446 --> 00:05:09,656
to the original state.

114
00:05:10,386 --> 00:05:14,686
So here we are in the document

115
00:05:14,686 --> 00:05:16,106
got a whole bunch of documents.

116
00:05:16,436 --> 00:05:19,516
I'm going to open up the

117
00:05:19,516 --> 00:05:20,346
that I've got here.

118
00:05:21,296 --> 00:05:23,516
So I've only got one

119
00:05:23,886 --> 00:05:25,386
Let rectangle equals value.

120
00:05:25,976 --> 00:05:28,266
I want to draw some

121
00:05:28,516 --> 00:05:29,426
because I think that'll be fun.

122
00:05:29,916 --> 00:05:33,876
So I'm going to tap on Value,

123
00:05:33,876 --> 00:05:35,176
up code completion

124
00:05:35,176 --> 00:05:36,866
Got a whole bunch of

125
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:42,246
So I'm going to find a rectangle

126
00:05:42,276 --> 00:05:44,736
and dragging to the left to

127
00:05:44,956 --> 00:05:45,726
So there's a rectangle.

128
00:05:46,516 --> 00:05:47,026
Tap on that.

129
00:05:47,026 --> 00:05:48,776
It gets inserted

130
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:51,836
Now notice, there's

131
00:05:51,966 --> 00:05:52,996
in the left side of the screen.

132
00:05:53,366 --> 00:05:55,526
So that's a live issue

133
00:05:56,156 --> 00:05:57,196
We're going to tap on that.

134
00:05:57,636 --> 00:05:59,136
It tells me there's

135
00:05:59,576 --> 00:06:01,606
I needed to add parens

136
00:05:59,576 --> 00:06:01,606
I needed to add parens

137
00:06:02,036 --> 00:06:03,446
So here we provide fix-its.

138
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:04,886
You can tap on the first one,

139
00:06:05,046 --> 00:06:06,886
and then that will get

140
00:06:07,296 --> 00:06:08,356
The orange circle goes away.

141
00:06:09,226 --> 00:06:13,476
Now tap on my code, and we

142
00:06:14,126 --> 00:06:16,546
It's a square, but.

143
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:20,156
Now notice when we move down,

144
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:22,466
we've now got Rectangle

145
00:06:22,906 --> 00:06:25,336
So I'm going to tap on

146
00:06:25,336 --> 00:06:27,206
and now it's going to list

147
00:06:27,206 --> 00:06:28,926
and functions that I

148
00:06:29,686 --> 00:06:32,756
Let's make this a

149
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:35,186
by changing the border's

150
00:06:35,566 --> 00:06:37,176
So let's start out by

151
00:06:37,806 --> 00:06:38,936
We get an equal operator.

152
00:06:38,936 --> 00:06:39,946
Tap on that.

153
00:06:40,486 --> 00:06:43,226
And we get a placeholder

154
00:06:43,226 --> 00:06:45,386
Now notice the second item

155
00:06:45,386 --> 00:06:47,626
in code completion

156
00:06:48,156 --> 00:06:51,586
That means that we can insert

157
00:06:51,656 --> 00:06:55,596
So I'm going to tap on that, and

158
00:06:56,176 --> 00:06:57,466
Tapping on that brings

159
00:06:57,466 --> 00:06:59,666
up a quick editor

160
00:07:00,306 --> 00:07:01,816
There's a whole bunch

161
00:07:01,816 --> 00:07:03,976
of Swift Playgrounds, and

162
00:07:03,976 --> 00:07:05,946
So I'm going to change

163
00:07:06,606 --> 00:07:08,106
and let's tap Run My Code.

164
00:07:08,746 --> 00:07:10,656
And now it's going

165
00:07:10,656 --> 00:07:12,286
It's not very visible,

166
00:07:12,286 --> 00:07:14,226
to increase the border

167
00:07:14,896 --> 00:07:16,346
Tap on Rectangle.

168
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:17,796
Tap on dot.

169
00:07:18,286 --> 00:07:22,476
Tap on Border Width equals, and

170
00:07:22,856 --> 00:07:24,676
which also brings

171
00:07:24,956 --> 00:07:26,036
so we can punch in a number.

172
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:27,816
Going to punch in four.

173
00:07:27,816 --> 00:07:30,726
Oops. And tap Run.

174
00:07:31,346 --> 00:07:33,616
And now it's a bit more seeable.

175
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:37,556
Now I'm going to -- I want

176
00:07:37,886 --> 00:07:41,116
that will draw a square

177
00:07:41,116 --> 00:07:41,706
in the live view.

178
00:07:41,706 --> 00:07:43,896
So I'm going to do a bit

179
00:07:44,006 --> 00:07:45,796
and I want to hide

180
00:07:45,906 --> 00:07:47,406
just to give me some

181
00:07:47,406 --> 00:07:49,726
So I'm going to tap and hold

182
00:07:49,906 --> 00:07:51,626
and it's going to split

183
00:07:51,876 --> 00:07:53,896
Now drag to the right to

184
00:07:55,366 --> 00:07:57,776
Let's tap at the

185
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:02,216
Now Swift Playgrounds also has a

186
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:02,216
Now Swift Playgrounds also has a

187
00:08:02,216 --> 00:08:03,836
to do programming with

188
00:08:04,146 --> 00:08:06,396
So I'll tap the Keyboard

189
00:08:07,276 --> 00:08:09,676
Notice the keys have

190
00:08:09,806 --> 00:08:10,546
but more on that later.

191
00:08:11,686 --> 00:08:14,976
Let's start by using the canvas

192
00:08:14,976 --> 00:08:17,606
of the shapes playground to

193
00:08:18,026 --> 00:08:19,296
So I'll type C-a-n.

194
00:08:19,756 --> 00:08:21,156
Gives us a canvas object.

195
00:08:21,716 --> 00:08:25,316
Type Shared to get

196
00:08:25,746 --> 00:08:27,056
And now I'll type Drag.

197
00:08:27,756 --> 00:08:31,456
Notice that Swift Playgrounds

198
00:08:31,456 --> 00:08:34,056
drag handler from

199
00:08:34,446 --> 00:08:38,236
So I'll tap on that, and we get

200
00:08:38,645 --> 00:08:41,145
If I type Return, it'll

201
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:42,206
so we can do some coding.

202
00:08:43,296 --> 00:08:46,386
Now I want it to create a

203
00:08:46,386 --> 00:08:46,836
my finger.

204
00:08:47,566 --> 00:08:50,706
So all I have to do is what I

205
00:08:51,286 --> 00:08:55,026
So let's tap on the closing

206
00:08:55,026 --> 00:08:58,076
and drag it down to encompass

207
00:08:59,806 --> 00:09:00,966
One more thing I

208
00:08:59,806 --> 00:09:00,966
One more thing I

209
00:09:00,966 --> 00:09:02,456
I have to change the center

210
00:09:02,456 --> 00:09:04,276
of the rectangle to

211
00:09:05,186 --> 00:09:07,036
So let's add that

212
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:11,346
by setting the rectangle's

213
00:09:11,346 --> 00:09:15,816
to the canvas shared

214
00:09:16,326 --> 00:09:18,526
which I know is in array.

215
00:09:19,376 --> 00:09:22,096
If I tap and hold on the H,

216
00:09:22,096 --> 00:09:23,696
it gives me an array's

217
00:09:24,686 --> 00:09:27,486
Now I can tap and hold on the

218
00:09:28,826 --> 00:09:31,506
Now let's dismiss that,

219
00:09:32,236 --> 00:09:35,626
and tap Run My Code,

220
00:09:36,996 --> 00:09:37,596
Yeah.

221
00:09:38,516 --> 00:09:44,546
[ Applause ]

222
00:09:45,046 --> 00:09:47,066
Now I'll tap and hold on

223
00:09:47,626 --> 00:09:48,306
Drag it to the left.

224
00:09:48,306 --> 00:09:48,976
Dismiss the code.

225
00:09:48,976 --> 00:09:50,416
Now I can draw everywhere.

226
00:09:52,106 --> 00:09:53,916
Now, I like my little

227
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:54,886
so I'm going to send it to Matt.

228
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:57,556
So I'm going to tap

229
00:09:57,786 --> 00:10:02,426
You just take a picture to

230
00:09:57,786 --> 00:10:02,426
You just take a picture to

231
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:05,686
Now, a lot was going on here,

232
00:10:06,616 --> 00:10:08,526
and there's a lot

233
00:10:08,806 --> 00:10:10,036
to make a playground

234
00:10:10,436 --> 00:10:11,846
So I'm going to bring

235
00:10:11,966 --> 00:10:16,386
who's going to show us

236
00:10:16,386 --> 00:10:21,546
of the playgrounds in

237
00:10:22,406 --> 00:10:23,376
So, Jonathan.

[ Applause ]

239
00:10:31,116 --> 00:10:33,656
&gt;&gt; Thank you Matt and Max.

240
00:10:33,836 --> 00:10:37,586
So Swift Playgrounds on iPad

241
00:10:37,586 --> 00:10:39,696
Playground documents that

242
00:10:39,696 --> 00:10:41,446
and you can make

243
00:10:42,136 --> 00:10:43,966
You can use AirDrop,

244
00:10:44,126 --> 00:10:47,126
or other document providers

245
00:10:47,126 --> 00:10:48,056
in either environment.

246
00:10:48,056 --> 00:10:49,156
And don't forget to have fun.

247
00:10:49,966 --> 00:10:50,716
But in addition

248
00:10:50,716 --> 00:10:52,866
to the traditional

249
00:10:53,286 --> 00:10:56,366
Swift Playgrounds for iPad

250
00:10:56,366 --> 00:10:58,306
that takes advantage

251
00:10:59,266 --> 00:11:01,996
Playground Books provide

252
00:10:59,266 --> 00:11:01,996
Playground Books provide

253
00:11:01,996 --> 00:11:04,796
to construct an interactive

254
00:11:04,796 --> 00:11:06,756
that you want other

255
00:11:06,756 --> 00:11:07,796
You want to show them something.

256
00:11:08,316 --> 00:11:11,246
So in these next moments, I'd

257
00:11:11,246 --> 00:11:13,596
of what's new, and then

258
00:11:13,596 --> 00:11:15,606
these new things to good use.

259
00:11:16,276 --> 00:11:20,766
So first off, Playground Books

260
00:11:20,766 --> 00:11:23,736
into chapters, and a table

261
00:11:23,736 --> 00:11:25,366
from this for easy navigation.

262
00:11:25,766 --> 00:11:31,756
Playground Books provide a new

263
00:11:32,036 --> 00:11:33,456
and this can be useful

264
00:11:33,456 --> 00:11:36,766
to stage a full-screen

265
00:11:36,766 --> 00:11:38,226
of a story that you're

266
00:11:38,346 --> 00:11:41,236
You can see how our content

267
00:11:41,236 --> 00:11:43,376
trying to demonstrate

268
00:11:43,906 --> 00:11:47,986
And as you introduce concepts,

269
00:11:48,146 --> 00:11:50,226
to link terms with their

270
00:11:50,226 --> 00:11:53,906
of a finger, and all these terms

271
00:11:53,906 --> 00:11:55,996
up to provide a reference

272
00:11:56,646 --> 00:12:01,176
A Playground page full of Swift

273
00:11:56,646 --> 00:12:01,176
A Playground page full of Swift

274
00:12:01,176 --> 00:12:02,396
to just jump into.

275
00:12:02,636 --> 00:12:04,536
Sometimes you don't

276
00:12:04,536 --> 00:12:06,436
from the finer point

277
00:12:06,866 --> 00:12:08,326
So Playground Books

278
00:12:08,326 --> 00:12:11,336
to focus the learner

279
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:14,856
You annotate your Swift

280
00:12:15,456 --> 00:12:17,776
They become blanks that

281
00:12:18,316 --> 00:12:19,806
This lets you reduce

282
00:12:20,006 --> 00:12:21,746
especially at an early

283
00:12:21,746 --> 00:12:23,406
to demonstrate a

284
00:12:23,846 --> 00:12:27,726
And Playground Books

285
00:12:27,726 --> 00:12:29,476
that you don't want

286
00:12:30,326 --> 00:12:33,456
Hidden code blocks give you

287
00:12:33,556 --> 00:12:36,686
and tear down code around some

288
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:39,136
It's a great way to hide

289
00:12:39,136 --> 00:12:40,876
and then you can pull

290
00:12:40,876 --> 00:12:45,696
and expose this setup magic

291
00:12:46,196 --> 00:12:48,546
Playground Books lets you

292
00:12:48,546 --> 00:12:50,196
that show up it the

293
00:12:50,586 --> 00:12:53,806
You can specify or exclude

294
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:56,356
etcetera, customizing what

295
00:12:57,036 --> 00:13:01,316
And with the new

296
00:12:57,036 --> 00:13:01,316
And with the new

297
00:13:01,316 --> 00:13:05,236
you can configure the live

298
00:13:05,236 --> 00:13:06,416
as the page is loaded.

299
00:13:06,836 --> 00:13:10,196
It runs Swift code in a separate

300
00:13:10,196 --> 00:13:12,386
of the code that is typed

301
00:13:12,896 --> 00:13:16,056
This editor code on the left and

302
00:13:16,056 --> 00:13:18,806
they talk to each other with

303
00:13:19,056 --> 00:13:21,926
We're actually going to see how

304
00:13:22,356 --> 00:13:24,226
through my demonstration and so

305
00:13:24,226 --> 00:13:25,296
that you can take

306
00:13:25,526 --> 00:13:28,166
It's a great way to do

307
00:13:28,316 --> 00:13:30,986
building up with each successive

308
00:13:31,726 --> 00:13:36,046
And if you've chosen to

309
00:13:36,046 --> 00:13:38,256
and guide through the

310
00:13:38,656 --> 00:13:41,226
you can analyze what was

311
00:13:41,426 --> 00:13:43,536
that the learner can bring up

312
00:13:44,096 --> 00:13:48,526
And if they succeed in their

313
00:13:48,956 --> 00:13:49,976
with a success message.

314
00:13:51,516 --> 00:13:54,846
And Playground Books will

315
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:57,446
of each page, and the learner

316
00:13:57,446 --> 00:13:58,676
in the table of contents.

317
00:13:59,226 --> 00:14:01,526
Use these Hint and

318
00:13:59,226 --> 00:14:01,526
Use these Hint and

319
00:14:01,526 --> 00:14:02,766
of your own motivational design.

320
00:14:03,336 --> 00:14:07,826
You have access to a

321
00:14:07,826 --> 00:14:09,116
that is kept with the document.

322
00:14:09,556 --> 00:14:12,876
This lets you track preferences

323
00:14:12,876 --> 00:14:17,426
of progress as the learner moves

324
00:14:17,866 --> 00:14:19,676
And Playground Books

325
00:14:20,356 --> 00:14:23,666
Every change made is kept

326
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:25,086
from the main document content.

327
00:14:25,196 --> 00:14:28,706
And if the learner so chooses,

328
00:14:28,816 --> 00:14:32,056
to the state it was when

329
00:14:32,456 --> 00:14:34,446
The entire document

330
00:14:34,886 --> 00:14:36,256
Every page will be pristine.

331
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:37,966
The key/value store

332
00:14:38,156 --> 00:14:39,186
Assessments reset.

333
00:14:39,556 --> 00:14:43,116
And they're ready

334
00:14:43,336 --> 00:14:46,816
And last, but certainly not

335
00:14:46,816 --> 00:14:48,956
you can see the documentation

336
00:14:48,956 --> 00:14:50,756
We want to make sure that

337
00:14:50,756 --> 00:14:53,796
so that you can work on your

338
00:14:53,796 --> 00:14:55,256
workflows to make

339
00:14:55,676 --> 00:14:57,656
Start with the examples

340
00:14:57,656 --> 00:15:00,676
Dig into all that, and even

341
00:14:57,656 --> 00:15:00,676
Dig into all that, and even

342
00:15:00,676 --> 00:15:02,836
produced by our content

343
00:15:05,146 --> 00:15:08,536
There you go.

344
00:15:10,016 --> 00:15:13,356
So now I'd like to

345
00:15:13,356 --> 00:15:16,676
that I have created to show

346
00:15:16,676 --> 00:15:17,886
from an author's perspective.

347
00:15:18,476 --> 00:15:21,136
So my audience for this

348
00:15:21,136 --> 00:15:23,826
for you is someone

349
00:15:23,826 --> 00:15:26,696
and even used Playgrounds

350
00:15:26,696 --> 00:15:29,586
but now they're new to the

351
00:15:29,686 --> 00:15:31,596
and they'd like to know

352
00:15:31,936 --> 00:15:33,676
My goal with this

353
00:15:33,676 --> 00:15:37,276
to build a living reference

354
00:15:37,276 --> 00:15:40,546
always-on live view works

355
00:15:40,686 --> 00:15:42,056
So let's get started.

356
00:15:42,266 --> 00:15:46,456
What better way to

357
00:15:46,456 --> 00:15:48,916
of Playground Books than

358
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:50,886
that demonstrates the new

359
00:15:53,256 --> 00:15:55,276
We're very self-referential

360
00:15:55,276 --> 00:15:55,856
All right.

361
00:15:55,856 --> 00:15:57,956
So let's get started.

362
00:15:57,956 --> 00:15:59,486
Now we have here the

363
00:15:59,486 --> 00:16:01,776
I'm going to bring up my

364
00:15:59,486 --> 00:16:01,776
I'm going to bring up my

365
00:16:01,776 --> 00:16:03,126
to the Live View"

366
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:07,206
And you can see immediately

367
00:16:07,606 --> 00:16:08,376
Notice that the code

368
00:16:08,376 --> 00:16:11,096
on the editor has not even been

369
00:16:11,096 --> 00:16:13,186
at all, yet we have

370
00:16:13,186 --> 00:16:14,136
with the code I've written

371
00:16:14,136 --> 00:16:17,466
for the always-on live view

372
00:16:17,466 --> 00:16:17,996
face here.

373
00:16:18,316 --> 00:16:19,246
I'd like you to meet Em.

374
00:16:19,936 --> 00:16:22,476
My helper here is a

375
00:16:22,476 --> 00:16:24,096
to recognize knock, knock jokes.

376
00:16:25,296 --> 00:16:27,686
So we can see here on

377
00:16:27,996 --> 00:16:30,096
our goal is to just play around.

378
00:16:30,526 --> 00:16:32,866
I don't want to burden the

379
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:35,476
of how we're actually

380
00:16:35,476 --> 00:16:36,426
over to the live view.

381
00:16:36,426 --> 00:16:38,486
I just want you to

382
00:16:38,776 --> 00:16:40,796
with this fun little

383
00:16:41,236 --> 00:16:42,536
What we're going to

384
00:16:42,536 --> 00:16:45,756
to send messages using this

385
00:16:46,576 --> 00:16:48,686
These strings will be passed

386
00:16:48,686 --> 00:16:51,186
and they'll advance the

387
00:16:51,186 --> 00:16:53,956
that is running for Em

388
00:16:53,956 --> 00:16:55,626
as the jokes continue.

389
00:16:55,626 --> 00:16:56,306
So we'll start here.

390
00:16:56,406 --> 00:16:57,526
We have a string already filled

391
00:16:57,526 --> 00:16:58,746
out for us called

392
00:16:58,746 --> 00:17:02,636
I'll just tap Run My Code, and

393
00:16:58,746 --> 00:17:02,636
I'll just tap Run My Code, and

394
00:17:02,846 --> 00:17:05,286
The code on the left

395
00:17:05,596 --> 00:17:08,586
The special magic happened

396
00:17:08,586 --> 00:17:10,175
and the string was

397
00:17:10,175 --> 00:17:12,165
And we'll brush away the

398
00:17:12,506 --> 00:17:13,766
So let's continue.

399
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:16,296
I'm going to say, "Boo."

400
00:17:16,296 --> 00:17:18,266
And I'm using the

401
00:17:18,266 --> 00:17:19,886
because I don't want

402
00:17:19,945 --> 00:17:21,056
with the on-screen keyboard.

403
00:17:21,596 --> 00:17:23,925
I will send this string

404
00:17:24,806 --> 00:17:25,695
"Boo! Who?"

405
00:17:27,486 --> 00:17:28,876
"Are you crying?"

406
00:17:30,576 --> 00:17:31,496
Tap Run My Code.

407
00:17:32,516 --> 00:17:36,866
[ Laughter ]

408
00:17:37,366 --> 00:17:39,396
And Em has correctly

409
00:17:39,396 --> 00:17:40,696
knock joke as a classic.

410
00:17:40,696 --> 00:17:43,056
Let's try one more to see

411
00:17:43,056 --> 00:17:45,706
I need to restart Em's

412
00:17:45,706 --> 00:17:47,656
So I'm going to start by

413
00:17:47,896 --> 00:17:51,306
I'll tap Run My Code to compile

414
00:17:51,306 --> 00:17:52,696
over the wire to the other side.

415
00:17:53,276 --> 00:17:53,856
"Who's there?"

416
00:17:54,696 --> 00:17:57,856
UInt, which is Swift's

417
00:17:59,656 --> 00:18:00,396
"UInt who?"

418
00:17:59,656 --> 00:18:00,396
"UInt who?"

419
00:18:01,536 --> 00:18:04,706
"UInterested in my

420
00:18:05,516 --> 00:18:12,596
[ Laughter ]

421
00:18:13,096 --> 00:18:15,176
That sounds like some

422
00:18:15,176 --> 00:18:16,186
on this assessment here.

423
00:18:16,986 --> 00:18:17,626
That's unfortunate.

424
00:18:17,976 --> 00:18:22,936
But what we have here is a way

425
00:18:22,936 --> 00:18:25,426
And when you're ready, you

426
00:18:25,426 --> 00:18:28,256
where the magic dust

427
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:30,946
and you can see exactly how

428
00:18:30,946 --> 00:18:32,716
This is all it takes

429
00:18:32,716 --> 00:18:36,156
over to the live view process,

430
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:36,866
in a few minutes here.

431
00:18:37,626 --> 00:18:39,606
But here, what we have

432
00:18:39,606 --> 00:18:42,996
that progressively explores

433
00:18:43,256 --> 00:18:44,636
from the author's perspective.

434
00:18:44,986 --> 00:18:47,396
You can continue on to further

435
00:18:47,396 --> 00:18:50,216
to send more complex

436
00:18:50,386 --> 00:18:52,596
You can configure it

437
00:18:52,596 --> 00:18:53,926
and punch line joke patterns.

438
00:18:54,206 --> 00:18:57,056
You can even save these joke

439
00:18:57,436 --> 00:18:59,536
to load them when you

440
00:18:59,776 --> 00:19:01,456
after the next time you

441
00:18:59,776 --> 00:19:01,456
after the next time you

442
00:19:02,346 --> 00:19:05,956
So this Playground Book

443
00:19:06,056 --> 00:19:07,286
with our session materials.

444
00:19:07,286 --> 00:19:09,016
I encourage you to check

445
00:19:09,016 --> 00:19:11,166
But right now, we're going

446
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:19,626
and see how this thing works

447
00:19:20,536 --> 00:19:24,246
So Playground Books are a

448
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:27,446
towards teaching these

449
00:19:27,786 --> 00:19:28,706
that we have on the iPad.

450
00:19:29,906 --> 00:19:32,546
They're a folder with the

451
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:35,816
that is treated as a document

452
00:19:36,186 --> 00:19:39,646
You edit these on your Mac with

453
00:19:39,646 --> 00:19:41,336
You can use Xcode, your

454
00:19:41,676 --> 00:19:43,416
Use your version control system,

455
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:46,256
build your own custom

456
00:19:46,256 --> 00:19:47,186
if you need to, to be able

457
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,336
to produce content

458
00:19:50,376 --> 00:19:52,136
And we're going to walk

459
00:19:52,136 --> 00:19:52,996
assembled together.

460
00:19:53,356 --> 00:19:55,536
The package contains

461
00:19:55,536 --> 00:19:57,966
and Swift code assets

462
00:19:57,966 --> 00:19:58,906
that make everything work.

463
00:20:00,446 --> 00:20:02,076
And here's an overview

464
00:20:02,206 --> 00:20:04,676
We're going to refer back to

465
00:20:04,676 --> 00:20:06,466
of see how everything

466
00:20:07,646 --> 00:20:09,586
At the very root of

467
00:20:09,586 --> 00:20:11,146
you have a folder

468
00:20:11,146 --> 00:20:12,786
and as you would guess, this is

469
00:20:12,786 --> 00:20:15,026
where you put your

470
00:20:16,146 --> 00:20:18,656
Moving inside, you will

471
00:20:18,656 --> 00:20:20,326
if you've authored

472
00:20:20,966 --> 00:20:23,846
Sources is where you put the

473
00:20:23,846 --> 00:20:26,306
to have compiled and made

474
00:20:26,336 --> 00:20:27,416
in your Playground Book.

475
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:30,466
You don't even have to import

476
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:33,166
Anything that's declared as

477
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:34,426
as soon as you open the page.

478
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:40,766
And then Resources holds the

479
00:20:40,986 --> 00:20:43,366
Place your images, your

480
00:20:43,366 --> 00:20:44,926
that you need to

481
00:20:45,246 --> 00:20:46,716
and they'd be pulled

482
00:20:47,376 --> 00:20:50,276
Note that these two folders

483
00:20:50,346 --> 00:20:52,706
of this document

484
00:20:52,706 --> 00:20:55,946
in them is made available to

485
00:20:56,396 --> 00:20:59,356
If you choose to, you can

486
00:20:59,476 --> 00:21:01,756
by putting a Sources and

487
00:20:59,476 --> 00:21:01,756
by putting a Sources and

488
00:21:02,126 --> 00:21:03,506
or even individual pages.

489
00:21:03,506 --> 00:21:04,836
You don't have to

490
00:21:04,836 --> 00:21:05,886
across every other page.

491
00:21:05,886 --> 00:21:06,486
It's up to you.

492
00:21:06,786 --> 00:21:08,156
Customization there,

493
00:21:08,736 --> 00:21:12,086
The next folder we're visiting

494
00:21:12,216 --> 00:21:14,806
and as you would expect,

495
00:21:15,126 --> 00:21:18,726
which are themselves folders

496
00:21:19,346 --> 00:21:24,346
and each page is a folder

497
00:21:24,346 --> 00:21:27,266
that you interact with when

498
00:21:27,266 --> 00:21:28,676
in the app.

499
00:21:28,676 --> 00:21:29,806
This first file we're going

500
00:21:29,806 --> 00:21:32,416
to see here is called

501
00:21:32,846 --> 00:21:34,936
It's a special configuration

502
00:21:34,996 --> 00:21:36,586
up how the page will work.

503
00:21:36,986 --> 00:21:39,326
If you open this file, it

504
00:21:39,636 --> 00:21:40,516
We'll go through

505
00:21:41,316 --> 00:21:44,506
Now, manifest files are property

506
00:21:44,506 --> 00:21:47,786
and values that Swift Playground

507
00:21:47,786 --> 00:21:49,456
with a document is

508
00:21:50,056 --> 00:21:52,226
These manifest files

509
00:21:52,636 --> 00:21:55,066
and the document level as

510
00:21:55,106 --> 00:21:57,406
like the order of things

511
00:21:57,856 --> 00:22:00,046
We're just going to focus

512
00:21:57,856 --> 00:22:00,046
We're just going to focus

513
00:22:00,046 --> 00:22:03,066
because it has the most

514
00:22:03,066 --> 00:22:04,886
in the demonstration,

515
00:22:04,886 --> 00:22:08,036
of these configuration

516
00:22:08,036 --> 00:22:08,676
on the page.

517
00:22:10,026 --> 00:22:14,646
The first key in the property

518
00:22:15,016 --> 00:22:18,066
It sets the name at the top of

519
00:22:18,066 --> 00:22:19,806
in the table of contents.

520
00:22:21,056 --> 00:22:24,946
The next key, LiveViewMode,

521
00:22:24,946 --> 00:22:26,196
when the page is first opened.

522
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:30,166
Usually, the live view is

523
00:22:30,166 --> 00:22:32,466
in code or the learner

524
00:22:32,706 --> 00:22:35,316
In this case, I want it to show

525
00:22:35,636 --> 00:22:38,396
So by setting the string

526
00:22:38,396 --> 00:22:41,286
by default, I get

527
00:22:42,436 --> 00:22:47,576
PosterReference is a key that

528
00:22:47,576 --> 00:22:49,606
up a file name in the

529
00:22:50,476 --> 00:22:53,056
That file becomes a

530
00:22:53,056 --> 00:22:56,596
up the live view area before

531
00:22:56,596 --> 00:22:59,016
chance to run right

532
00:22:59,326 --> 00:23:02,376
And as you can see here, as soon

533
00:22:59,326 --> 00:23:02,376
And as you can see here, as soon

534
00:23:02,376 --> 00:23:04,576
to run, the poster

535
00:23:05,286 --> 00:23:08,126
and we can see the live

536
00:23:08,896 --> 00:23:12,766
The LiveViewEdgetoEdge

537
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:15,976
that determines whether

538
00:23:15,976 --> 00:23:19,086
of the live view extends

539
00:23:19,086 --> 00:23:21,526
of the viewport, and also

540
00:23:21,526 --> 00:23:22,586
button, as you see here.

541
00:23:22,586 --> 00:23:25,376
I wanted to that in my

542
00:23:25,656 --> 00:23:29,046
If you set LiveViewEdgetoEdge

543
00:23:29,046 --> 00:23:31,056
and you gave the live

544
00:23:31,156 --> 00:23:32,076
this is what you'd see.

545
00:23:32,556 --> 00:23:34,956
Note how it's inset

546
00:23:35,486 --> 00:23:37,486
It's not covered up by

547
00:23:37,726 --> 00:23:40,456
It's up to you which

548
00:23:40,456 --> 00:23:41,996
depending on the

549
00:23:42,496 --> 00:23:44,876
For instance, if you

550
00:23:44,876 --> 00:23:47,216
that had full control

551
00:23:47,216 --> 00:23:49,386
then setting LiveViewEdgetoEdge

552
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:53,146
to No would give

553
00:23:53,726 --> 00:23:57,136
Playground logging mode controls

554
00:23:57,136 --> 00:23:59,006
on the right side of every line

555
00:23:59,006 --> 00:24:00,486
in the editor that

556
00:23:59,006 --> 00:24:00,486
in the editor that

557
00:24:01,196 --> 00:24:04,736
In my case, my live view does

558
00:24:04,736 --> 00:24:05,266
that I need.

559
00:24:05,266 --> 00:24:07,736
So I decided to set the

560
00:24:07,736 --> 00:24:09,026
to the string value Off,

561
00:24:09,376 --> 00:24:11,636
which turns off the

562
00:24:11,716 --> 00:24:16,106
Now we've reached

563
00:24:16,106 --> 00:24:17,456
of the Playground

564
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:20,096
This is where all

565
00:24:20,516 --> 00:24:24,026
Let's take a look at this first

566
00:24:24,756 --> 00:24:29,126
Now, all of you have interacted

567
00:24:29,826 --> 00:24:32,386
Whether it's full screen

568
00:24:32,576 --> 00:24:33,936
of the live view, as seen here,

569
00:24:34,506 --> 00:24:37,986
whatever is in the editor

570
00:24:37,986 --> 00:24:40,966
And when you tap the Run

571
00:24:40,966 --> 00:24:43,276
and everything it

572
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:46,126
In my introduction page,

573
00:24:46,396 --> 00:24:48,566
Contents.swift looks

574
00:24:48,976 --> 00:24:51,836
At the top is Playground

575
00:24:51,836 --> 00:24:53,426
to help describe

576
00:24:53,426 --> 00:24:56,766
Your objectives, goals,

577
00:24:56,766 --> 00:24:58,326
by the person going

578
00:24:58,596 --> 00:25:00,246
to understand how they're

579
00:24:58,596 --> 00:25:00,246
to understand how they're

580
00:25:01,356 --> 00:25:03,206
Those of you who've authored

581
00:25:03,206 --> 00:25:03,926
recognize this.

582
00:25:04,196 --> 00:25:06,596
It's the standard

583
00:25:07,196 --> 00:25:10,776
And here, I have a few lines

584
00:25:10,776 --> 00:25:13,456
up the page so that the real

585
00:25:14,096 --> 00:25:15,606
but I don't want this

586
00:25:15,606 --> 00:25:16,846
at least not on this page.

587
00:25:17,466 --> 00:25:20,376
So I use these special magic

588
00:25:20,376 --> 00:25:21,766
and end of a hidden code block.

589
00:25:22,306 --> 00:25:24,586
Everything between these

590
00:25:25,216 --> 00:25:27,356
It's executed along

591
00:25:27,676 --> 00:25:30,076
but it is not visible

592
00:25:30,116 --> 00:25:31,666
in Swift Playgrounds on iPad.

593
00:25:33,506 --> 00:25:35,896
And the real work of the

594
00:25:35,896 --> 00:25:38,316
with this statement, a

595
00:25:38,316 --> 00:25:40,036
that was written above

596
00:25:40,646 --> 00:25:43,706
Now I wanted to ensure that

597
00:25:43,706 --> 00:25:45,436
down with this page

598
00:25:45,436 --> 00:25:46,876
into this function parameter

599
00:25:47,176 --> 00:25:49,086
that they wouldn't accidentally

600
00:25:49,816 --> 00:25:53,176
So I'm using editable code

601
00:25:53,176 --> 00:25:55,836
up with these special magic

602
00:25:55,836 --> 00:25:57,956
and ending of an

603
00:25:58,346 --> 00:26:00,226
and they can only

604
00:25:58,346 --> 00:26:00,226
and they can only

605
00:26:01,026 --> 00:26:03,176
You can have as many of these

606
00:26:03,576 --> 00:26:05,106
And the first time

607
00:26:05,346 --> 00:26:08,196
only these areas can be

608
00:26:08,196 --> 00:26:10,496
for what I need, and the

609
00:26:10,496 --> 00:26:11,926
and they're just

610
00:26:12,476 --> 00:26:16,206
And experienced Playground

611
00:26:16,206 --> 00:26:17,126
placeholder syntax.

612
00:26:17,556 --> 00:26:21,066
These angle brackets and

613
00:26:21,066 --> 00:26:22,326
to show up in the editor.

614
00:26:22,886 --> 00:26:24,846
The learner can tap on the

615
00:26:24,846 --> 00:26:26,686
as they start typing,

616
00:26:26,686 --> 00:26:27,556
with whatever they wanted.

617
00:26:27,976 --> 00:26:29,946
This is a great way to give

618
00:26:29,946 --> 00:26:31,786
to go in a certain spot.

619
00:26:33,296 --> 00:26:36,846
So that's a good summary of what

620
00:26:37,236 --> 00:26:39,146
a quick summary on

621
00:26:39,146 --> 00:26:40,876
But now we're going

622
00:26:40,876 --> 00:26:43,116
over to the right-hand

623
00:26:43,116 --> 00:26:45,486
on in the always-on live view.

624
00:26:47,096 --> 00:26:51,096
This introduction page has

625
00:26:52,626 --> 00:26:53,676
This is what it looks like.

626
00:26:54,406 --> 00:26:56,556
First we import

627
00:26:56,956 --> 00:26:59,216
Now, those of you who've

628
00:26:59,216 --> 00:27:02,426
familiar with XE Playground, the

629
00:26:59,216 --> 00:27:02,426
familiar with XE Playground, the

630
00:27:02,426 --> 00:27:03,656
to the page environment.

631
00:27:04,106 --> 00:27:04,876
That's been renamed.

632
00:27:04,966 --> 00:27:06,086
It's been new and improved.

633
00:27:06,086 --> 00:27:07,576
It's called Playground Support,

634
00:27:07,576 --> 00:27:09,046
and this is what you

635
00:27:10,666 --> 00:27:13,246
So we ask, for the

636
00:27:13,766 --> 00:27:18,506
and then we set the live

637
00:27:18,506 --> 00:27:22,136
to be a fresh instance of this

638
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:24,596
Where did this

639
00:27:25,156 --> 00:27:26,886
Well, it's part of

640
00:27:26,886 --> 00:27:29,366
in the Sources directory at

641
00:27:29,876 --> 00:27:32,696
This is the library of code

642
00:27:32,696 --> 00:27:34,496
to share across all the pages.

643
00:27:34,766 --> 00:27:36,746
Anything I put in here,

644
00:27:36,746 --> 00:27:37,716
as it's marked as public.

645
00:27:39,266 --> 00:27:41,026
Now, you could, if you want to,

646
00:27:41,126 --> 00:27:45,456
write all of your live view code

647
00:27:45,456 --> 00:27:46,936
There's nothing stopping

648
00:27:47,466 --> 00:27:49,556
But then you have

649
00:27:49,556 --> 00:27:51,836
to any other Playground

650
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:53,666
to share the same

651
00:27:53,976 --> 00:27:56,006
Every page in my Playground

652
00:27:56,306 --> 00:27:58,946
so I'm just using these

653
00:27:58,946 --> 00:28:01,496
setup that make the

654
00:27:58,946 --> 00:28:01,496
setup that make the

655
00:28:01,636 --> 00:28:03,556
make the always-on

656
00:28:03,556 --> 00:28:05,256
They're all sharing

657
00:28:05,256 --> 00:28:06,786
and I just have to

658
00:28:07,006 --> 00:28:09,546
across to any other page

659
00:28:10,596 --> 00:28:13,466
Those of you who've authored

660
00:28:13,466 --> 00:28:15,856
like you're looking at something

661
00:28:16,416 --> 00:28:18,336
Isn't this how you would

662
00:28:18,336 --> 00:28:20,676
if you were doing it from

663
00:28:21,816 --> 00:28:24,416
Yes, it is, and you can

664
00:28:24,836 --> 00:28:27,926
If you choose to, it runs

665
00:28:28,606 --> 00:28:30,946
where all the code in the

666
00:28:31,116 --> 00:28:33,846
That is really useful,

667
00:28:33,846 --> 00:28:35,376
to the live view object.

668
00:28:35,626 --> 00:28:39,596
You can take page.liveview,

669
00:28:39,796 --> 00:28:41,306
and manipulate it

670
00:28:41,496 --> 00:28:43,186
Call methods on it,

671
00:28:43,186 --> 00:28:44,836
It's right there

672
00:28:45,756 --> 00:28:48,246
But that means that the live

673
00:28:48,246 --> 00:28:50,086
as the code in the

674
00:28:50,456 --> 00:28:53,596
It will not start until the

675
00:28:53,596 --> 00:28:56,936
It will stop as soon as

676
00:28:56,936 --> 00:28:58,536
or starts typing

677
00:28:58,916 --> 00:29:02,366
And it can't run if there's

678
00:28:58,916 --> 00:29:02,366
And it can't run if there's

679
00:29:02,506 --> 00:29:04,226
that is currently being

680
00:29:05,116 --> 00:29:09,546
So that is where the

681
00:29:09,746 --> 00:29:11,636
and LiveView.swift comes in.

682
00:29:11,636 --> 00:29:15,146
If this file -- if a file with

683
00:29:15,146 --> 00:29:16,646
in your Playground Book page,

684
00:29:17,166 --> 00:29:19,736
you automatically have

685
00:29:20,006 --> 00:29:22,486
This file is executed as

686
00:29:22,966 --> 00:29:25,026
and that makes it run

687
00:29:25,026 --> 00:29:28,216
which is awesome, because that

688
00:29:29,636 --> 00:29:32,456
Even if the code in the editor

689
00:29:33,316 --> 00:29:36,746
The trade-off is that you

690
00:29:36,746 --> 00:29:39,056
to an instance of

691
00:29:39,056 --> 00:29:40,326
to it like you were

692
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:43,606
You have to use some sort

693
00:29:43,606 --> 00:29:46,026
to send messages back and

694
00:29:46,026 --> 00:29:48,416
to look into that next here.

695
00:29:48,656 --> 00:29:50,956
Say we have this code

696
00:29:51,406 --> 00:29:54,036
from Contents.swift,

697
00:29:54,036 --> 00:29:55,126
of the code running

698
00:29:56,586 --> 00:29:58,576
We want to send the

699
00:29:58,576 --> 00:29:59,686
knock" to the other side.

700
00:29:59,686 --> 00:30:01,836
So first thing we do is

701
00:29:59,686 --> 00:30:01,836
So first thing we do is

702
00:30:02,656 --> 00:30:04,296
We get access to

703
00:30:04,846 --> 00:30:07,596
And when we ask for the

704
00:30:07,716 --> 00:30:10,176
we don't cast it to

705
00:30:10,616 --> 00:30:12,356
We cast it to this

706
00:30:12,356 --> 00:30:14,346
PlaygroundRemoteLiveViewProxy.

707
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:17,436
The instance of this class

708
00:30:17,886 --> 00:30:20,896
to hand things across the wire

709
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:23,666
And if this conditional

710
00:30:23,946 --> 00:30:26,646
then that is your queue

711
00:30:26,646 --> 00:30:29,746
in the main process that you

712
00:30:29,796 --> 00:30:30,536
for this page.

713
00:30:30,746 --> 00:30:31,756
Use this as that signal.

714
00:30:32,406 --> 00:30:34,906
So assuming this all

715
00:30:34,946 --> 00:30:37,596
We actually have a live view

716
00:30:38,516 --> 00:30:39,496
We craft a message.

717
00:30:40,876 --> 00:30:43,606
The message-sending mechanism

718
00:30:43,606 --> 00:30:46,826
an enum that we'll kind of talk

719
00:30:47,086 --> 00:30:49,256
But as you can probably guess

720
00:30:49,256 --> 00:30:52,876
we're casting a string case with

721
00:30:52,876 --> 00:30:55,326
"knock, knock," and then

722
00:30:55,326 --> 00:30:57,216
and hand it over to the proxy,

723
00:30:57,736 --> 00:30:59,666
calling the send

724
00:31:00,246 --> 00:31:05,376
So the Contents.swift code

725
00:31:05,376 --> 00:31:09,776
over to the live view proxy, and

726
00:31:09,776 --> 00:31:14,106
that over to something

727
00:31:14,266 --> 00:31:16,136
We need to wire up

728
00:31:16,136 --> 00:31:19,366
so we can receive this message.

729
00:31:19,696 --> 00:31:21,396
Somewhere in our

730
00:31:22,146 --> 00:31:24,116
we've extended the

731
00:31:24,236 --> 00:31:25,956
and we've said that

732
00:31:25,956 --> 00:31:28,396
to the

733
00:31:28,396 --> 00:31:28,956
protocol.

734
00:31:29,366 --> 00:31:31,906
That means we must

735
00:31:32,166 --> 00:31:33,376
that takes a PlaygroundValue.

736
00:31:33,946 --> 00:31:38,516
This will be called, because

737
00:31:38,516 --> 00:31:40,686
live view, because

738
00:31:40,686 --> 00:31:42,506
to the page.liveview property.

739
00:31:42,796 --> 00:31:45,556
That's what the live view

740
00:31:45,976 --> 00:31:47,696
that this thing needs

741
00:31:48,836 --> 00:31:51,786
Inside this message, we

742
00:31:51,786 --> 00:31:53,946
and check to see

743
00:31:53,946 --> 00:31:55,416
extracting any associated

744
00:31:55,776 --> 00:31:58,166
I only care about strings right

745
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:02,256
if case let syntax, and then

746
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:02,256
if case let syntax, and then

747
00:32:02,496 --> 00:32:05,316
the value of this enum is

748
00:32:06,136 --> 00:32:08,356
And now, inside the if

749
00:32:08,916 --> 00:32:09,866
Do something with it.

750
00:32:10,216 --> 00:32:11,816
And in this case, we pass it off

751
00:32:11,816 --> 00:32:14,066
to this function

752
00:32:14,436 --> 00:32:16,976
that then advances Em's

753
00:32:17,546 --> 00:32:21,926
So what if we want to

754
00:32:21,926 --> 00:32:22,876
from the live view?

755
00:32:23,186 --> 00:32:25,286
Say we set up something

756
00:32:25,286 --> 00:32:27,586
and we get the string

757
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:31,156
How do we do that?

758
00:32:31,506 --> 00:32:34,036
Well first, in the live view

759
00:32:34,036 --> 00:32:36,486
that actually triggers the

760
00:32:36,836 --> 00:32:39,766
to have a tap gesture

761
00:32:39,836 --> 00:32:41,816
that will call us back

762
00:32:42,456 --> 00:32:43,676
Once you tap on the face,

763
00:32:43,676 --> 00:32:47,866
we craft the PlaygroundValue

764
00:32:47,866 --> 00:32:51,876
with the associated literal

765
00:32:52,006 --> 00:32:55,996
on self, passing this

766
00:32:55,996 --> 00:32:57,716
Now, where did the

767
00:32:58,326 --> 00:33:00,846
Well, by declaring

768
00:32:58,326 --> 00:33:00,846
Well, by declaring

769
00:33:00,846 --> 00:33:02,846
to this

770
00:33:02,846 --> 00:33:05,016
protocol, it was

771
00:33:05,016 --> 00:33:06,536
as a convenience, automatically.

772
00:33:07,366 --> 00:33:09,516
Send is defined in

773
00:33:09,586 --> 00:33:10,996
with a default implementation,

774
00:33:10,996 --> 00:33:14,966
and because this class is

775
00:33:14,966 --> 00:33:17,676
like this will just pass it

776
00:33:17,886 --> 00:33:21,946
and it will make its way over

777
00:33:22,496 --> 00:33:23,576
You tap on the face.

778
00:33:24,266 --> 00:33:26,796
"Hello" is crafted, sent

779
00:33:27,626 --> 00:33:30,276
and now then live view

780
00:33:30,276 --> 00:33:33,216
that to something

781
00:33:33,736 --> 00:33:35,326
Let's see how we could

782
00:33:36,426 --> 00:33:39,906
There's a bit of set up we

783
00:33:40,236 --> 00:33:41,276
code that you write

784
00:33:41,276 --> 00:33:43,936
in Contents.swift will

785
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:45,416
as it reaches the

786
00:33:45,736 --> 00:33:47,566
That's not what we

787
00:33:47,946 --> 00:33:50,936
We're waiting for some sort of

788
00:33:50,936 --> 00:33:52,216
at some later point in time,

789
00:33:52,616 --> 00:33:54,836
so we need to first grab

790
00:33:54,886 --> 00:33:57,366
and then tell it that

791
00:33:57,836 --> 00:33:59,796
by setting the

792
00:33:59,796 --> 00:34:00,676
property to true.

793
00:33:59,796 --> 00:34:00,676
property to true.

794
00:34:02,166 --> 00:34:04,716
We asked for the live view

795
00:34:05,136 --> 00:34:07,016
and now we need to have

796
00:34:07,016 --> 00:34:09,946
as the delegate of that proxy

797
00:34:09,985 --> 00:34:11,835
I'm just going to make

798
00:34:12,166 --> 00:34:13,565
A class right in line.

799
00:34:14,525 --> 00:34:15,516
Notice that it conforms

800
00:34:15,516 --> 00:34:18,366
to the PlaygroundRemote

801
00:34:18,616 --> 00:34:21,596
which means I have to implement

802
00:34:21,596 --> 00:34:22,456
received method.

803
00:34:23,286 --> 00:34:23,876
And that's it.

804
00:34:24,255 --> 00:34:26,456
This will be called

805
00:34:26,456 --> 00:34:30,376
with the Playground value that

806
00:34:30,376 --> 00:34:31,596
if case let statement,

807
00:34:32,005 --> 00:34:34,166
and inside we do

808
00:34:35,826 --> 00:34:37,696
That defines the delegate.

809
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:38,726
Now we have to wire it up.

810
00:34:38,936 --> 00:34:41,056
So we'll instantiate

811
00:34:41,436 --> 00:34:44,036
to the proxy's delegate

812
00:34:44,496 --> 00:34:45,676
and that completes the circle.

813
00:34:46,446 --> 00:34:48,286
So now we have the

814
00:34:48,496 --> 00:34:49,525
You tap on the face.

815
00:34:49,846 --> 00:34:52,466
"Hello" is wrapped up

816
00:34:52,466 --> 00:34:55,516
passed into the live view

817
00:34:55,556 --> 00:34:58,176
to the delegate, that

818
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:01,336
and it receives the message, and

819
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:01,336
and it receives the message, and

820
00:35:02,056 --> 00:35:07,416
I want to quickly point out this

821
00:35:07,416 --> 00:35:11,066
lot of options to statically

822
00:35:11,066 --> 00:35:12,976
that we want to be able

823
00:35:13,006 --> 00:35:14,346
between these two processes.

824
00:35:14,996 --> 00:35:17,736
You can use these enum cases

825
00:35:17,846 --> 00:35:18,796
in the last few slides.

826
00:35:19,326 --> 00:35:21,536
Or you can define

827
00:35:21,956 --> 00:35:25,896
into Playground values from

828
00:35:26,346 --> 00:35:30,416
As an added bonus, the key

829
00:35:30,416 --> 00:35:31,236
values too.

830
00:35:31,236 --> 00:35:34,356
So the work done to get

831
00:35:34,356 --> 00:35:38,066
of this model can be used both

832
00:35:38,476 --> 00:35:40,006
and for saving statement.

833
00:35:41,576 --> 00:35:45,976
So remember, Contents.swift

834
00:35:45,976 --> 00:35:47,346
on the left-hand side.

835
00:35:47,346 --> 00:35:49,306
It's what we call

836
00:35:49,906 --> 00:35:52,776
And if you have a

837
00:35:52,776 --> 00:35:56,136
in your Playground Book page,

838
00:35:56,136 --> 00:35:58,776
in the separate always-on

839
00:35:59,116 --> 00:36:01,146
in the process you

840
00:35:59,116 --> 00:36:01,146
in the process you

841
00:36:01,146 --> 00:36:04,586
It's a different mechanism that

842
00:36:04,586 --> 00:36:07,096
into our reference

843
00:36:07,096 --> 00:36:08,126
to see how this thing works

844
00:36:08,126 --> 00:36:12,116
so you can take advantage

845
00:36:12,116 --> 00:36:13,996
Before we reach the

846
00:36:13,996 --> 00:36:16,506
about authoring Playground

847
00:36:16,506 --> 00:36:18,916
out one last detail

848
00:36:18,946 --> 00:36:20,676
as an author of content.

849
00:36:21,386 --> 00:36:24,946
When you play with your

850
00:36:25,476 --> 00:36:27,936
and then you sync it back to

851
00:36:27,936 --> 00:36:31,206
you'll notice at the top

852
00:36:31,206 --> 00:36:32,886
up at the sibling

853
00:36:33,446 --> 00:36:35,646
This is where all

854
00:36:35,756 --> 00:36:37,316
into the editor are stored.

855
00:36:37,586 --> 00:36:41,056
So don't be shocked when you

856
00:36:41,056 --> 00:36:44,126
on your iPad, typing furiously

857
00:36:44,126 --> 00:36:47,026
in the editor, and you think

858
00:36:47,026 --> 00:36:49,036
but when you bring it back

859
00:36:49,486 --> 00:36:51,556
the Contents.swift

860
00:36:51,556 --> 00:36:52,646
like you authored it before.

861
00:36:52,646 --> 00:36:54,036
Where's all the changes

862
00:36:54,526 --> 00:36:55,686
That's by design.

863
00:36:56,846 --> 00:36:59,206
The authored content

864
00:36:59,306 --> 00:37:00,756
by Swift Playgrounds

865
00:36:59,306 --> 00:37:00,756
by Swift Playgrounds

866
00:37:01,676 --> 00:37:04,176
Swift Playgrounds stores a

867
00:37:04,176 --> 00:37:06,556
in this Edits folder, and

868
00:37:06,996 --> 00:37:08,886
and this keeps the

869
00:37:08,886 --> 00:37:11,066
and it's how the Playground

870
00:37:11,686 --> 00:37:17,036
So that is a very

871
00:37:17,266 --> 00:37:19,286
a subset of the underlying

872
00:37:19,286 --> 00:37:21,216
up the new Playground

873
00:37:21,646 --> 00:37:24,676
As mentioned, please go

874
00:37:25,196 --> 00:37:26,896
grab the reference

875
00:37:26,896 --> 00:37:29,426
the examples we have, take apart

876
00:37:29,426 --> 00:37:30,366
by our content team.

877
00:37:30,366 --> 00:37:31,216
It's all there, and we want

878
00:37:31,216 --> 00:37:33,576
to make sure you have

879
00:37:33,576 --> 00:37:34,826
to make awesome stuff.

880
00:37:36,086 --> 00:37:39,606
Now I've led you through

881
00:37:39,606 --> 00:37:42,306
that an author has when they're

882
00:37:42,986 --> 00:37:46,176
But as you'd expect, this app

883
00:37:46,176 --> 00:37:48,356
with on your own as

884
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:49,336
It's great stuff.

885
00:37:49,966 --> 00:37:53,216
And next, I'd like to invite

886
00:37:53,216 --> 00:37:54,836
of the things that

887
00:37:54,836 --> 00:37:56,026
with Swift Playgrounds.

888
00:37:56,406 --> 00:37:56,706
Izzy.

889
00:37:57,061 --> 00:37:59,061
[ Applause ]

890
00:37:59,106 --> 00:37:59,896
Thank you Jonathan.

891
00:38:02,596 --> 00:38:03,256
Thank you Jonathan.

892
00:38:03,306 --> 00:38:03,836
That was awesome.

893
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:07,876
Now, we're going to jump

894
00:38:11,976 --> 00:38:16,036
So like all of you, I've

895
00:38:16,036 --> 00:38:17,066
of the features and

896
00:38:17,066 --> 00:38:18,856
that have been announced

897
00:38:19,506 --> 00:38:23,436
And in particular,

898
00:38:23,436 --> 00:38:26,116
that I was really interested

899
00:38:26,116 --> 00:38:27,806
is procedural content

900
00:38:28,116 --> 00:38:30,696
The idea that a computer can

901
00:38:30,696 --> 00:38:33,876
like a real world is

902
00:38:34,156 --> 00:38:37,516
So when I saw that GameKit

903
00:38:37,516 --> 00:38:40,596
I wanted to jump right in and

904
00:38:40,996 --> 00:38:45,076
I wasn't quite sure what

905
00:38:45,936 --> 00:38:48,026
at the new APIs, and I saw

906
00:38:48,026 --> 00:38:50,726
that they added this function

907
00:38:50,786 --> 00:38:52,606
and we have help in the app

908
00:38:52,726 --> 00:38:54,826
that shows us all of

909
00:38:54,826 --> 00:38:55,956
So if I tap Help here,

910
00:38:56,456 --> 00:39:00,956
we can see that

911
00:38:56,456 --> 00:39:00,956
we can see that

912
00:39:00,956 --> 00:39:03,926
that make it good for

913
00:39:03,926 --> 00:39:05,016
such as clouds and terrains.

914
00:39:05,016 --> 00:39:07,926
That sounds like

915
00:39:07,926 --> 00:39:10,246
So I took this, and I just

916
00:39:10,466 --> 00:39:11,796
and I turned it into an image.

917
00:39:12,066 --> 00:39:13,636
So I wanted to look at my image.

918
00:39:14,606 --> 00:39:17,066
So if we run our playground --

919
00:39:17,066 --> 00:39:19,466
to Playgrounds on the

920
00:39:19,746 --> 00:39:21,486
on the right-hand side,

921
00:39:21,486 --> 00:39:23,476
For those of you who

922
00:39:23,666 --> 00:39:27,796
as your playground executes,

923
00:39:28,006 --> 00:39:29,456
And we can tap on this,

924
00:39:29,856 --> 00:39:33,486
and it'll show a little

925
00:39:33,486 --> 00:39:37,306
Now this a little bit small, so

926
00:39:37,596 --> 00:39:40,756
to zoom in a little bit and

927
00:39:40,756 --> 00:39:41,696
to think about the pixels.

928
00:39:41,696 --> 00:39:43,236
We're going to talk

929
00:39:43,786 --> 00:39:47,046
So now, I have a much bigger

930
00:39:47,046 --> 00:39:50,606
in line with the Add

931
00:39:50,746 --> 00:39:52,306
with our code as we scroll.

932
00:39:53,576 --> 00:39:56,166
So now that this is

933
00:39:56,166 --> 00:39:57,526
about our image a little bit.

934
00:39:57,526 --> 00:39:58,596
So we generated our noise,

935
00:39:58,596 --> 00:40:00,976
and we want to generate

936
00:39:58,596 --> 00:40:00,976
and we want to generate

937
00:40:01,196 --> 00:40:04,346
So what we're going to do is

938
00:40:04,406 --> 00:40:08,326
through this image, and

939
00:40:08,326 --> 00:40:10,826
we want it to be a very

940
00:40:10,826 --> 00:40:12,066
And when the image is bright,

941
00:40:12,066 --> 00:40:14,626
we want that to be a very

942
00:40:14,886 --> 00:40:16,816
So you can see in the

943
00:40:16,816 --> 00:40:19,506
it's a very sort of dark area,

944
00:40:19,506 --> 00:40:21,196
And in the bottom left

945
00:40:21,196 --> 00:40:22,656
so it's going to be high.

946
00:40:22,886 --> 00:40:27,906
So I wrote a just little

947
00:40:28,246 --> 00:40:31,256
It takes an 8-bit grayscale

948
00:40:31,256 --> 00:40:33,806
through the rows and the

949
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:38,426
for every position with the

950
00:40:38,776 --> 00:40:40,416
which we're going to

951
00:40:41,236 --> 00:40:45,686
Now, because we have a very

952
00:40:45,686 --> 00:40:50,616
255 for the full range of 8-bit

953
00:40:50,616 --> 00:40:52,506
So I wrote a small bucket

954
00:40:52,806 --> 00:40:55,456
and just to prove to myself

955
00:40:55,456 --> 00:41:00,226
of the possible values of

956
00:40:55,456 --> 00:41:00,226
of the possible values of

957
00:41:00,606 --> 00:41:05,406
and you can see with our

958
00:41:05,446 --> 00:41:06,806
to a nice stair step function.

959
00:41:07,146 --> 00:41:12,066
So we just get a range from

960
00:41:12,066 --> 00:41:15,326
And then we can go over

961
00:41:15,666 --> 00:41:18,206
and then we end up with a graph

962
00:41:19,176 --> 00:41:20,856
And this is interesting.

963
00:41:20,856 --> 00:41:25,206
It's kind of cool looking, but

964
00:41:25,206 --> 00:41:27,056
Like, you can see each point

965
00:41:27,056 --> 00:41:29,466
in our image now has an

966
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:33,446
but it's not exactly

967
00:41:33,446 --> 00:41:35,866
And normally, I would

968
00:41:35,866 --> 00:41:40,006
I don't have the deep knowledge

969
00:41:40,346 --> 00:41:42,416
from scratch the

970
00:41:42,526 --> 00:41:47,226
and I don't have the 3D skills

971
00:41:47,616 --> 00:41:48,836
but I happen to know

972
00:41:48,836 --> 00:41:53,136
to Code playground has a

973
00:41:53,136 --> 00:41:56,986
that I can use to progress

974
00:41:57,106 --> 00:41:59,306
So I'm going to move over into

975
00:41:59,736 --> 00:42:01,836
and we're going to already

976
00:41:59,736 --> 00:42:01,836
and we're going to already

977
00:42:02,416 --> 00:42:04,136
So this is the Create

978
00:42:04,566 --> 00:42:06,236
and if I just run

979
00:42:07,046 --> 00:42:09,826
you can see that we're just

980
00:42:10,916 --> 00:42:13,196
So I'm going to paste the

981
00:42:14,136 --> 00:42:16,176
and I want to type for a

982
00:42:16,176 --> 00:42:16,996
to hide the live view.

983
00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:20,806
And here, where we have our --

984
00:42:21,346 --> 00:42:24,826
where we just echoing

985
00:42:24,826 --> 00:42:28,846
we want to turn this

986
00:42:29,326 --> 00:42:33,886
So what we want to do is our

987
00:42:33,886 --> 00:42:34,616
us with a world.

988
00:42:35,076 --> 00:42:42,566
So in our world, we want

989
00:42:42,646 --> 00:42:44,006
and y value that we're at.

990
00:42:44,276 --> 00:42:45,966
And we're not taking

991
00:42:46,086 --> 00:42:47,996
so we need to make a height,

992
00:42:48,146 --> 00:42:54,826
and we want to call our

993
00:42:56,126 --> 00:43:05,206
and then for our height, we

994
00:42:56,126 --> 00:43:05,206
and then for our height, we

995
00:43:06,516 --> 00:43:08,836
And I just love this

996
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:09,546
to do it one more time.

997
00:43:10,706 --> 00:43:11,776
Then if we run this

998
00:43:17,736 --> 00:43:21,936
oh. We forgot to add

999
00:43:23,276 --> 00:43:27,876
So if we run this, you can see

1000
00:43:27,876 --> 00:43:30,886
that we're putting

1001
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:32,716
And I can see pretty quickly

1002
00:43:32,716 --> 00:43:34,176
that this isn't quite

1003
00:43:34,176 --> 00:43:37,206
There's these weird

1004
00:43:37,796 --> 00:43:38,886
and I don't want that.

1005
00:43:38,886 --> 00:43:41,216
I'm not generating a fantasy

1006
00:43:41,216 --> 00:43:42,806
I want to generate something

1007
00:43:43,306 --> 00:43:45,026
So let's stop that

1008
00:43:45,176 --> 00:43:48,636
So these blank spots didn't

1009
00:43:48,636 --> 00:43:50,586
at first, but after a

1010
00:43:51,056 --> 00:43:53,856
it's clear that when our height

1011
00:43:53,856 --> 00:43:55,706
from 0 to 4 and not 1 to 5,

1012
00:43:55,926 --> 00:43:57,576
we're just not putting

1013
00:43:57,886 --> 00:44:00,456
So our 0 spot seemed like a

1014
00:43:57,886 --> 00:44:00,456
So our 0 spot seemed like a

1015
00:44:01,406 --> 00:44:08,806
So if our height is less

1016
00:44:09,256 --> 00:44:14,116
we want to place water.

1017
00:44:17,476 --> 00:44:21,906
And now, if I tap If with our

1018
00:44:21,966 --> 00:44:23,186
we can add an L statement,

1019
00:44:23,626 --> 00:44:26,786
and just do what we

1020
00:44:27,326 --> 00:44:32,136
And this, I want to speed

00:44:32,136 --> 00:44:35,136
So my world also

1022
00:44:36,496 --> 00:44:40,656

All right, so let's run
