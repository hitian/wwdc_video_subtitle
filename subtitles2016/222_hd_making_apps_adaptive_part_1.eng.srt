[ Applause ]

3
00:00:22,046 --> 00:00:24,416
&gt;&gt; Good morning guys, how's

4
00:00:24,526 --> 00:00:27,666
My name is Kevin, I'm one of

5
00:00:27,666 --> 00:00:30,616
and Brent is going to join

6
00:00:30,616 --> 00:00:33,636
And what we want talk to you

7
00:00:33,756 --> 00:00:38,316
which is how do I make one app

8
00:00:38,556 --> 00:00:41,076
on all our devices right,

9
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:43,826
And so that's what we're

10
00:00:44,656 --> 00:00:47,156
And I'm going to give away my

11
00:00:47,586 --> 00:00:49,776
If there's one thing that

12
00:00:50,406 --> 00:00:54,286
when it comes to adaptivity

13
00:00:54,286 --> 00:00:57,336
of the work for you and so

14
00:00:57,956 --> 00:01:00,366
I'm going to tell you what the

15
00:00:57,956 --> 00:01:00,366
I'm going to tell you what the

16
00:01:00,366 --> 00:01:01,336
that would be nice to know.

17
00:01:01,816 --> 00:01:05,325
But also how you guys as

18
00:01:05,325 --> 00:01:07,376
and plug into that system.

19
00:01:08,926 --> 00:01:11,306
But before I do I actually

20
00:01:11,306 --> 00:01:13,356
to give this a little bit of

21
00:01:13,356 --> 00:01:16,496
to tell you why this statement

22
00:01:17,286 --> 00:01:19,356
So Apple had a pretty big mouth

23
00:01:19,356 --> 00:01:22,486
on this last year we

24
00:01:22,526 --> 00:01:24,556
I don't know about you,

25
00:01:24,556 --> 00:01:26,586
like mind-boggling to me.

26
00:01:27,446 --> 00:01:29,286
Now you make a fair point,

27
00:01:29,686 --> 00:01:32,156
when it comes adaptivity

28
00:01:32,846 --> 00:01:33,836
Fair, I'll give that to you.

29
00:01:34,256 --> 00:01:36,996
But we know that it's

30
00:01:36,996 --> 00:01:39,176
it's not all 1 billion

31
00:01:39,176 --> 00:01:40,346
so that would be

32
00:01:41,196 --> 00:01:43,486
Over the years Apple has

33
00:01:43,486 --> 00:01:46,296
of various form factors

34
00:01:46,456 --> 00:01:48,766
and shapes, I mean even colors.

35
00:01:49,996 --> 00:01:53,176
And at Apple we also

36
00:01:53,176 --> 00:01:56,276
of what device you have you can

37
00:01:56,276 --> 00:01:58,076
that be in portrait

38
00:01:59,046 --> 00:02:01,716
But beyond the physical devices

39
00:01:59,046 --> 00:02:01,716
But beyond the physical devices

40
00:02:01,716 --> 00:02:06,446
features like slide over and

41
00:02:06,446 --> 00:02:09,515
as well that just increases

42
00:02:09,515 --> 00:02:10,696
that your application can be in.

43
00:02:11,846 --> 00:02:13,636
Don't forget things

44
00:02:13,636 --> 00:02:16,106
where the user can

45
00:02:16,106 --> 00:02:18,696
and all your applications

46
00:02:18,696 --> 00:02:22,006
out right, you're

47
00:02:22,006 --> 00:02:23,326
And then we also have features

48
00:02:23,536 --> 00:02:27,266
like the language

49
00:02:27,266 --> 00:02:28,426
to right or right to left.

50
00:02:29,026 --> 00:02:31,846
We also have the display gamut

51
00:02:31,846 --> 00:02:32,856
that we released this year.

52
00:02:33,316 --> 00:02:35,186
And Apple TV we also

53
00:02:35,186 --> 00:02:37,726
like the interface style

54
00:02:38,316 --> 00:02:40,606
So kind of a conservative

55
00:02:40,606 --> 00:02:42,336
of combinations that your

56
00:02:42,336 --> 00:02:45,356
in iOS applications like

57
00:02:46,316 --> 00:02:46,856
That's a lot.

58
00:02:47,846 --> 00:02:51,136
So that's why this statement

59
00:02:51,136 --> 00:02:53,336
for you is really good news.

60
00:02:53,526 --> 00:02:56,616
Now the keyword here is most.

61
00:02:57,946 --> 00:03:01,976
There are a lot of ways that

62
00:02:57,946 --> 00:03:01,976
There are a lot of ways that

63
00:03:01,976 --> 00:03:03,426
and customize this experience

64
00:03:03,426 --> 00:03:05,106
because you want your

65
00:03:05,486 --> 00:03:07,536
And that's what we want

66
00:03:08,496 --> 00:03:12,456
So first we're going to talk

67
00:03:12,456 --> 00:03:14,546
of adaptivity, which we

68
00:03:14,606 --> 00:03:17,246
And then Brent's going to come

69
00:03:17,246 --> 00:03:19,576
of how we've improved

70
00:03:19,576 --> 00:03:21,296
with building adaptive

71
00:03:21,296 --> 00:03:23,696
And that's what we're

72
00:03:24,066 --> 00:03:25,176
which is today's session.

73
00:03:25,176 --> 00:03:28,496
You're definitely going to want

74
00:03:28,496 --> 00:03:30,736
because we're going to give

75
00:03:30,736 --> 00:03:33,606
of all these additional

76
00:03:33,606 --> 00:03:36,426
that you guys can use to make

77
00:03:36,556 --> 00:03:39,166
And then we're going to put it

78
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:40,946
to give you guys some

79
00:03:40,946 --> 00:03:42,396
and examples in code.

80
00:03:42,546 --> 00:03:44,326
All right, so let's

81
00:03:44,326 --> 00:03:46,946
about the fundamental

82
00:03:46,946 --> 00:03:48,186
which is called the trait system

83
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:50,456
and there's three particular

84
00:03:50,456 --> 00:03:51,756
to you guys about this.

85
00:03:51,756 --> 00:03:53,096
The first thing is I'm

86
00:03:53,096 --> 00:03:55,226
by telling you what it is, it's

87
00:03:55,226 --> 00:03:58,386
And then we're going to laser

88
00:03:58,386 --> 00:04:00,656
of the trait system, which

89
00:03:58,386 --> 00:04:00,656
of the trait system, which

90
00:04:00,656 --> 00:04:02,906
And I think it would be a

91
00:04:02,906 --> 00:04:04,036
of give you guys a

92
00:04:04,036 --> 00:04:05,386
about how the system works

93
00:04:05,386 --> 00:04:07,446
because that will make it

94
00:04:07,446 --> 00:04:08,286
to interact with it.

95
00:04:10,386 --> 00:04:11,116
So what are traits?

96
00:04:11,756 --> 00:04:14,006
Traits describe the environment

97
00:04:14,376 --> 00:04:16,266
that your application

98
00:04:17,516 --> 00:04:20,346
So here's an example of a

99
00:04:20,495 --> 00:04:23,546
And this just describes what

100
00:04:23,546 --> 00:04:26,326
for the available space of your

101
00:04:26,326 --> 00:04:28,006
you have a little bit of

102
00:04:28,296 --> 00:04:32,526
Now a trait by itself doesn't

103
00:04:32,526 --> 00:04:35,746
with it and that's where trait

104
00:04:35,746 --> 00:04:37,756
You can think of

105
00:04:37,756 --> 00:04:40,056
as pretty much a

106
00:04:40,056 --> 00:04:42,216
which are traits to values.

107
00:04:42,896 --> 00:04:45,536
Most of the traits have

108
00:04:45,536 --> 00:04:48,666
of possible values, so you know

109
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:50,746
about as you're building

110
00:04:51,866 --> 00:04:54,126
Now trait collections don't

111
00:04:54,126 --> 00:04:56,266
that would be awesome, usually

112
00:04:56,266 --> 00:04:57,536
And even the three that you see

113
00:04:57,536 --> 00:05:00,646
on the screen here is even

114
00:04:57,536 --> 00:05:00,646
on the screen here is even

115
00:05:00,646 --> 00:05:02,476
of the trait collections that

116
00:05:02,476 --> 00:05:04,666
with and making your

117
00:05:05,156 --> 00:05:07,736
Let me give you a

118
00:05:07,736 --> 00:05:09,036
of what some of the traits are.

119
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:11,056
So we'll talk more

120
00:05:11,136 --> 00:05:14,396
There's also dynamic type

121
00:05:14,396 --> 00:05:16,106
There's also the

122
00:05:16,106 --> 00:05:17,846
so left to right, right to left.

123
00:05:18,106 --> 00:05:21,716
And the three up here are

124
00:05:22,216 --> 00:05:24,256
Traits can also describe

125
00:05:24,596 --> 00:05:28,856
So what gamut is the display

126
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:31,276
or for Apple TV what

127
00:05:31,306 --> 00:05:33,026
is it light or dark.

128
00:05:34,116 --> 00:05:36,506
But traits can also

129
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:38,966
So for example, whether

130
00:05:39,036 --> 00:05:41,676
that you're using supports

131
00:05:42,696 --> 00:05:44,966
If you want a full list

132
00:05:44,966 --> 00:05:47,726
that you can make your

133
00:05:47,726 --> 00:05:49,496
out UITraitCollection's

134
00:05:49,986 --> 00:05:51,486
But now I want to

135
00:05:51,486 --> 00:05:53,646
in on talking about

136
00:05:54,886 --> 00:05:59,446
Your application can be in

137
00:05:59,496 --> 00:06:01,316
This is humorously

138
00:05:59,496 --> 00:06:01,316
This is humorously

139
00:06:01,316 --> 00:06:02,456
of what some of those sizes are.

140
00:06:03,486 --> 00:06:06,746
And when you look at this

141
00:06:06,746 --> 00:06:08,336
of customization that

142
00:06:08,806 --> 00:06:12,656
So first is the screen size,

143
00:06:13,026 --> 00:06:15,066
and third would be something

144
00:06:15,066 --> 00:06:17,216
this would be like which

145
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:20,196
So one way to do this without

146
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:23,016
to look for and respond

147
00:06:23,016 --> 00:06:25,476
of these things, but

148
00:06:25,906 --> 00:06:31,056
And so what will you do

149
00:06:31,256 --> 00:06:34,776
on the available space for your

150
00:06:34,776 --> 00:06:36,936
of those three axes

151
00:06:37,566 --> 00:06:39,746
So what do I mean by

152
00:06:39,746 --> 00:06:41,176
There's kind of two

153
00:06:41,176 --> 00:06:44,276
to available space given

154
00:06:44,756 --> 00:06:47,486
So there's coarse grain changes

155
00:06:47,516 --> 00:06:50,886
from within iPhone to an

156
00:06:51,476 --> 00:06:54,166
There's also fine grain

157
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:58,516
of like going from iPhone

158
00:06:59,056 --> 00:07:01,116
And for each one of

159
00:06:59,056 --> 00:07:01,116
And for each one of

160
00:07:01,116 --> 00:07:03,076
or coarse you're going to

161
00:07:03,076 --> 00:07:04,886
different technologies

162
00:07:05,646 --> 00:07:08,356
Let's start by talking

163
00:07:08,806 --> 00:07:11,466
I think we're pretty

164
00:07:11,686 --> 00:07:12,866
it's of my favorite quotes.

165
00:07:13,346 --> 00:07:16,336
We as engineers love to

166
00:07:16,576 --> 00:07:17,756
to help us solve problems,

167
00:07:17,756 --> 00:07:20,226
to make things easier,

168
00:07:20,796 --> 00:07:23,746
So size classes is a

169
00:07:24,396 --> 00:07:26,836
Now layers of indirection

170
00:07:26,836 --> 00:07:28,416
of higher order behavior.

171
00:07:28,886 --> 00:07:30,596
So what's the higher

172
00:07:30,596 --> 00:07:34,536
that size class is describing

173
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:37,356
Let me give you two

174
00:07:37,846 --> 00:07:40,766
So first will be the canonical

175
00:07:40,766 --> 00:07:41,306
time right.

176
00:07:41,736 --> 00:07:43,326
On iPad we have a master detail

177
00:07:43,326 --> 00:07:45,936
where the information is

178
00:07:46,246 --> 00:07:49,086
A change in the master

179
00:07:49,086 --> 00:07:50,056
on the right-hand side.

180
00:07:51,156 --> 00:07:53,216
However, on an iPhone where

181
00:07:53,596 --> 00:07:56,196
that way that we present

182
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:59,196
We instead use a navigation

183
00:07:59,196 --> 00:08:01,946
of a drill in way of

184
00:07:59,196 --> 00:08:01,946
of a drill in way of

185
00:08:02,856 --> 00:08:04,006
News would be another example.

186
00:08:04,246 --> 00:08:08,076
On the iPad we have this awesome

187
00:08:08,076 --> 00:08:11,196
on your couch and just be able

188
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:13,456
But on my iPhone

189
00:08:13,456 --> 00:08:15,686
where I can just quickly

190
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:20,086
So experience comes down to how

191
00:08:20,086 --> 00:08:22,116
and when you think about

192
00:08:22,116 --> 00:08:25,016
in your applications think

193
00:08:25,016 --> 00:08:27,916
the ways you're presenting

194
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:30,656
or not or how you're going

195
00:08:31,806 --> 00:08:34,816
So let's get specific for a

196
00:08:34,816 --> 00:08:36,086
of some higher-order things.

197
00:08:36,086 --> 00:08:38,416
What specifically

198
00:08:38,496 --> 00:08:40,676
And this is where we bring

199
00:08:41,025 --> 00:08:44,656
So size classes is two traits,

200
00:08:44,656 --> 00:08:45,966
and there's verticalSizeClass

201
00:08:46,246 --> 00:08:49,516
and there's two possible

202
00:08:50,006 --> 00:08:52,336
Compact just simply means

203
00:08:52,336 --> 00:08:54,166
And so you're going to

204
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:55,866
in a more compact way.

205
00:08:56,716 --> 00:08:58,966
Regular means that you're

206
00:08:58,966 --> 00:09:02,156
and you should totally feel

207
00:08:58,966 --> 00:09:02,156
and you should totally feel

208
00:09:02,156 --> 00:09:04,566
up to the edges of your

209
00:09:05,826 --> 00:09:07,996
Now this means that we

210
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:11,146
of traits and possible values.

211
00:09:12,106 --> 00:09:13,676
Now I just want to point

212
00:09:13,676 --> 00:09:15,236
of the notation that

213
00:09:15,236 --> 00:09:16,706
because this is notation

214
00:09:16,706 --> 00:09:18,326
in Interface Builder

215
00:09:18,326 --> 00:09:19,616
and elsewhere in the system.

216
00:09:19,786 --> 00:09:22,346
So this is describing a

217
00:09:22,346 --> 00:09:23,686
and there's two things

218
00:09:24,106 --> 00:09:27,216
First, it says there's a W

219
00:09:27,216 --> 00:09:29,856
and then the value C or

220
00:09:30,116 --> 00:09:32,616
And then H is for the height

221
00:09:32,696 --> 00:09:34,356
that again, has either C or R.

222
00:09:34,466 --> 00:09:35,976
So you're going to see

223
00:09:35,976 --> 00:09:37,486
and you're going to see

224
00:09:37,486 --> 00:09:39,486
and I just want you guys

225
00:09:40,266 --> 00:09:43,216
So how do some of the devices

226
00:09:43,796 --> 00:09:47,636
Well, a compact with experience,

227
00:09:47,636 --> 00:09:49,876
of that is going to be

228
00:09:50,586 --> 00:09:53,646
iPad in contrast is going

229
00:09:53,646 --> 00:09:55,976
in both orientations

230
00:09:56,056 --> 00:09:59,696
You're going to see

231
00:09:59,906 --> 00:10:03,776
in landscape with the notable

232
00:09:59,906 --> 00:10:03,776
in landscape with the notable

233
00:10:03,776 --> 00:10:06,396
which is actually regular

234
00:10:06,396 --> 00:10:08,996
in landscape, which is why

235
00:10:08,996 --> 00:10:11,806
in for example mail when

236
00:10:15,356 --> 00:10:17,526
How does this actually

237
00:10:17,526 --> 00:10:18,786
How does this make

238
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:21,146
Well, one obvious thing is

239
00:10:21,146 --> 00:10:24,436
of 300 combinations you

240
00:10:25,046 --> 00:10:26,176
but wait it gets better.

241
00:10:26,756 --> 00:10:29,406
You really only have to

242
00:10:29,406 --> 00:10:33,896
because the width class is

243
00:10:33,896 --> 00:10:36,646
or trait that you're going

244
00:10:36,646 --> 00:10:38,186
If we think about all the

245
00:10:38,446 --> 00:10:41,316
the layout traits are the

246
00:10:41,486 --> 00:10:42,726
of traits that you're

247
00:10:43,216 --> 00:10:46,336
And within the layout traits

248
00:10:46,616 --> 00:10:48,086
layout trait that you're

249
00:10:48,426 --> 00:10:52,006
And then specifically within

250
00:10:52,006 --> 00:10:53,526
by far the most common class

251
00:10:53,526 --> 00:10:54,716
that you're going

252
00:10:55,186 --> 00:10:57,176
Which means that as you're

253
00:10:57,176 --> 00:10:59,066
and thinking about how you

254
00:10:59,066 --> 00:11:02,616
between iPad and

255
00:10:59,066 --> 00:11:02,616
between iPad and

256
00:11:02,616 --> 00:11:04,486
about the differences

257
00:11:04,486 --> 00:11:06,006
Now certainly guys you're going

258
00:11:06,006 --> 00:11:07,196
to have custom applications

259
00:11:07,196 --> 00:11:09,206
to do special things,

260
00:11:09,206 --> 00:11:12,486
But certainly that's the most

261
00:11:12,486 --> 00:11:14,966
about the width class.

262
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:19,566
Now the system gets to decide

263
00:11:19,566 --> 00:11:22,026
and adaptations fit

264
00:11:22,176 --> 00:11:24,266
And what's interesting

265
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:27,886
that these combinations can

266
00:11:27,886 --> 00:11:30,086
as the users interacting

267
00:11:30,086 --> 00:11:32,576
I can bring over slide over,

268
00:11:32,846 --> 00:11:34,756
I can change the

269
00:11:35,306 --> 00:11:37,676
And so if you're

270
00:11:37,676 --> 00:11:40,106
and you're expressing your

271
00:11:40,376 --> 00:11:43,426
the system can do a bunch of

272
00:11:43,426 --> 00:11:45,906
through all these different

273
00:11:45,906 --> 00:11:47,966
and adaptations past,

274
00:11:48,436 --> 00:11:50,226
And that's really, really

275
00:11:50,226 --> 00:11:51,486
to make it much easier

276
00:11:51,486 --> 00:11:53,386
to make your applications

277
00:11:54,456 --> 00:11:57,506
Let me give you two examples

278
00:11:57,506 --> 00:11:59,766
of changes that can

279
00:12:00,506 --> 00:12:01,486
So here again, we're going back

280
00:12:01,486 --> 00:12:03,106
to our split view

281
00:12:03,706 --> 00:12:06,166
And when I'm on an iPad

282
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:08,256
to have those two view

283
00:12:08,256 --> 00:12:10,316
but when I go to an iPhone,

284
00:12:10,636 --> 00:12:11,776
into a navigation controller.

285
00:12:12,186 --> 00:12:13,856
If you're using UI Split

286
00:12:13,856 --> 00:12:15,356
to get this behavior for free.

287
00:12:16,346 --> 00:12:19,096
Now besides just view controller

288
00:12:19,096 --> 00:12:19,986
to presentations.

289
00:12:20,276 --> 00:12:22,596
So if I have an iPad and I

290
00:12:22,596 --> 00:12:23,886
to be this callout style.

291
00:12:24,396 --> 00:12:26,256
But if I move to an

292
00:12:26,256 --> 00:12:28,236
to be a modal presentation

293
00:12:28,856 --> 00:12:30,786
So again, if you're

294
00:12:30,786 --> 00:12:32,116
and the kit presentations

295
00:12:32,116 --> 00:12:34,076
to get a lot of behavior

296
00:12:34,486 --> 00:12:35,996
The size classes

297
00:12:35,996 --> 00:12:36,986
and your application is going

298
00:12:36,986 --> 00:12:38,606
to automatically adapt,

299
00:12:38,766 --> 00:12:42,466
So let me talk to you a second

300
00:12:42,466 --> 00:12:44,266
I just want to say one

301
00:12:44,606 --> 00:12:47,476
within the same size

302
00:12:47,476 --> 00:12:51,966
to use Auto Layout to react to

303
00:12:52,316 --> 00:12:55,036
Withy Auto Layout you can

304
00:12:55,036 --> 00:12:56,246
in a very declarative form

305
00:12:56,316 --> 00:12:58,326
and then the system will

306
00:12:58,326 --> 00:13:01,926
and resize things for you as

307
00:12:58,326 --> 00:13:01,926
and resize things for you as

308
00:13:02,046 --> 00:13:03,336
at a more fine grain level.

309
00:13:04,766 --> 00:13:08,706
Now there's one more type of

310
00:13:08,706 --> 00:13:11,036
and I call that medium

311
00:13:11,456 --> 00:13:13,256
I'm not going to tell you

312
00:13:13,256 --> 00:13:15,186
to keep the suspense high

313
00:13:15,186 --> 00:13:16,486
for part 2 and they're

314
00:13:16,486 --> 00:13:18,096
about medium grain changes.

315
00:13:19,196 --> 00:13:21,936
All right, so we've talked

316
00:13:21,936 --> 00:13:25,036
we have given you kind of an

317
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:26,976
What I want to do now is just

318
00:13:26,976 --> 00:13:28,886
about how the system

319
00:13:28,886 --> 00:13:32,006
as developers you're

320
00:13:32,796 --> 00:13:34,776
In a nutshell or in

321
00:13:35,026 --> 00:13:37,726
the way the trait system works

322
00:13:37,966 --> 00:13:38,926
and it propagates it

323
00:13:38,926 --> 00:13:42,836
down through your view hierarchy

324
00:13:42,836 --> 00:13:44,746
chance to react to

325
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:47,436
So it all starts at the screen

326
00:13:47,436 --> 00:13:48,476
to have a trait collection.

327
00:13:48,806 --> 00:13:52,166
What's important to note about

328
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:53,876
and orientation and

329
00:13:53,876 --> 00:13:56,366
to have a fully specified

330
00:13:56,686 --> 00:13:57,496
And what I mean by that is

331
00:13:57,496 --> 00:14:00,046
that all the different traits

332
00:13:57,496 --> 00:14:00,046
that all the different traits

333
00:14:00,096 --> 00:14:03,066
Then the screen is going to

334
00:14:03,066 --> 00:14:06,106
that are on that screen and then

335
00:14:06,106 --> 00:14:08,426
to its root view

336
00:14:08,426 --> 00:14:10,146
then down to its

337
00:14:10,146 --> 00:14:11,806
and subviews and so on.

338
00:14:12,856 --> 00:14:16,596
Now each stop along the way

339
00:14:16,596 --> 00:14:20,076
to UITraitEnvironment and the

340
00:14:20,076 --> 00:14:22,816
method called

341
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:24,826
So at each stop along the way

342
00:14:24,826 --> 00:14:26,326
as this trait collection

343
00:14:26,326 --> 00:14:28,716
down it's going to call

344
00:14:29,106 --> 00:14:31,966
This is where you as

345
00:14:32,176 --> 00:14:34,066
and make your applications

346
00:14:34,446 --> 00:14:36,526
So traitCollectionDidChange

347
00:14:37,696 --> 00:14:40,416
And you're almost exclusively

348
00:14:40,536 --> 00:14:42,676
at the view controller

349
00:14:43,676 --> 00:14:46,446
Now that was a pretty simple

350
00:14:46,446 --> 00:14:47,736
bit more complicated example?

351
00:14:48,136 --> 00:14:50,456
So let's go to an iPad

352
00:14:50,496 --> 00:14:52,336
We have our screen, just going

353
00:14:52,336 --> 00:14:53,686
to the view split view

354
00:14:54,156 --> 00:14:56,726
Now here is where we see a

355
00:14:57,076 --> 00:14:59,296
and that's as the trait

356
00:14:59,296 --> 00:15:02,156
down you can actually

357
00:14:59,296 --> 00:15:02,156
down you can actually

358
00:15:02,156 --> 00:15:04,446
as it gets propagated to

359
00:15:04,856 --> 00:15:06,666
So the split view controller

360
00:15:06,986 --> 00:15:07,986
So what it's going

361
00:15:07,986 --> 00:15:10,236
to change the trait

362
00:15:10,236 --> 00:15:11,706
to the master view controller.

363
00:15:11,706 --> 00:15:14,716
It's going to change

364
00:15:15,006 --> 00:15:17,516
to a compact size

365
00:15:17,516 --> 00:15:19,276
to pass the regular

366
00:15:19,936 --> 00:15:21,086
You guys can do this too

367
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:24,256
as you build your own custom

368
00:15:24,626 --> 00:15:28,416
but most commonly you

369
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:30,886
Here's an example of what

370
00:15:30,886 --> 00:15:31,276
look like.

371
00:15:31,306 --> 00:15:33,746
I'm going to walk you

372
00:15:34,046 --> 00:15:36,046
First, in order for the system

373
00:15:36,046 --> 00:15:37,196
you want to make

374
00:15:38,056 --> 00:15:41,036
Next, you want to only

375
00:15:41,036 --> 00:15:42,906
that you're interested

376
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:45,726
Now I hear you questioning

377
00:15:45,726 --> 00:15:47,836
traitCollectionDidChange

378
00:15:47,836 --> 00:15:48,656
that traits are changing?

379
00:15:48,816 --> 00:15:49,746
That is absolutely true.

380
00:15:50,156 --> 00:15:53,666
Trait collection gets called

381
00:15:54,196 --> 00:15:56,356
Typically, your application

382
00:15:56,356 --> 00:15:59,916
in a few traits and most

383
00:16:00,356 --> 00:16:01,066
size class.

384
00:16:01,406 --> 00:16:02,266
And so you want to make sure

385
00:16:02,266 --> 00:16:05,246
that you're not doing any extra

386
00:16:05,246 --> 00:16:07,086
that you're interested

387
00:16:08,046 --> 00:16:11,336
Next, I'm going to switch

388
00:16:11,336 --> 00:16:13,346
for the horizontalSizeClass.

389
00:16:13,396 --> 00:16:14,656
As just a side note here,

390
00:16:15,056 --> 00:16:18,246
I really prefer using switch

391
00:16:18,246 --> 00:16:21,706
with enumerations in both Swift

392
00:16:21,706 --> 00:16:24,596
that if the definition

393
00:16:24,596 --> 00:16:28,006
if a new case comes in I'm

394
00:16:28,366 --> 00:16:30,146
if I'm using an exhaustive

395
00:16:30,486 --> 00:16:32,636
So I would just really encourage

396
00:16:32,636 --> 00:16:34,206
that's really saved

397
00:16:35,096 --> 00:16:37,356
So then for example if

398
00:16:37,356 --> 00:16:39,406
then I would go off

399
00:16:39,806 --> 00:16:42,766
So for any view, for any

400
00:16:42,766 --> 00:16:44,386
to be adaptive I would need

401
00:16:44,386 --> 00:16:47,006
to override

402
00:16:47,176 --> 00:16:49,586
So again, this is going

403
00:16:49,586 --> 00:16:51,356
that conforms to

404
00:16:51,966 --> 00:16:54,536
And this is where you're

405
00:16:55,376 --> 00:16:57,426
Now it might seem like

406
00:16:57,426 --> 00:16:59,426
to implement

407
00:16:59,426 --> 00:17:01,576
for every single view

408
00:16:59,426 --> 00:17:01,576
for every single view

409
00:17:01,576 --> 00:17:03,626
for all the possible

410
00:17:04,215 --> 00:17:05,526
A lot of things can change.

411
00:17:05,986 --> 00:17:09,126
So that's why there's a number

412
00:17:09,126 --> 00:17:11,126
to traitCollectionDidChange

413
00:17:12,096 --> 00:17:14,726
So for example, one system

414
00:17:14,816 --> 00:17:17,486
If you're using Interface

415
00:17:17,806 --> 00:17:19,746
and you're using

416
00:17:20,056 --> 00:17:22,226
within Interface Builder

417
00:17:22,226 --> 00:17:25,256
to automatically apply that as

418
00:17:26,056 --> 00:17:27,806
Another example would

419
00:17:28,116 --> 00:17:30,256
You can specify images

420
00:17:30,256 --> 00:17:32,576
for different size classes,

421
00:17:32,746 --> 00:17:34,726
and those will automatically

422
00:17:34,726 --> 00:17:36,126
in traitCollectionDidChange.

423
00:17:36,926 --> 00:17:40,676
And then finally, UIAppearance

424
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:41,886
for trait collection.

425
00:17:41,886 --> 00:17:44,616
So you could for example set

426
00:17:44,616 --> 00:17:48,036
for light and dark mode in Apple

427
00:17:48,036 --> 00:17:49,366
automatically be applied

428
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:51,266
in traitCollectionDidChange

429
00:17:51,266 --> 00:17:53,446
So you really want to take

430
00:17:53,446 --> 00:17:55,406
that respond to this for

431
00:17:55,406 --> 00:17:58,596
to be very declarative about

432
00:17:58,596 --> 00:17:59,866
to react and to adapt.

433
00:17:59,946 --> 00:18:02,276
And it makes it really easy

434
00:17:59,946 --> 00:18:02,276
And it makes it really easy

435
00:18:03,656 --> 00:18:06,436
So just to recap

436
00:18:06,436 --> 00:18:07,386
that we've seen so far.

437
00:18:07,806 --> 00:18:11,436
Traits describe the environment

438
00:18:11,436 --> 00:18:14,646
in and a trait collection is

439
00:18:14,646 --> 00:18:16,106
with their associated values.

440
00:18:16,296 --> 00:18:20,606
These could be layout traits,

441
00:18:20,606 --> 00:18:21,936
they could be capabilities

442
00:18:23,066 --> 00:18:24,936
You want to override

443
00:18:24,936 --> 00:18:26,856
to make your application

444
00:18:27,016 --> 00:18:29,106
and you want take advantage

445
00:18:29,106 --> 00:18:30,646
to traitCollectionDidChange

446
00:18:31,756 --> 00:18:34,976
The size classes describe the

447
00:18:35,276 --> 00:18:37,206
how is your information

448
00:18:38,036 --> 00:18:40,666
And then just to drive it home

449
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:42,466
to be able to do so

450
00:18:42,466 --> 00:18:44,166
if you're taking

451
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:44,786
that we're giving you.

452
00:18:46,526 --> 00:18:49,396
Now I could draw on

453
00:18:49,396 --> 00:18:51,326
about how awesome aptivity is,

454
00:18:51,836 --> 00:18:53,676
but really to see how

455
00:18:53,676 --> 00:18:54,646
to see it in action.

456
00:18:55,026 --> 00:18:57,536
And so I want to bring up

457
00:18:57,826 --> 00:18:59,746
of the changes that we have

458
00:18:59,876 --> 00:19:01,476
to improve our workflows

459
00:18:59,876 --> 00:19:01,476

[ Applause ]

462
00:19:09,336 --> 00:19:09,956
&gt;&gt; Thank you Kevin.

463
00:19:10,356 --> 00:19:12,516
So now that you understand

464
00:19:12,516 --> 00:19:14,596
of adding adaptivity

465
00:19:14,776 --> 00:19:16,696
So that's traits,

466
00:19:16,696 --> 00:19:19,546
and size classes I'm going

467
00:19:19,546 --> 00:19:22,306
and the Interface Builder editor

468
00:19:22,456 --> 00:19:23,736
So let's go over to

469
00:19:24,406 --> 00:19:27,000
It's a long way over here man.

470
00:19:32,046 --> 00:19:33,636
Okay, so I thought

471
00:19:33,636 --> 00:19:38,416
to build a really simple view to

472
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:40,106
of using the trait

473
00:19:40,536 --> 00:19:41,946
to add a little bit

474
00:19:42,496 --> 00:19:44,096
So here's what we're

475
00:19:44,096 --> 00:19:47,676
This is simple, this describes

476
00:19:47,676 --> 00:19:48,376
you should definitely put it

477
00:19:48,376 --> 00:19:49,786
on your bucket list

478
00:19:49,786 --> 00:19:50,956
in Yosemite to see one day.

479
00:19:51,396 --> 00:19:53,466
So this view shows

480
00:19:53,466 --> 00:19:55,656
and at the bottom is

481
00:19:56,076 --> 00:19:58,096
And notice that on

482
00:19:58,096 --> 00:19:59,536
of different changes,

483
00:19:59,536 --> 00:20:00,846
that aren't present on iPhone.

484
00:19:59,536 --> 00:20:00,846
that aren't present on iPhone.

485
00:20:01,816 --> 00:20:04,626
You see at the top the label

486
00:20:04,886 --> 00:20:06,186
and in fact, there's

487
00:20:06,266 --> 00:20:07,726
that appears just on iPad.

488
00:20:07,726 --> 00:20:09,676
So we're going to build

489
00:20:10,006 --> 00:20:13,116
and you'll see how easy it is

490
00:20:13,926 --> 00:20:15,816
So I've already created

491
00:20:15,816 --> 00:20:20,036
over to this other tab where

492
00:20:20,626 --> 00:20:22,676
So there are couple

493
00:20:22,676 --> 00:20:26,236
at in the Interface

494
00:20:26,766 --> 00:20:28,456
First off, is look how

495
00:20:29,336 --> 00:20:31,736
It looks like an iPhone

496
00:20:31,736 --> 00:20:33,006
because it actually is.

497
00:20:33,006 --> 00:20:34,476
We're actually using

498
00:20:34,736 --> 00:20:35,756
to render this content,

499
00:20:35,756 --> 00:20:38,376
so you now get pixel

500
00:20:38,376 --> 00:20:39,376
in the design canvas.

501
00:20:39,476 --> 00:20:42,256
We think this is going to be a

502
00:20:42,476 --> 00:20:44,126
as you try to take

503
00:20:44,126 --> 00:20:46,886
from a designer and translate

504
00:20:47,556 --> 00:20:50,556
The other thing to point out

505
00:20:54,286 --> 00:20:56,916
The other big changes

506
00:20:56,916 --> 00:20:59,196
in Interface Builder canvas

507
00:20:59,196 --> 00:21:02,036
in the dimensions of actual

508
00:20:59,196 --> 00:21:02,036
in the dimensions of actual

509
00:21:02,036 --> 00:21:04,366
of their configurations

510
00:21:04,366 --> 00:21:05,576
from previous versions of Xcode.

511
00:21:06,366 --> 00:21:09,136
Let's take another look at

512
00:21:09,216 --> 00:21:11,806
I'm going to zoom in

513
00:21:11,806 --> 00:21:13,646
so you can see everything here.

514
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:16,376
So this is the bottom button bar

515
00:21:16,626 --> 00:21:17,786
it's been around

516
00:21:18,096 --> 00:21:20,586
Over on the right-hand side

517
00:21:20,586 --> 00:21:21,866
for adding all the

518
00:21:22,136 --> 00:21:23,206
I hope you're familiar

519
00:21:23,646 --> 00:21:26,916
And in the middle are the new

520
00:21:27,196 --> 00:21:29,776
And if you haven't yet installed

521
00:21:29,776 --> 00:21:31,676
it's amazing to be able

522
00:21:31,966 --> 00:21:33,686
at any magnification

523
00:21:33,686 --> 00:21:34,976
So definitely check

00:21:35,516 --> 00:21:39,876
[ Applause ]

525
00:21:40,376 --> 00:21:42,866
But today I'm going to talk

526
00:21:43,736 --> 00:21:45,816
So it says View As

527
00:21:45,816 --> 00:21:47,716
in parenthesis it's got

528
00:21:48,146 --> 00:21:51,656
if you can't read it back

529
00:21:51,916 --> 00:21:53,536
So this is telling

530
00:21:53,616 --> 00:21:55,266
of the current device

531
00:21:55,266 --> 00:21:55,906
that I'm looking at.

532
00:21:56,376 --> 00:21:57,816
It's an iPhone 6s in portrait,

533
00:21:58,046 --> 00:22:01,046
which means that it's a compact

534
00:21:58,046 --> 00:22:01,046
which means that it's a compact

535
00:22:01,046 --> 00:22:03,236
So it's a little bit of

536
00:22:03,386 --> 00:22:06,446
and I'll show you how you can

537
00:22:07,246 --> 00:22:10,336
So the scene is currently

538
00:22:10,336 --> 00:22:12,156
in portrait what if I

539
00:22:12,516 --> 00:22:15,476
Well, all you need to do

540
00:22:15,476 --> 00:22:17,426
and it opens the new

541
00:22:17,826 --> 00:22:19,856
This is brand new in Xcode

542
00:22:25,096 --> 00:22:27,516
So I zoomed in here so you can

543
00:22:27,516 --> 00:22:29,716
So there are a couple

544
00:22:29,946 --> 00:22:32,366
and the leftmost stack

545
00:22:32,416 --> 00:22:34,896
device sizes that

546
00:22:34,896 --> 00:22:37,066
So we have the largest

547
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:39,496
and the smallest

548
00:22:39,876 --> 00:22:42,186
And next to that is

549
00:22:42,186 --> 00:22:44,126
that lets you select the

550
00:22:44,126 --> 00:22:44,896
to view the scenes in.

551
00:22:45,236 --> 00:22:46,196

I'm going to switch

553

of these devices

555
00:22:52,826 --> 00:22:55,506

00:23:00,436 --> 00:23:04,006
So iPhones are interesting

559
00:23:04,006 --> 00:23:06,216
but iPads are even

560
00:23:06,216 --> 00:23:07,306
I'm going to select

561
00:23:07,766 --> 00:23:09,876
and you can see what happened

562
00:23:09,876 --> 00:23:12,626
of icons that appeared and

563
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:14,746

your users can choose

00:23:22,176 --> 00:23:23,666
in slide over or split view.

568
00:23:24,126 --> 00:23:25,586
So that's what these

569
00:23:25,726 --> 00:23:29,446
So if I select this one you can

570
00:23:29,496 --> 00:23:32,216
as the app would if

571
00:23:32,216 --> 00:23:33,526
in slide over on iPad.

572
00:23:34,036 --> 00:23:36,526
So think about this right in

573
00:23:36,526 --> 00:23:38,406
through all of these

574
00:23:38,706 --> 00:23:40,596
all these orientations,

575
00:23:40,876 --> 00:23:42,866
and see how your content

576
00:23:42,866 --> 00:23:44,696
I mean, this is a really

577
00:23:44,696 --> 00:23:46,976
it's going to save

578
00:23:47,516 --> 00:23:51,876
[ Applause ]

579
00:23:52,376 --> 00:23:53,706
Okay, so those are some

580
00:23:53,706 --> 00:23:55,076
in Interface Builder in Xcode 8.

581
00:23:55,326 --> 00:23:57,976
Now let's get down to the task

582
00:23:58,536 --> 00:24:00,036
So here's what we're

583
00:23:58,536 --> 00:24:00,036
So here's what we're

584
00:24:00,116 --> 00:24:02,006
We're going to add this label

585
00:24:02,006 --> 00:24:05,206
in such a way that it applies

586
00:24:05,306 --> 00:24:07,426
This is probably

587
00:24:07,426 --> 00:24:08,706
of the time in Interface

588
00:24:09,236 --> 00:24:11,236
You're usually not making

589
00:24:11,236 --> 00:24:13,106
on size classes a lot.

590
00:24:13,376 --> 00:24:14,826
So let's do this right now.

591
00:24:15,376 --> 00:24:19,276
So I have the Device

592
00:24:19,386 --> 00:24:20,566
and iPads selected there,

593
00:24:20,566 --> 00:24:23,146
it doesn't really matter what's

594
00:24:23,146 --> 00:24:25,336
to do is going to

595
00:24:26,096 --> 00:24:27,456
So I found a label

596
00:24:27,456 --> 00:24:30,236
in the Interface Builder

597
00:24:30,386 --> 00:24:32,106
And now what I'm

598
00:24:32,106 --> 00:24:33,516
to add some Auto

599
00:24:33,896 --> 00:24:38,156
And as Kevin said, this is one

600
00:24:38,596 --> 00:24:41,736
that actually makes

601
00:24:41,806 --> 00:24:43,366
to all different

602
00:24:43,366 --> 00:24:45,136
So I'm going to add

603
00:24:45,716 --> 00:24:50,186
I'm going to pin this to

604
00:24:50,606 --> 00:24:53,046
I'm going to center it

605
00:24:53,446 --> 00:24:55,776
and I'm going to add a vertical

606
00:24:56,206 --> 00:24:58,766
and the image view

607
00:24:59,476 --> 00:25:01,646
And I've got some

608
00:24:59,476 --> 00:25:01,646
And I've got some

609
00:25:01,646 --> 00:25:03,686
and it looks like that's right.

610
00:25:03,686 --> 00:25:07,106
And I had a constraint

611
00:25:07,106 --> 00:25:09,056
and the top layout guide,

612
00:25:09,136 --> 00:25:12,326
because I've added a label,

613
00:25:13,076 --> 00:25:14,816
So how do I know that

614
00:25:14,816 --> 00:25:15,856
and added the right constraints?

615
00:25:15,856 --> 00:25:17,706
Well this is where the Device

616
00:25:17,706 --> 00:25:19,156
in because it's really easy

617
00:25:19,516 --> 00:25:21,096
to see what it looks

618
00:25:21,336 --> 00:25:23,156
And you can see that it's

619
00:25:23,156 --> 00:25:26,226
as I cycle through all

620
00:25:26,226 --> 00:25:28,006
through different

621
00:25:28,436 --> 00:25:30,956
So that's an operation

622
00:25:31,226 --> 00:25:34,376
in Interface Builder

623
00:25:34,816 --> 00:25:37,266
So now let's start

624
00:25:37,266 --> 00:25:39,976
some customizations using

625
00:25:40,696 --> 00:25:41,526
So what are we going to do now?

626
00:25:42,346 --> 00:25:43,606
We're going to change the label,

627
00:25:43,716 --> 00:25:45,636
the font of this

628
00:25:46,006 --> 00:25:47,776
And you see my designer

629
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:50,706
to be System Semibold

630
00:25:51,676 --> 00:25:53,046
So let's go back

631
00:25:54,156 --> 00:25:56,986
So when you think about

632
00:25:57,106 --> 00:25:58,836
for a device you

633
00:25:58,836 --> 00:26:02,576
about adding a customization for

634
00:25:58,836 --> 00:26:02,576
about adding a customization for

635
00:26:02,576 --> 00:26:04,086
or in this case a size class.

636
00:26:04,576 --> 00:26:08,166
So we're all given designs for

637
00:26:08,586 --> 00:26:11,286
but as developers you need

638
00:26:11,286 --> 00:26:13,916
that into size class that

639
00:26:14,236 --> 00:26:15,266
We make that really

640
00:26:15,466 --> 00:26:19,536
So for example, I have an iPad

641
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:22,806
and the size class and I'll zoom

642
00:26:23,606 --> 00:26:26,016
it now says regular

643
00:26:26,246 --> 00:26:27,266
Okay, so you don't need to guess

644
00:26:27,266 --> 00:26:29,686
about what size class a

645
00:26:29,686 --> 00:26:32,386
is you just select that

646
00:26:32,386 --> 00:26:34,206
and Interface Builder

647
00:26:34,206 --> 00:26:35,886
And that's another great

648
00:26:36,336 --> 00:26:39,956
So now let's introduce,

649
00:26:40,176 --> 00:26:43,756
let's vary how this label

650
00:26:44,576 --> 00:26:47,556
So I'll select it in

651
00:26:47,626 --> 00:26:48,836
over to the Attributes

652
00:26:48,836 --> 00:26:50,256
which I actually have

653
00:26:50,326 --> 00:26:52,026
And I'm going to

654
00:26:52,066 --> 00:26:54,406
so you can get a closer

655
00:26:55,896 --> 00:26:59,646
So you might see out there that

656
00:26:59,796 --> 00:27:02,396
that is a big cursor, have

657
00:26:59,796 --> 00:27:02,396
that is a big cursor, have

658
00:27:02,816 --> 00:27:04,336
And so the + button means

659
00:27:04,336 --> 00:27:07,576
that particular attribute can

660
00:27:07,576 --> 00:27:08,446
collection system.

661
00:27:09,306 --> 00:27:10,156
So let's do that right now.

662
00:27:10,726 --> 00:27:12,196
I want to change the

663
00:27:12,196 --> 00:27:14,516
And the menu comes up

664
00:27:14,516 --> 00:27:15,706
to add a customization

665
00:27:15,836 --> 00:27:17,616
for regular width

666
00:27:17,616 --> 00:27:19,066
Well why is it doing that?

667
00:27:19,386 --> 00:27:21,626
Well it's because I

668
00:27:21,796 --> 00:27:23,936
regular height device

669
00:27:24,036 --> 00:27:24,726
so that makes sense.

670
00:27:25,906 --> 00:27:28,556
So we'll do that

671
00:27:28,556 --> 00:27:31,196
that the Attributes Inspector

672
00:27:31,196 --> 00:27:31,656
for font.

673
00:27:32,116 --> 00:27:33,656
And again, it has

674
00:27:34,066 --> 00:27:37,416
in the Attributes Inspector

675
00:27:37,566 --> 00:27:39,316
Okay, so that's why

676
00:27:39,406 --> 00:27:41,356
that what's here is you

677
00:27:45,586 --> 00:27:47,806
Okay, so let's make the change,

678
00:27:48,016 --> 00:27:51,276
I'll select Semibold and since I

679
00:27:51,276 --> 00:27:52,546
me to do 36.

680
00:27:53,096 --> 00:27:55,096
There we go and I'll click Done.

681
00:27:55,096 --> 00:27:58,216
And you can see it rendered

682
00:27:58,216 --> 00:28:02,416
If I select an iPhone what I

683
00:27:58,216 --> 00:28:02,416
If I select an iPhone what I

684
00:28:02,596 --> 00:28:04,586
the font remains what

685
00:28:04,676 --> 00:28:07,836
because I only targeted regular

686
00:28:08,006 --> 00:28:09,136
for that particular edit.

687
00:28:09,846 --> 00:28:12,866
Okay, so that's an example of

688
00:28:12,866 --> 00:28:15,756
to add a customization

689
00:28:16,216 --> 00:28:17,456
So that's the first

690
00:28:18,116 --> 00:28:22,696
Let's add another one and this

691
00:28:22,696 --> 00:28:24,776
and I want to do it

692
00:28:25,276 --> 00:28:28,136
So I'll go back to the

693
00:28:28,136 --> 00:28:28,966
to add this customization

694
00:28:28,966 --> 00:28:30,766
for iPad I should select

695
00:28:31,486 --> 00:28:35,086
And let me draw your attention

696
00:28:35,086 --> 00:28:36,626
that says Vary for

697
00:28:37,446 --> 00:28:40,146
So when you click this button

698
00:28:40,146 --> 00:28:43,536
and ask you how we want

699
00:28:43,536 --> 00:28:46,346
what kind of traits, the trait

700
00:28:47,206 --> 00:28:48,126
So what does this mean?

701
00:28:48,456 --> 00:28:49,556
Well I have a regular width,

702
00:28:49,776 --> 00:28:54,966
regular height size class device

703
00:28:54,966 --> 00:28:56,746
to customize for regular

704
00:28:56,746 --> 00:28:58,716
if I hit click both

705
00:28:59,246 --> 00:29:02,356
But I also can choose to

706
00:28:59,246 --> 00:29:02,356
But I also can choose to

707
00:29:02,496 --> 00:29:06,096
and any height or for any

708
00:29:06,696 --> 00:29:10,316
So I think what I want is to

709
00:29:10,786 --> 00:29:13,316
and when I do that the bar

710
00:29:13,316 --> 00:29:14,256
to tell me that I'm going

711
00:29:14,546 --> 00:29:17,496
to be making customizations

712
00:29:18,016 --> 00:29:21,116
Let's take a closer look

713
00:29:22,086 --> 00:29:22,736
I'll zoom in here.

714
00:29:23,836 --> 00:29:27,356
So you can see it says I'm

715
00:29:27,646 --> 00:29:29,446
devices, the device

716
00:29:29,886 --> 00:29:33,296
I see iPads both in portrait

717
00:29:33,926 --> 00:29:37,136
of the slide over configurations

718
00:29:37,266 --> 00:29:39,916
But I also see an iPhone here,

719
00:29:40,356 --> 00:29:41,546
Well if I put the mouse cursor

720
00:29:41,546 --> 00:29:45,046
over this I see this is an

721
00:29:45,046 --> 00:29:46,476
and as Kevin said,

722
00:29:46,476 --> 00:29:49,616
so big it actually uses the

723
00:29:49,666 --> 00:29:50,296
in landscape.

724
00:29:50,706 --> 00:29:53,186
And this is great and you'll

725
00:29:53,526 --> 00:29:56,586
and provide a different

726
00:29:56,586 --> 00:29:57,466
in that configuration,

727
00:29:57,636 --> 00:29:58,976
but in this case I

728
00:29:58,976 --> 00:30:01,486
I only want to make the

729
00:29:58,976 --> 00:30:01,486
I only want to make the

730
00:30:02,096 --> 00:30:02,776
So what do I do?

731
00:30:02,896 --> 00:30:04,676
Well I can go back into

732
00:30:04,796 --> 00:30:06,866
and this time I'm going to

733
00:30:07,156 --> 00:30:09,846
and regular height and

734
00:30:09,896 --> 00:30:12,176
that the iPhone disappears

735
00:30:12,876 --> 00:30:15,106
So the edits I'm about

736
00:30:15,336 --> 00:30:17,736
to these particular

737
00:30:18,096 --> 00:30:20,336
So let's do that now.

738
00:30:20,336 --> 00:30:23,996
I'm going to drag out a label,

739
00:30:24,916 --> 00:30:27,366
and I'll add just a

740
00:30:27,366 --> 00:30:30,926
to make sure it stays in the

741
00:30:30,926 --> 00:30:32,506
Now I'll click Done Varying.

742
00:30:33,396 --> 00:30:34,846
So let's go back to the

743
00:30:34,846 --> 00:30:37,586
because I want to focus

744
00:30:37,586 --> 00:30:38,856
that you've maybe seen before,

745
00:30:39,186 --> 00:30:41,216
I want to make sure you

746
00:30:41,216 --> 00:30:41,606
all about.

747
00:30:42,726 --> 00:30:45,966
So I varied for traits, I

748
00:30:46,646 --> 00:30:49,076
which means I configured the

749
00:30:49,076 --> 00:30:50,326
for regular width,

750
00:30:50,776 --> 00:30:53,406
And so when I did that

751
00:30:53,586 --> 00:30:56,566
I added it to a view hierarchy,

752
00:30:56,806 --> 00:30:59,256
for regular width

753
00:30:59,536 --> 00:31:01,416
So that's what this

754
00:30:59,536 --> 00:31:01,416
So that's what this

755
00:31:01,886 --> 00:31:03,906
Most of the time

756
00:31:04,026 --> 00:31:06,376
to your scene they'll be

757
00:31:06,456 --> 00:31:08,766
so they'll appear on all device

758
00:31:08,766 --> 00:31:09,596
of the size class.

759
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:13,456
But when I'm in this mode when

760
00:31:13,456 --> 00:31:15,816
or when I add Auto Layout

761
00:31:15,816 --> 00:31:18,256
installed only for the

762
00:31:18,256 --> 00:31:20,046
that I'm targeting

763
00:31:20,046 --> 00:31:21,896
So that's important

764
00:31:22,986 --> 00:31:25,316
So again, to prove

765
00:31:25,316 --> 00:31:27,696
through iPhones using the

766
00:31:27,766 --> 00:31:28,746
and the label isn't there.

767
00:31:29,166 --> 00:31:31,896
So I did the right thing I added

768
00:31:31,896 --> 00:31:35,106
for regular width, regular

769
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:39,346
So the next thing we're

770
00:31:39,346 --> 00:31:42,346
to make a more surgical

771
00:31:43,066 --> 00:31:45,396
And as you can see when I cycle

772
00:31:45,396 --> 00:31:48,586
through to an iPhone

773
00:31:48,586 --> 00:31:50,956
between the top label here

774
00:31:50,956 --> 00:31:52,416
Now in fact if I go back

775
00:31:52,416 --> 00:31:54,626
to the design my designer

776
00:31:55,506 --> 00:31:56,526
So how do I do that?

777
00:31:56,646 --> 00:31:58,746
Well what's really cool is

778
00:31:58,746 --> 00:32:01,796
that you can actually customize

779
00:31:58,746 --> 00:32:01,796
that you can actually customize

780
00:32:01,936 --> 00:32:05,806
constant using a variation

781
00:32:06,096 --> 00:32:07,706
by targeting a size class.

782
00:32:08,466 --> 00:32:09,426
So let's do that right now.

783
00:32:09,426 --> 00:32:11,216
So you can see if I

784
00:32:11,496 --> 00:32:14,686
remember I added this

785
00:32:14,686 --> 00:32:19,726
between it and there we go.

786
00:32:20,186 --> 00:32:23,186
Okay, so I've clicked

787
00:32:23,186 --> 00:32:25,576
and I see this Auto Layout

788
00:32:25,576 --> 00:32:26,426
of its attributes here.

789
00:32:27,046 --> 00:32:29,226
You can see the constant

790
00:32:29,226 --> 00:32:31,176
So this is the problem

791
00:32:31,726 --> 00:32:34,116
Well I can actually edit

792
00:32:34,116 --> 00:32:35,756
for iPhones for compact

793
00:32:35,756 --> 00:32:37,406
with regular height

794
00:32:37,926 --> 00:32:40,866
Again, I can click Vary for

795
00:32:41,236 --> 00:32:43,766
and on height and you

796
00:32:43,766 --> 00:32:47,226
of the bar show me iPhones.

797
00:32:48,816 --> 00:32:51,036
But what are all these iPad

798
00:32:51,286 --> 00:32:54,926
Well remember when your user

799
00:32:54,926 --> 00:32:57,256
or split view there's

800
00:32:57,256 --> 00:32:58,946
Your app will be

801
00:32:58,946 --> 00:33:01,236
So you really want to

802
00:32:58,946 --> 00:33:01,236
So you really want to

803
00:33:01,236 --> 00:33:02,396
on iPad in that case.

804
00:33:02,796 --> 00:33:05,496
So this actually makes sense

805
00:33:05,496 --> 00:33:08,346
that you see here

806
00:33:08,346 --> 00:33:09,816
with regular height

807
00:33:09,816 --> 00:33:11,356
So this is good, this

808
00:33:12,186 --> 00:33:15,186
Okay, so I've gone into Vary

809
00:33:15,186 --> 00:33:18,000
and now I can select

810
00:33:23,056 --> 00:33:23,556
There we go.

811
00:33:23,556 --> 00:33:27,956
Now notice I'm going to

812
00:33:27,956 --> 00:33:29,366
and I'm going to draw

813
00:33:29,456 --> 00:33:30,806
to the Attributes Inspector.

814
00:33:31,106 --> 00:33:33,596
So what happens when I

815
00:33:33,596 --> 00:33:34,936
like what happened

816
00:33:34,936 --> 00:33:38,736
for font Interface Builder added

817
00:33:39,066 --> 00:33:41,726
And you can see this is

818
00:33:41,756 --> 00:33:43,026
that I configured in the bar.

819
00:33:43,516 --> 00:33:45,586
So I've changed this --

820
00:33:45,586 --> 00:33:48,376
I've added a customization

821
00:33:48,376 --> 00:33:53,166
by starting an editing

822
00:33:53,166 --> 00:33:55,366
but I'm making the edit

823
00:33:55,766 --> 00:33:56,926
So that's really cool.

824
00:33:57,436 --> 00:34:00,076
And as I cycle through these

825
00:33:57,436 --> 00:34:00,076
And as I cycle through these

826
00:34:00,076 --> 00:34:02,266
but it's still not

827
00:34:02,856 --> 00:34:03,836
So how do I fix this?

828
00:34:04,296 --> 00:34:08,045
Well you might think that I need

829
00:34:08,045 --> 00:34:09,406
and try to make the

830
00:34:09,876 --> 00:34:11,386
And that's not quite

831
00:34:11,766 --> 00:34:13,356
So what's important

832
00:34:13,356 --> 00:34:16,196
when you're varying for traits

833
00:34:16,346 --> 00:34:17,366
based on size class.

834
00:34:17,856 --> 00:34:19,795
But you don't use this

835
00:34:20,295 --> 00:34:23,146
Instead, wouldn't it be nice

836
00:34:23,416 --> 00:34:25,856
that customization in

837
00:34:26,346 --> 00:34:30,186
So I have an iPhone selected

838
00:34:30,186 --> 00:34:33,516
it also knows that I have

839
00:34:34,795 --> 00:34:37,176
So now when I go to edit

840
00:34:37,176 --> 00:34:38,266
out where I want the data to go.

841
00:34:38,416 --> 00:34:41,866
So if I changed 45 to 30

842
00:34:41,866 --> 00:34:44,456
in the Attributes Inspector

843
00:34:44,585 --> 00:34:47,036
for the size class because it

844
00:34:47,196 --> 00:34:47,786
based on that.

845
00:34:48,306 --> 00:34:50,485
So we think this is a really

846
00:34:50,485 --> 00:34:52,846
It lets you introduce

847
00:34:53,436 --> 00:34:54,806
but then you can

848
00:34:54,806 --> 00:34:56,156
in the design canvas directly.

849
00:34:56,156 --> 00:34:59,136
And with that I want to

850
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:04,500
[ Applause ]

851
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:07,736
&gt;&gt; Thank you Brent.

852
00:35:07,876 --> 00:35:08,236
&gt;&gt; Thanks.

853
00:35:09,606 --> 00:35:11,836
&gt;&gt; So I just wanted to

854
00:35:11,946 --> 00:35:14,716
that Brent had talked

855
00:35:14,916 --> 00:35:17,606
So first we introduced the

856
00:35:17,606 --> 00:35:19,926
where you can see

857
00:35:20,316 --> 00:35:22,856
and you can see your application

858
00:35:23,346 --> 00:35:26,126
We also have a new workflow

859
00:35:26,126 --> 00:35:27,706
between the different traits.

860
00:35:28,226 --> 00:35:31,146
So you can do very surgical

861
00:35:31,146 --> 00:35:32,136
Attitudes Inspector.

862
00:35:32,566 --> 00:35:34,196
And the Attributes

863
00:35:34,196 --> 00:35:36,756
where you can see all the

864
00:35:36,756 --> 00:35:39,486
So if you're ever questioning

865
00:35:39,486 --> 00:35:40,626
you can always go

866
00:35:40,626 --> 00:35:42,816
to see what the customizations

867
00:35:43,526 --> 00:35:45,236
But there's also this

868
00:35:45,236 --> 00:35:47,686
where you can do kind of

869
00:35:47,686 --> 00:35:48,656
style changes.

870
00:35:49,226 --> 00:35:51,266
And as Brett mentioned,

871
00:35:51,266 --> 00:35:52,416
to note this mode is important

872
00:35:52,416 --> 00:35:54,806
for introducing new

873
00:35:55,436 --> 00:35:58,206
Once you've exited this mode

874
00:35:58,206 --> 00:36:00,696
know how to update

875
00:35:58,206 --> 00:36:00,696
know how to update

876
00:36:00,696 --> 00:36:03,236
that you've made

877
00:36:03,236 --> 00:36:04,646
that you're currently looking at

878
00:36:04,646 --> 00:36:06,196
and it works really

879
00:36:07,266 --> 00:36:09,506
Now these changes

880
00:36:09,826 --> 00:36:14,096
but these workflow changes

881
00:36:14,096 --> 00:36:15,286
as well in Interface Builder.

882
00:36:17,096 --> 00:36:19,496
So just in summary

883
00:36:19,836 --> 00:36:21,466
So I talked about

884
00:36:21,466 --> 00:36:22,156
of the trait system.

885
00:36:22,156 --> 00:36:24,526
We talked about how traits

886
00:36:24,866 --> 00:36:27,226
how you're going to override

887
00:36:27,226 --> 00:36:29,306
to do all your adaptivity

888
00:36:29,306 --> 00:36:30,806
of the systems that

889
00:36:31,366 --> 00:36:32,546
And that size classes

890
00:36:32,546 --> 00:36:36,466
that describe the experience how

891
00:36:37,466 --> 00:36:39,886
Brett gave you a demo of the

892
00:36:39,886 --> 00:36:41,496
and how Interface

893
00:36:41,496 --> 00:36:44,296
to both see your interface

894
00:36:44,886 --> 00:36:48,486
in concrete devices while

895
00:36:48,486 --> 00:36:50,986
to edit all the underlying

896
00:36:50,986 --> 00:36:52,436
and the traits that you want

897
00:36:52,436 --> 00:36:53,796
to make your application

898
00:36:54,876 --> 00:36:59,336
So this was part 1 and again,

899
00:36:59,336 --> 00:37:02,216
that the system is going to

900
00:36:59,336 --> 00:37:02,216
that the system is going to

901
00:37:02,646 --> 00:37:04,676
There's lots of ways that

902
00:37:04,676 --> 00:37:07,966
as developers take advantage

903
00:37:07,966 --> 00:37:10,056
to see what you guys come up

904
00:37:10,736 --> 00:37:13,076
Now come back tomorrow

905
00:37:13,076 --> 00:37:13,956
to give you even more.

906
00:37:13,956 --> 00:37:17,026
We're going to give you more

907
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:19,386
for making applications

908
00:37:19,386 --> 00:37:21,666
to put it altogether

909
00:37:22,296 --> 00:37:24,796
Besides the session tomorrow

910
00:37:25,046 --> 00:37:27,906
on Auto Layout that you're going

911
00:37:27,906 --> 00:37:30,146
of the improvements we've made

912
00:37:30,146 --> 00:37:31,796
with some of those

913
00:37:32,006 --> 00:37:33,876
And with that have a great

914
00:37:33,876 --> 00:37:34,976
of your week and a great lunch.
