3
00:00:24,136 --> 00:00:26,976
&gt;&gt; Welcome to Mastering

4
00:00:27,706 --> 00:00:28,446
My name's Justin.

5
00:00:28,496 --> 00:00:29,446
I work on UIKit.

6
00:00:29,806 --> 00:00:32,336
And I am here to show you how

7
00:00:32,386 --> 00:00:35,506
and really take your tvOS

8
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:38,276
So to do that, there's

9
00:00:38,276 --> 00:00:39,326
to talk to you about today.

10
00:00:39,446 --> 00:00:40,846
And the first is event handling.

11
00:00:41,326 --> 00:00:43,056
What kind of events is

12
00:00:43,056 --> 00:00:45,646
and what are the best ways for

13
00:00:46,556 --> 00:00:48,246
Then I'd like to talk

14
00:00:48,676 --> 00:00:51,326
This is a user interface

15
00:00:51,326 --> 00:00:55,046
and we'll show you how to

16
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:56,576
Thirdly, we'll talk

17
00:00:56,936 --> 00:00:58,986
Scrolling on tvOS works

18
00:00:58,986 --> 00:00:59,686
than scrolling on iOS.

19
00:00:59,686 --> 00:01:01,546
And we'll show you how

20
00:00:59,686 --> 00:01:01,546
And we'll show you how

21
00:01:01,546 --> 00:01:02,056
of scrolling.

22
00:01:02,056 --> 00:01:05,456
And finally, we'll

23
00:01:05,706 --> 00:01:07,286
and how you can use

24
00:01:07,286 --> 00:01:08,736
to accept text from users.

25
00:01:09,256 --> 00:01:11,436
So let's get started and dive

26
00:01:12,486 --> 00:01:13,836
So when it comes

27
00:01:14,406 --> 00:01:16,606
there are a few overall best

28
00:01:16,606 --> 00:01:17,306
with you right off the bat.

29
00:01:17,936 --> 00:01:21,696
And the first is, is that when

30
00:01:21,696 --> 00:01:24,646
to navigate your application

31
00:01:24,646 --> 00:01:26,506
to another, you don't

32
00:01:26,506 --> 00:01:27,946
of your own event

33
00:01:28,256 --> 00:01:30,606
The focus engine is going take

34
00:01:31,306 --> 00:01:33,966
including handling different

35
00:01:33,966 --> 00:01:36,386
on what kind of input device

36
00:01:36,386 --> 00:01:37,866
So it'll take care of

37
00:01:40,926 --> 00:01:44,026
Secondly, if you decide you do

38
00:01:44,026 --> 00:01:46,336
I recommend that you start

39
00:01:46,656 --> 00:01:48,276
Not only to have a

40
00:01:48,276 --> 00:01:51,316
but it'll also help ensure all

41
00:01:51,316 --> 00:01:52,886
in your app are going

42
00:01:52,886 --> 00:01:54,666
across all the system

43
00:01:57,236 --> 00:01:59,386
And finally, as you are

44
00:01:59,386 --> 00:02:00,746
for your application,

45
00:01:59,386 --> 00:02:00,746
for your application,

46
00:02:00,746 --> 00:02:03,446
that not every input device can

47
00:02:03,726 --> 00:02:06,266
So for example, a user might

48
00:02:06,266 --> 00:02:07,596
to navigate to your application.

49
00:02:07,856 --> 00:02:09,826
And game controllers can't

50
00:02:10,145 --> 00:02:12,776
So you might not want to use

51
00:02:12,776 --> 00:02:13,836
to interact with

52
00:02:13,916 --> 00:02:16,556
So keep that in mind as

53
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:20,386
So speaking of touches,

54
00:02:20,386 --> 00:02:23,376
on tvOS using the touch

55
00:02:23,646 --> 00:02:26,106
And we deliver them to you

56
00:02:26,106 --> 00:02:27,756
that you might recognize

57
00:02:28,226 --> 00:02:30,996
And a touch represents the

58
00:02:31,246 --> 00:02:32,886
and that surface on the remote.

59
00:02:34,936 --> 00:02:36,436
This is just like

60
00:02:36,436 --> 00:02:37,936
It has the location and

61
00:02:37,936 --> 00:02:39,686
that you are used to.

62
00:02:39,956 --> 00:02:41,646
But there is one important

63
00:02:41,646 --> 00:02:43,306
on tvOS and touches on iOS.

64
00:02:43,766 --> 00:02:45,696
A touch on iOS is

65
00:02:45,696 --> 00:02:46,746
onto the user interface.

66
00:02:46,746 --> 00:02:48,936
The user is physically

67
00:02:49,906 --> 00:02:51,286
That's not the case on tvOS.

68
00:02:51,346 --> 00:02:52,946
The user interface

69
00:02:52,946 --> 00:02:54,706
and the user is touching

70
00:02:55,286 --> 00:02:58,356
And so we bucket these into

71
00:02:58,356 --> 00:03:00,346
We say the ones on iOS

72
00:02:58,356 --> 00:03:00,346
We say the ones on iOS

73
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:02,846
and the ones tvOS are

74
00:03:03,226 --> 00:03:05,646
And we have this touch type

75
00:03:05,646 --> 00:03:09,506
to help you tell the difference

76
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:12,696
And because of this indirection,

77
00:03:12,746 --> 00:03:14,036
"What's your location onscreen?"

78
00:03:14,566 --> 00:03:17,916
on a direct touch interface

79
00:03:17,956 --> 00:03:19,946
We give you a location

80
00:03:19,946 --> 00:03:21,296
where the user's

81
00:03:21,956 --> 00:03:23,736
But on tvOS, the user

82
00:03:23,796 --> 00:03:25,716
What location should we

83
00:03:25,896 --> 00:03:28,416
And so what we do in this

84
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,616
where the user's finger

85
00:03:30,616 --> 00:03:32,656
we always deliver the

86
00:03:32,706 --> 00:03:35,526
as if it had begun directly in

87
00:03:35,866 --> 00:03:37,486
And this is really

88
00:03:37,486 --> 00:03:39,926
that any gesture recognizers

89
00:03:39,926 --> 00:03:41,026
that you might have attached

90
00:03:41,026 --> 00:03:43,276
to the focused view will

91
00:03:43,276 --> 00:03:44,316
to participate in the gesture.

92
00:03:44,316 --> 00:03:48,886
One thing that we don't expose

93
00:03:48,886 --> 00:03:50,356
of the user's finger

94
00:03:50,356 --> 00:03:51,916
And there is a few

95
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:53,976
but one of the really important

96
00:03:53,976 --> 00:03:55,706
to discourage pointer-based

97
00:03:55,706 --> 00:03:58,196
We don't want to see

98
00:03:58,196 --> 00:03:59,016
or anything like that.

99
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:01,186
We'd really rather

100
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:01,186
We'd really rather

101
00:04:01,186 --> 00:04:05,386
to the focus interaction

102
00:04:05,496 --> 00:04:08,026
So in addition to touches, there

103
00:04:08,026 --> 00:04:09,886
that you'll get on tvOS; and

104
00:04:10,346 --> 00:04:12,986
And presses are delivered

105
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:16,456
And a press represents an

106
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:17,606
that the user is

107
00:04:18,586 --> 00:04:21,796
And not all of those buttons are

108
00:04:21,796 --> 00:04:23,316
Some buttons, like those

109
00:04:23,316 --> 00:04:24,156
are pressure sensitive.

110
00:04:24,156 --> 00:04:26,446
But we can actually detect how

111
00:04:26,446 --> 00:04:28,336
button, and we can deliver

112
00:04:28,876 --> 00:04:32,816
You can recognize presses

113
00:04:32,816 --> 00:04:34,616
including things like

114
00:04:34,906 --> 00:04:36,626
and LongPressGestureRecognizer.

115
00:04:36,796 --> 00:04:39,746
And we have low-level

116
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:40,706
that follow the same pattern

117
00:04:40,706 --> 00:04:42,076
as a low-level touch

118
00:04:42,116 --> 00:04:44,536
So we have pressesBegan,

119
00:04:44,536 --> 00:04:46,006
as the user begins

120
00:04:46,356 --> 00:04:48,086
We have pressesChanged,

121
00:04:48,086 --> 00:04:49,396
if it's a pressure-sensitive

122
00:04:49,396 --> 00:04:50,786
and the amount of

123
00:04:51,506 --> 00:04:53,666
And we also have pressesEnded

124
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:54,856
And just like touchesCancelled,

125
00:04:54,906 --> 00:04:56,806
yes you really do

126
00:04:57,696 --> 00:04:59,706
There's one thing to

127
00:04:59,846 --> 00:05:01,306
which is that press events

128
00:04:59,846 --> 00:05:01,306
which is that press events

129
00:05:01,306 --> 00:05:03,786
because they don't really have

130
00:05:03,786 --> 00:05:04,866
directly to the focus view.

131
00:05:04,866 --> 00:05:06,976
And they go up the

132
00:05:07,046 --> 00:05:09,146
They won't go to any child

133
00:05:09,146 --> 00:05:11,436
So keep that in mind when

134
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:12,736
to attach gesture

135
00:05:12,976 --> 00:05:16,786
Okay, so we are talking

136
00:05:16,786 --> 00:05:18,626
Let's go through some of the

137
00:05:18,626 --> 00:05:20,826
to you and what buttons

138
00:05:20,826 --> 00:05:21,976
on various input devices.

139
00:05:22,056 --> 00:05:25,946
So I want to show you the

140
00:05:25,946 --> 00:05:27,226
from previous-generation

141
00:05:27,226 --> 00:05:29,806
and I want to show

142
00:05:30,006 --> 00:05:31,206
And I don't have room

143
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:33,146
but keep in mind presses

144
00:05:33,146 --> 00:05:35,546
from programmable

145
00:05:35,546 --> 00:05:36,496
from Bluetooth keyboards.

146
00:05:36,496 --> 00:05:40,506
So there is a lot of

147
00:05:40,536 --> 00:05:42,196
Probably the most common

148
00:05:42,196 --> 00:05:43,406
is UIPressTypeSelect.

149
00:05:43,406 --> 00:05:45,766
And this is the press type that

150
00:05:45,766 --> 00:05:47,726
to activate a control or select

151
00:05:47,726 --> 00:05:49,306
on a CollectionView cell,

152
00:05:49,306 --> 00:05:50,986
And on the Siri remote,

153
00:05:50,986 --> 00:05:52,656
that's the button that's

154
00:05:52,656 --> 00:05:53,616
surface on the remote.

155
00:05:54,836 --> 00:05:56,816
On the Apple remote,

156
00:05:56,816 --> 00:05:58,646
And on game controllers

157
00:05:58,646 --> 00:06:01,636
to generate this press type.

158
00:05:58,646 --> 00:06:01,636
to generate this press type.

159
00:06:01,856 --> 00:06:03,306
Another really common

160
00:06:03,306 --> 00:06:04,466
is UIPressTypeMenu.

161
00:06:04,466 --> 00:06:05,386
And this is the press type

162
00:06:05,386 --> 00:06:07,046
that indicates the

163
00:06:07,306 --> 00:06:09,256
They want to dismiss a

164
00:06:09,256 --> 00:06:11,096
or even dismiss your

165
00:06:11,096 --> 00:06:12,076
and return to the Home screen.

166
00:06:12,656 --> 00:06:14,596
And in all three of

167
00:06:14,596 --> 00:06:16,176
that'll be the button

168
00:06:17,516 --> 00:06:20,296
And on game controllers, we

169
00:06:20,716 --> 00:06:24,696
And finally, there is

170
00:06:24,896 --> 00:06:27,766
And this is obviously useful

171
00:06:27,946 --> 00:06:29,676
but it can also be used

172
00:06:29,676 --> 00:06:30,676
in addition to Select.

173
00:06:30,676 --> 00:06:33,346
So if the users focus

174
00:06:33,606 --> 00:06:36,106
pressing the Select button might

175
00:06:36,276 --> 00:06:37,896
But pressing Play/Pause

176
00:06:37,896 --> 00:06:38,416
into playback.

177
00:06:39,236 --> 00:06:41,676
And so that's the

178
00:06:41,676 --> 00:06:43,656
or the button that has

179
00:06:43,656 --> 00:06:45,606
And on game controllers

180
00:06:45,606 --> 00:06:47,036
to generate that press type.

181
00:06:48,506 --> 00:06:49,536
Okay, so to round things

182
00:06:49,536 --> 00:06:50,916
out there is just a

183
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:52,696
and these are directional

184
00:06:52,696 --> 00:06:55,366
So we have up, down, left,

185
00:06:55,366 --> 00:06:56,166
that can be generated.

186
00:06:56,216 --> 00:06:59,766
On the Apple remote we use

187
00:06:59,766 --> 00:07:02,506
On game controllers there is

188
00:06:59,766 --> 00:07:02,506
On game controllers there is

189
00:07:02,506 --> 00:07:04,286
So we'll use the D pad.

190
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:07,256
We'll also use the

191
00:07:07,256 --> 00:07:09,196
And we'll even generate left

192
00:07:09,196 --> 00:07:10,976
and right presses using

193
00:07:10,976 --> 00:07:11,646
on the game controller.

194
00:07:12,796 --> 00:07:14,556
Now there aren't any

195
00:07:14,556 --> 00:07:16,526
for these arrows on the serial

196
00:07:16,526 --> 00:07:18,096
that it's not possible

197
00:07:18,096 --> 00:07:19,086
but that's actually not true.

198
00:07:19,486 --> 00:07:22,016
If you do a touch tap you

199
00:07:22,016 --> 00:07:23,576
down on the Select

200
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:25,706
on these four cardinal

201
00:07:26,086 --> 00:07:27,306
Then UIKit will detect that

202
00:07:27,306 --> 00:07:29,246
and actually generate

203
00:07:29,246 --> 00:07:31,566
And this is a really

204
00:07:31,566 --> 00:07:33,946
through your user interface

205
00:07:34,326 --> 00:07:36,486
So just because the user

206
00:07:36,596 --> 00:07:38,406
that doesn't mean that they

207
00:07:38,676 --> 00:07:42,916
Okay, so I promised you that

208
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:43,636
to recognize these.

209
00:07:43,636 --> 00:07:45,136
And I won't go through these

210
00:07:45,136 --> 00:07:46,426
to show you a few

211
00:07:46,796 --> 00:07:48,236
You know, we can use the

212
00:07:48,236 --> 00:07:49,056
on the top.

213
00:07:49,286 --> 00:07:51,706
We can even do a long press

214
00:07:51,706 --> 00:07:53,566
into the editing mode

215
00:07:53,736 --> 00:07:56,006
And there at the bottom I

216
00:07:56,006 --> 00:07:56,726
of taps required.

217
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:59,036
So now I am listening for a

218
00:08:01,766 --> 00:08:04,466
Okay, let's talk about

219
00:08:04,466 --> 00:08:05,626
and that's the Menu button.

220
00:08:06,656 --> 00:08:09,776
The Menu button has some

221
00:08:09,776 --> 00:08:11,086
It kind of has to

222
00:08:11,486 --> 00:08:13,166
Not only does it need

223
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:14,906
of your application,

224
00:08:14,906 --> 00:08:17,216
like dismiss view

225
00:08:17,216 --> 00:08:18,606
of a UINavigationController.

226
00:08:18,946 --> 00:08:20,836
But it also needs to have

227
00:08:20,836 --> 00:08:23,216
And eventually your

228
00:08:23,216 --> 00:08:25,566
be dismissed so the user can

229
00:08:25,866 --> 00:08:27,416
And your user is going

230
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:28,256
if that's not possible.

231
00:08:28,636 --> 00:08:29,966
And we can think that

232
00:08:29,966 --> 00:08:32,635
that this is something that App

233
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:34,626
So if your application

234
00:08:34,626 --> 00:08:36,806
by pressing the Menu button,

235
00:08:36,866 --> 00:08:39,535
And we don't want

236
00:08:39,535 --> 00:08:41,826
So how does this work?

237
00:08:41,826 --> 00:08:44,636
How do we get it so that the

238
00:08:44,636 --> 00:08:46,506
by your application but

239
00:08:46,886 --> 00:08:49,406
Well the technical thing

240
00:08:49,406 --> 00:08:51,616
for your app to gracefully

241
00:08:51,616 --> 00:08:54,506
to the Home screen is that when

242
00:08:54,586 --> 00:08:56,896
the pressesEnded event

243
00:08:56,896 --> 00:08:59,186
up the responder chain if you

244
00:08:59,396 --> 00:09:01,726
If that doesn't happen, your

245
00:08:59,396 --> 00:09:01,726
If that doesn't happen, your

246
00:09:02,596 --> 00:09:04,216
Now sometimes that's

247
00:09:04,216 --> 00:09:06,206
So if you are deep into

248
00:09:06,206 --> 00:09:07,966
and the user presses the

249
00:09:07,966 --> 00:09:09,386
to resign your app; they

250
00:09:09,386 --> 00:09:10,496
to the previous view controller.

251
00:09:11,016 --> 00:09:13,596
So in that case, there might be

252
00:09:13,596 --> 00:09:14,616
listening for the Menu button.

253
00:09:14,676 --> 00:09:17,086
And if that recognizer

254
00:09:17,086 --> 00:09:19,316
it'll send pressesCancelled

255
00:09:19,316 --> 00:09:21,446
And in that case the

256
00:09:21,446 --> 00:09:23,636
and then UINavigationController

257
00:09:23,636 --> 00:09:24,226
that view controller.

258
00:09:24,596 --> 00:09:26,776
So it's okay to not

259
00:09:26,776 --> 00:09:27,456
to your application.

260
00:09:27,496 --> 00:09:30,346
You just need to make sure that

261
00:09:30,346 --> 00:09:33,326
at the appropriate time.

262
00:09:33,526 --> 00:09:35,306
So to do this correctly,

263
00:09:35,306 --> 00:09:36,676
that you start with

264
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:38,286
And when you no longer

265
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:40,256
in handling the Menu

266
00:09:40,256 --> 00:09:41,676
that GestureRecognizer

267
00:09:42,266 --> 00:09:43,606
And so one way to do

268
00:09:43,606 --> 00:09:46,466
GestureRecognizer from the view.

269
00:09:46,466 --> 00:09:47,506
You also disable the gesture.

270
00:09:47,506 --> 00:09:49,536
So gesture recognizers have

271
00:09:49,536 --> 00:09:50,536
And if you set that to false,

272
00:09:50,536 --> 00:09:51,806
then the gesture will

273
00:09:51,866 --> 00:09:54,776
And if you don't want to

274
00:09:54,776 --> 00:09:57,386
there is UIGestureRecognizer

275
00:09:57,386 --> 00:09:58,736
gestureRecognizerShouldBegin.

276
00:09:59,086 --> 00:10:01,226
And you can implement this,

277
00:09:59,086 --> 00:10:01,226
And you can implement this,

278
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:02,756
of the Menu button you

279
00:10:02,756 --> 00:10:04,676
to decide right then

280
00:10:04,676 --> 00:10:05,336
to handle the gesture.

281
00:10:07,176 --> 00:10:09,066
If you are implementing the

282
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:12,316
methods, in your pressesEnded

283
00:10:12,316 --> 00:10:13,686
or not you want to

284
00:10:13,866 --> 00:10:16,426
And if you do want to handle the

285
00:10:16,676 --> 00:10:19,336
But if you are not going to

286
00:10:19,336 --> 00:10:21,536
that you do call super so

287
00:10:21,536 --> 00:10:22,376
up the responder chain

288
00:10:22,376 --> 00:10:25,196
and UIApplication has the

289
00:10:26,406 --> 00:10:27,736
Finally, if you are

290
00:10:27,736 --> 00:10:29,826
it's common that you only

291
00:10:29,826 --> 00:10:30,986
which is the one

292
00:10:31,496 --> 00:10:33,286
And so in that case

293
00:10:33,286 --> 00:10:34,786
at using GCEventViewController.

294
00:10:34,896 --> 00:10:36,146
Now it has this property,

295
00:10:36,146 --> 00:10:37,796
controllerUser

296
00:10:38,306 --> 00:10:40,766
And what this does is that

297
00:10:40,766 --> 00:10:42,226
through your app using

298
00:10:42,526 --> 00:10:44,636
not only are events going to

299
00:10:44,636 --> 00:10:46,136
which you are probably

300
00:10:46,556 --> 00:10:48,486
But they also can

301
00:10:48,486 --> 00:10:49,706
like these presses

302
00:10:50,006 --> 00:10:51,316
And when you are in the

303
00:10:51,316 --> 00:10:52,336
you are probably not interested

304
00:10:52,336 --> 00:10:54,226
in receiving the UIKit

305
00:10:54,256 --> 00:10:56,416
So if you set controllerUser

306
00:10:56,736 --> 00:11:00,746
to false during your game

307
00:10:56,736 --> 00:11:00,746
to false during your game

308
00:11:00,746 --> 00:11:03,186
the Menu button won't

309
00:11:03,186 --> 00:11:04,676
And instead you'll

310
00:11:04,676 --> 00:11:05,696
and take care of it on your own.

311
00:11:05,696 --> 00:11:08,676
But when the user gets back

312
00:11:08,676 --> 00:11:10,176
you are going to want

313
00:11:10,176 --> 00:11:11,956
so that pressing the Menu button

314
00:11:13,476 --> 00:11:15,546
So that is event handling.

315
00:11:16,216 --> 00:11:20,156
Let's talk now about

316
00:11:20,156 --> 00:11:22,596
Layered images are this user

317
00:11:22,596 --> 00:11:23,616
unique to tvOS.

318
00:11:24,196 --> 00:11:25,946
And there are these images

319
00:11:25,946 --> 00:11:27,246
that you've probably

320
00:11:27,796 --> 00:11:30,966
And they can have up to

321
00:11:30,966 --> 00:11:32,866
a parallaxing content

322
00:11:32,986 --> 00:11:35,856
And these are required

323
00:11:35,856 --> 00:11:38,416
So your application

324
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:39,666
at a minimum of two layers.

325
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:41,706
So you'll have to be at least a

326
00:11:41,706 --> 00:11:45,566
if you are going to be on

327
00:11:45,566 --> 00:11:48,266
As the user moves their finger

328
00:11:48,646 --> 00:11:51,726
the image moves in

329
00:11:51,726 --> 00:11:53,136
And this is more

330
00:11:53,456 --> 00:11:55,006
This helps the user to realize

331
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:57,106
that their inputs are being

332
00:11:57,106 --> 00:11:59,356
to anticipate focus

333
00:12:00,746 --> 00:12:02,076
And they're animated.

334
00:12:02,076 --> 00:12:04,606
So they have a lot of great

335
00:12:04,606 --> 00:12:06,056
especially like when

336
00:12:06,426 --> 00:12:09,286
And we'll show you how you can

337
00:12:09,286 --> 00:12:13,476
to really make your

338
00:12:13,476 --> 00:12:14,906
Okay, so let's talk

339
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:19,716
So the video that I just showed

340
00:12:19,716 --> 00:12:21,236
And if the UIImageView

341
00:12:21,236 --> 00:12:22,536
then it'll automatically

342
00:12:22,536 --> 00:12:24,616
that great floating appearance

343
00:12:24,616 --> 00:12:26,826
if you have a layered image

344
00:12:27,376 --> 00:12:28,196
But it's often the case

345
00:12:28,196 --> 00:12:30,576
that a UI image is not the

346
00:12:30,576 --> 00:12:31,246
becoming focused.

347
00:12:31,246 --> 00:12:34,846
Images are typically a

348
00:12:34,846 --> 00:12:36,286
and in that case the

349
00:12:36,286 --> 00:12:37,016
to become focused.

350
00:12:37,466 --> 00:12:38,996
So how do we get this

351
00:12:38,996 --> 00:12:40,756
if the image isn't

352
00:12:41,126 --> 00:12:42,366
Well it doesn't have

353
00:12:42,776 --> 00:12:43,986
We have this property

354
00:12:43,986 --> 00:12:46,136
to UIImageView called

355
00:12:46,136 --> 00:12:47,246
WhenAncestorfocused.

356
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:50,426
And if you set this to be

357
00:12:50,426 --> 00:12:51,746
of the image becomes focused,

358
00:12:51,746 --> 00:12:53,106
then the image will

359
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:53,986
that floating appearance

360
00:12:53,986 --> 00:12:55,466
and begin reacting

361
00:12:55,976 --> 00:12:59,746
And these images can also

362
00:12:59,746 --> 00:13:00,906
And so this is slightly

363
00:12:59,746 --> 00:13:00,906
And so this is slightly

364
00:13:00,906 --> 00:13:02,646
than the normal default state,

365
00:13:02,646 --> 00:13:04,426
where they are sitting

366
00:13:04,776 --> 00:13:06,626
They kind of have this sort

367
00:13:06,626 --> 00:13:08,366
as if the user is

368
00:13:09,266 --> 00:13:11,006
And you can trigger

369
00:13:11,006 --> 00:13:13,286
by setting the isHighlighted

370
00:13:13,556 --> 00:13:15,656
to be either true or

371
00:13:15,656 --> 00:13:16,656
on or off that effect.

372
00:13:16,736 --> 00:13:19,996
And you might want to do

373
00:13:19,996 --> 00:13:22,116
when the user starts pressing

374
00:13:22,946 --> 00:13:25,606
But there are a few cases

375
00:13:25,606 --> 00:13:27,166
and you won't have to

376
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:29,756
And those are images that are

377
00:13:29,856 --> 00:13:32,926
and images that are

378
00:13:33,016 --> 00:13:35,416
In those cases you don't have

379
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:36,686
at all; we'll take

380
00:13:37,206 --> 00:13:40,396
Okay, so we talked

381
00:13:40,396 --> 00:13:43,266
So let's look at that

382
00:13:43,436 --> 00:13:45,106
So one of the things

383
00:13:45,106 --> 00:13:46,596
when these images become,

384
00:13:46,596 --> 00:13:48,556
in their floating

385
00:13:48,746 --> 00:13:49,736
or they look like

386
00:13:49,736 --> 00:13:51,466
And you might have to

387
00:13:51,466 --> 00:13:52,996
You might want to move

388
00:13:52,996 --> 00:13:55,536
like you have a label

389
00:13:56,186 --> 00:13:58,796
And you can constrain

390
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:00,656
So, you know, if I have

391
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:00,656
So, you know, if I have

392
00:14:00,886 --> 00:14:02,226
let's say that I have

393
00:14:02,226 --> 00:14:04,596
to be the same size

394
00:14:04,856 --> 00:14:07,006
Then you can constrain to

395
00:14:07,006 --> 00:14:09,256
But when it becomes enlarged,

396
00:14:09,256 --> 00:14:11,556
but the visible extent

397
00:14:11,556 --> 00:14:14,966
And so to find out how

398
00:14:14,966 --> 00:14:15,776
when it becomes focused,

399
00:14:15,776 --> 00:14:18,056
we expose this layout guide

400
00:14:18,346 --> 00:14:20,246
And you can attach

401
00:14:20,246 --> 00:14:23,486
to that layout guide, and that

402
00:14:23,486 --> 00:14:25,406
enough away from the image that

403
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:26,366
when it becomes larger.

404
00:14:26,796 --> 00:14:28,826
So let's run through this.

405
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:31,236
So I have my ImageView here,

406
00:14:31,236 --> 00:14:33,256
that represents the

407
00:14:33,256 --> 00:14:37,576
And when it becomes focused

408
00:14:37,576 --> 00:14:39,496
but the frame is still

409
00:14:39,966 --> 00:14:42,826
And so now this dotted

410
00:14:42,876 --> 00:14:44,586
where the focusedFrameGuide is.

411
00:14:44,586 --> 00:14:46,466
And that focusedFrameGuide

412
00:14:46,466 --> 00:14:48,086
even if it's not

413
00:14:48,086 --> 00:14:49,906
And so you can choose

414
00:14:49,906 --> 00:14:51,146
to attach your layout

415
00:14:52,436 --> 00:14:54,666
Or you may choose to change

416
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:56,306
which constraints are

417
00:14:56,306 --> 00:14:57,846
or not the element

418
00:14:57,846 --> 00:15:00,626
And if you do that you should

419
00:14:57,846 --> 00:15:00,626
And if you do that you should

420
00:15:00,626 --> 00:15:03,366
that we expose on the focus

421
00:15:03,366 --> 00:15:05,866
that the animation happens in

422
00:15:06,546 --> 00:15:08,766
The system animation has a

423
00:15:08,766 --> 00:15:10,226
of what exactly the timing is.

424
00:15:10,226 --> 00:15:12,466
It depends on how quickly

425
00:15:12,466 --> 00:15:14,516
or how far off-screen

426
00:15:14,516 --> 00:15:15,716
at the moment it became focused.

427
00:15:15,716 --> 00:15:18,466
So it's not really possible to

428
00:15:18,466 --> 00:15:21,006
You are going to need to use the

429
00:15:21,006 --> 00:15:23,196
that your animations will

430
00:15:23,386 --> 00:15:24,516
And to show you how to do that,

431
00:15:24,516 --> 00:15:26,486
I'd like to invite Randy

432
00:15:26,696 --> 00:15:26,976
Randy?

433
00:15:27,516 --> 00:15:31,546
[ Applause ]

434
00:15:32,046 --> 00:15:32,616
&gt;&gt; Thank you Justin.

435
00:15:33,386 --> 00:15:34,616
So today I am going to walk

436
00:15:34,616 --> 00:15:36,786
through those two

437
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,266
with adding interactivity

438
00:15:39,786 --> 00:15:42,626
And first we are going

439
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:44,216
And second we are going to look

440
00:15:44,216 --> 00:15:45,916
at a custom collection

441
00:15:46,256 --> 00:15:49,446
So to get started, I have got

442
00:15:49,446 --> 00:15:51,806
with an asset catalog that

443
00:15:51,836 --> 00:15:56,036
And I just have a

444
00:15:56,316 --> 00:15:58,986
And we are going to

445
00:16:03,146 --> 00:16:09,286
into the canvas and inspect

446
00:16:17,496 --> 00:16:18,666
And we'll delete its title.

447
00:16:22,046 --> 00:16:23,416
And then we'll add a

448
00:16:24,716 --> 00:16:26,706
to center it horizontally

449
00:16:27,266 --> 00:16:31,896
And then we'll update

450
00:16:32,186 --> 00:16:33,486
to match those constraints.

451
00:16:33,486 --> 00:16:35,496
You can do that with

452
00:16:35,856 --> 00:16:38,736
but I usually the keyboard

453
00:16:40,156 --> 00:16:43,456
And if you look closely,

454
00:16:43,456 --> 00:16:45,466
of extra space around

455
00:16:46,156 --> 00:16:48,276
Those are the edge

456
00:16:48,276 --> 00:16:50,076
We don't want those, so

457
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:54,706
So that looks about

458
00:16:54,706 --> 00:16:57,566
So we'll build and run

459
00:16:57,926 --> 00:17:00,296
Now I am using the

460
00:16:57,926 --> 00:17:00,296
Now I am using the

461
00:17:00,296 --> 00:17:02,186
but I have paired a

462
00:17:02,936 --> 00:17:04,826
so you can get a good feel

463
00:17:04,826 --> 00:17:07,066
for how the interaction

464
00:17:08,126 --> 00:17:11,476
And my finger is pressing

465
00:17:11,695 --> 00:17:13,996
but it's just doing this

466
00:17:13,996 --> 00:17:15,616
of doing that sort

467
00:17:15,976 --> 00:17:17,796
And when I move my

468
00:17:17,796 --> 00:17:19,195
it doesn't react to my touch.

469
00:17:19,695 --> 00:17:20,556
So let's make that better.

470
00:17:22,326 --> 00:17:26,486
To do that, I am going to

471
00:17:26,695 --> 00:17:30,766
for our ViewController

472
00:17:30,766 --> 00:17:32,136
out an outlet for the button.

473
00:17:36,526 --> 00:17:37,966
And then in viewDidLoad,

474
00:17:38,136 --> 00:17:41,486
I am going to grab the

475
00:17:47,136 --> 00:17:49,496
And I want to turn on that

476
00:17:49,496 --> 00:17:53,596
about adjustsImage

477
00:17:56,156 --> 00:18:00,236
And now if I build and

478
00:17:56,156 --> 00:18:00,236
And now if I build and

479
00:18:00,236 --> 00:18:04,086
that the button responds

480
00:18:04,086 --> 00:18:07,626
And it pushes in

481
00:18:07,896 --> 00:18:09,456
But we still have an issue

482
00:18:09,456 --> 00:18:10,466
of this button are clipped.

483
00:18:11,286 --> 00:18:13,066
And that's because by default,

484
00:18:13,646 --> 00:18:17,026
the button's ImageView has

485
00:18:17,806 --> 00:18:18,836
So we just turn that off.

486
00:18:19,956 --> 00:18:20,856
Build and run again.

487
00:18:21,286 --> 00:18:23,406
We should get exactly

488
00:18:23,486 --> 00:18:27,696
It's a great interactive

489
00:18:27,696 --> 00:18:29,746
around with my finger

490
00:18:29,746 --> 00:18:32,076
when I press on it, great.

491
00:18:33,016 --> 00:18:34,526
Let's do something a

492
00:18:34,636 --> 00:18:38,446
I have another project here,

493
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:42,096
and this one has a

494
00:18:42,096 --> 00:18:44,166
subclass in it.

495
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:48,736
And I have gone ahead and

496
00:18:48,736 --> 00:18:50,646
of the CollectionView according

497
00:18:50,646 --> 00:18:52,766
to the Human Interface

498
00:18:52,766 --> 00:18:53,966
for a six-column layout.

499
00:18:54,806 --> 00:18:57,886
Those guidelines tell us we

500
00:18:58,546 --> 00:19:02,176
And I know, based on my designs,

501
00:18:58,546 --> 00:19:02,176
And I know, based on my designs,

502
00:19:02,326 --> 00:19:03,736
for the content of the cells.

503
00:19:03,736 --> 00:19:05,366
And the guidelines tell us

504
00:19:05,366 --> 00:19:07,416
for a six-column

505
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:10,356
between cells horizontally

506
00:19:10,356 --> 00:19:11,466
between cells vertically.

507
00:19:11,876 --> 00:19:15,276
And finally, to stay within

508
00:19:15,276 --> 00:19:17,746
of TVs, we want to leave 60

509
00:19:17,946 --> 00:19:19,466
and 90 points on the

510
00:19:19,466 --> 00:19:21,456
And those numbers are

511
00:19:21,996 --> 00:19:24,326
So let's take a look

512
00:19:24,326 --> 00:19:29,436
I have already given it a custom

513
00:19:29,556 --> 00:19:32,616
And we are going to

514
00:19:32,616 --> 00:19:36,196
and add some custom subviews.

515
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:39,886
First we'll drag

516
00:19:46,046 --> 00:19:47,156
And then we'll drag out a label.

517
00:19:53,056 --> 00:19:55,826
Now I'll add some constraints

518
00:19:55,876 --> 00:19:59,396
We want the ImageView to hug

519
00:19:59,966 --> 00:20:01,356
And we happen to know that all

520
00:19:59,966 --> 00:20:01,356
And we happen to know that all

521
00:20:01,356 --> 00:20:03,876
of our images have

522
00:20:03,876 --> 00:20:06,226
So I'll also add an

523
00:20:06,226 --> 00:20:09,826
And then I'll edit that

524
00:20:09,826 --> 00:20:12,166
to match our images so they

525
00:20:13,876 --> 00:20:15,936
And then I'll add some

526
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:18,856
I'll Control-Drag from

527
00:20:18,936 --> 00:20:22,336
to add a horizontal

528
00:20:22,636 --> 00:20:28,096
And then I also want

529
00:20:28,096 --> 00:20:31,276
of my label will be 15 points

530
00:20:31,446 --> 00:20:33,886
So I'll add a constraint

531
00:20:34,116 --> 00:20:38,346
Now that we have added

532
00:20:38,346 --> 00:20:40,706
we can do Command Option

533
00:20:40,706 --> 00:20:43,066
where it's supposed to be.

534
00:20:43,276 --> 00:20:45,856
And finally, that font

535
00:20:45,856 --> 00:20:49,886
So I am going to bump it up

536
00:20:51,206 --> 00:20:55,696
And we've got some outlets for

537
00:20:55,986 --> 00:20:57,926
So we'll just hook

538
00:20:57,926 --> 00:21:02,376
Now we'll take a quick look at

539
00:20:57,926 --> 00:21:02,376
Now we'll take a quick look at

540
00:21:02,456 --> 00:21:04,676
You can see I have just

541
00:21:04,676 --> 00:21:06,886
in section, and cellForItemAt

542
00:21:07,646 --> 00:21:13,046
So if I build and run, we should

543
00:21:13,046 --> 00:21:13,536
looking for.

544
00:21:14,146 --> 00:21:15,976
But we'll see what

545
00:21:20,216 --> 00:21:22,356
So this is pretty much the

546
00:21:22,356 --> 00:21:23,686
It's all the right things.

547
00:21:23,686 --> 00:21:26,566
But right away you can't

548
00:21:26,566 --> 00:21:29,836
And when I click, you can't

549
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:33,966
So let's take care

550
00:21:34,926 --> 00:21:38,886
Now first, to see where the

551
00:21:39,196 --> 00:21:42,316
into Interface Builder and

552
00:21:42,316 --> 00:21:44,816
that adjustImagewhenfocused

553
00:21:45,136 --> 00:21:50,026
And that'll be enough

554
00:21:50,026 --> 00:21:51,746
to start responding to focus.

555
00:21:52,366 --> 00:21:55,376
As you can see, it's big,

556
00:21:55,376 --> 00:21:56,906
and when I click it pushes in.

557
00:21:57,656 --> 00:21:59,766
But the labels are

558
00:21:59,766 --> 00:22:03,006
They are not responding to

559
00:21:59,766 --> 00:22:03,006
They are not responding to

560
00:22:03,006 --> 00:22:06,186
So to do something about

561
00:22:06,186 --> 00:22:10,276
up our custom cell class

562
00:22:10,776 --> 00:22:16,016
And first we are going

563
00:22:16,016 --> 00:22:19,256
for that vertical constraint

564
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:20,476
and the bottom of the ImageView.

565
00:22:21,586 --> 00:22:24,126
So we'll add an outlet

566
00:22:24,126 --> 00:22:28,316
that the unfocusedConstraint.

567
00:22:34,116 --> 00:22:35,056
And then I'll add

568
00:22:38,886 --> 00:22:40,526
for the focusedConstraint.

569
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:44,816
We'll set that focusedConstraint

570
00:22:48,036 --> 00:22:50,596
to be the labels.topAnchor

571
00:23:00,356 --> 00:23:06,686
relative to the imageView's

572
00:23:07,846 --> 00:23:09,016
plus those 15 points.

573
00:23:12,426 --> 00:23:19,876
Then in updateConstraints

574
00:23:20,406 --> 00:23:24,896
we'll make the focusedConstraint

575
00:23:25,646 --> 00:23:29,206
And we'll make the

576
00:23:29,876 --> 00:23:32,576
in the opposite case.

577
00:23:34,236 --> 00:23:38,226
Finally, in didUpdateFocus,

578
00:23:38,226 --> 00:23:41,436
by calling

579
00:23:41,936 --> 00:23:44,716
And then we'll add a

580
00:23:45,556 --> 00:23:48,336
by calling

581
00:23:49,986 --> 00:23:54,636
And inside there, we'll

582
00:24:02,046 --> 00:24:04,946
And that'll be enough that

583
00:24:06,756 --> 00:24:11,846
we should see the label has

584
00:24:11,846 --> 00:24:13,946
of the focused poster.

585
00:24:14,626 --> 00:24:19,896
And when I move from one to

586
00:24:19,896 --> 00:24:22,406
out of the way and back

587
00:24:23,416 --> 00:24:23,686
Great!

[ Applause ]

596
00:24:46,086 --> 00:24:47,076
&gt;&gt; Thanks for that

597
00:24:47,076 --> 00:24:49,496
So you can see how easy it

598
00:24:49,496 --> 00:24:51,186
of this unique user

599
00:24:51,186 --> 00:24:52,916
to really bring your

600
00:24:52,916 --> 00:24:55,456
All right, let's change

601
00:24:55,456 --> 00:24:56,756
and talk about scrolling.

602
00:24:57,296 --> 00:25:00,766
So scrolling on tvOS is a bit

603
00:24:57,296 --> 00:25:00,766
So scrolling on tvOS is a bit

604
00:25:00,826 --> 00:25:02,686
And it has to do with

605
00:25:03,296 --> 00:25:06,026
So when the user is scrolling

606
00:25:06,026 --> 00:25:07,576
they are physically

607
00:25:07,576 --> 00:25:09,766
And as they move their finger,

608
00:25:09,766 --> 00:25:11,756
of the ScrollView to match

609
00:25:12,436 --> 00:25:14,856
But that's not really

610
00:25:14,856 --> 00:25:16,846
On tvOS, you are not

611
00:25:17,076 --> 00:25:19,246
but you are also not

612
00:25:19,246 --> 00:25:19,936
views directly.

613
00:25:19,996 --> 00:25:21,616
What you are really doing is

614
00:25:21,616 --> 00:25:22,316
focused item.

615
00:25:22,736 --> 00:25:25,706
Then as the focus item changes,

616
00:25:25,706 --> 00:25:28,196
that and it will automatically

617
00:25:28,196 --> 00:25:30,416
as needed to make sure that

618
00:25:30,416 --> 00:25:31,026
be onscreen.

619
00:25:33,756 --> 00:25:36,356
The focus engine will choose

620
00:25:36,356 --> 00:25:37,826
for you based on

621
00:25:37,826 --> 00:25:38,736
and the size of the ScrollView.

622
00:25:38,736 --> 00:25:40,886
But there are some times

623
00:25:40,886 --> 00:25:42,906
of what offset that it's

624
00:25:42,906 --> 00:25:45,416
So for example, one common

625
00:25:45,416 --> 00:25:47,926
to do is they want to that the

626
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:49,056
within the bounds

627
00:25:49,446 --> 00:25:50,616
And you can do that.

628
00:25:50,616 --> 00:25:51,516
And the way you can do that is

629
00:25:51,516 --> 00:25:53,986
with the UIScrollViewDelegate

630
00:25:53,986 --> 00:25:56,986
from iOS which is

631
00:25:56,986 --> 00:25:59,026
withVelocity,

632
00:25:59,556 --> 00:26:02,046
And the final parameter there,

633
00:25:59,556 --> 00:26:02,046
And the final parameter there,

634
00:26:02,046 --> 00:26:03,786
is a pointer to a CGPoint.

635
00:26:04,536 --> 00:26:07,086
And that point represents

636
00:26:07,086 --> 00:26:08,546
that the focus engine

637
00:26:08,546 --> 00:26:10,406
to if you don't do

638
00:26:10,406 --> 00:26:12,256
That's the offset that it

639
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:15,526
But if you'd like to do your

640
00:26:15,526 --> 00:26:16,956
for yourself what you

641
00:26:16,956 --> 00:26:18,336
to be, you can do that.

642
00:26:18,336 --> 00:26:20,146
Make your calculation about

643
00:26:20,376 --> 00:26:23,466
and then store the value

644
00:26:23,466 --> 00:26:24,286
to you by that pointer.

645
00:26:24,286 --> 00:26:26,136
And then the focus engine

646
00:26:26,216 --> 00:26:28,076
And you'll get all the great

647
00:26:28,076 --> 00:26:29,626
with that, but to

648
00:26:31,476 --> 00:26:33,886
But it's not to say that direct

649
00:26:33,886 --> 00:26:35,726
or is never a good idea on tvOS.

650
00:26:35,726 --> 00:26:38,206
There are some cases where

651
00:26:38,206 --> 00:26:41,186
And so some of the situations

652
00:26:41,186 --> 00:26:42,836
like you have a lot of

653
00:26:42,906 --> 00:26:44,396
Maybe you have full-screen

654
00:26:44,396 --> 00:26:46,556
where the photos go completely

655
00:26:47,136 --> 00:26:49,536
So one example from UIKit

656
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:51,246
When you have a

657
00:26:51,246 --> 00:26:52,536
it doesn't do the

658
00:26:52,536 --> 00:26:54,846
And instead, you are directly

659
00:26:54,846 --> 00:26:56,126
content of the

660
00:26:56,126 --> 00:26:58,916
There are other cases where you

661
00:26:58,916 --> 00:27:00,146
So it's another good

662
00:26:58,916 --> 00:27:00,146
So it's another good

663
00:27:00,146 --> 00:27:01,156
to do direct manipulation.

664
00:27:01,506 --> 00:27:03,886
Basically, anytime where

665
00:27:03,886 --> 00:27:06,546
to be the focused item,

666
00:27:06,546 --> 00:27:08,326
to see what the next

667
00:27:08,646 --> 00:27:10,546
and those are good situations

668
00:27:10,936 --> 00:27:12,646
So if you want to do

669
00:27:12,646 --> 00:27:14,346
to write your own

670
00:27:14,346 --> 00:27:15,676
You can reuse the pan gesture

671
00:27:15,676 --> 00:27:16,946
that already comes

672
00:27:17,596 --> 00:27:20,946
The trick is that scroll views

673
00:27:20,946 --> 00:27:22,806
for direct touches

674
00:27:23,276 --> 00:27:25,856
And the Siri remote is

675
00:27:25,856 --> 00:27:27,986
So you just need to get

676
00:27:27,986 --> 00:27:31,386
and convince it to listen

677
00:27:31,386 --> 00:27:33,916
We also have a directional

678
00:27:33,916 --> 00:27:35,546
which is only on

679
00:27:35,546 --> 00:27:37,506
And this is listening for

680
00:27:37,836 --> 00:27:39,996
So that way a user who

681
00:27:39,996 --> 00:27:42,896
that he can do touch input

682
00:27:42,946 --> 00:27:44,866
And this gesture is

683
00:27:44,866 --> 00:27:46,726
because we would rather have

684
00:27:46,726 --> 00:27:48,846
focus instead of manipulating

685
00:27:48,846 --> 00:27:49,726
So you'll have to enable it.

686
00:27:49,726 --> 00:27:52,016
And this is the code

687
00:27:52,016 --> 00:27:52,966
to do both of those things.

688
00:27:53,356 --> 00:27:54,526
So we are getting

689
00:27:54,526 --> 00:27:56,106
to panGestureRecognizer

690
00:27:56,106 --> 00:27:57,346
And we are telling it that we'd

691
00:27:57,346 --> 00:27:58,626
like to listen for

692
00:27:58,726 --> 00:28:00,076
And we are getting

693
00:27:58,726 --> 00:28:00,076
And we are getting

694
00:28:00,076 --> 00:28:01,496
that directionalPressGesture

695
00:28:01,496 --> 00:28:02,936
and we are telling it

696
00:28:02,936 --> 00:28:06,056
And if you do this, then all

697
00:28:06,056 --> 00:28:09,176
into the ScrollView will

698
00:28:09,176 --> 00:28:09,666
of the ScrollView.

699
00:28:09,726 --> 00:28:11,406
And it's actually possible

700
00:28:11,406 --> 00:28:14,056
to combine this direct

701
00:28:14,056 --> 00:28:15,466
and the focus interaction

702
00:28:15,616 --> 00:28:16,796
And to show you how

703
00:28:16,796 --> 00:28:19,296
I'd like to invite Kevin

704
00:28:20,206 --> 00:28:20,546
Kevin [applause]?

705
00:28:22,226 --> 00:28:22,986
&gt;&gt; Thanks Justin.

706
00:28:24,776 --> 00:28:28,186
Hi. I'm Kevin Hiscott, and

707
00:28:28,186 --> 00:28:30,546
We are going to look at

708
00:28:30,936 --> 00:28:33,926
that presents terms and

709
00:28:34,866 --> 00:28:37,096
TextView is a subclass

710
00:28:37,096 --> 00:28:41,226
So we can take a look at how to

711
00:28:44,206 --> 00:28:45,666
Let's head over to

712
00:28:45,666 --> 00:28:46,936
and see what I have

713
00:28:47,136 --> 00:28:50,676
I have a text view with very

714
00:28:50,676 --> 00:28:51,396
pasted into it.

715
00:28:52,656 --> 00:28:55,746
And if we go into our

716
00:28:55,746 --> 00:28:57,646
that looks like in

717
00:28:57,646 --> 00:29:00,646
When I present my

718
00:28:57,646 --> 00:29:00,646
When I present my

719
00:29:00,756 --> 00:29:02,396
we can see along the bottom edge

720
00:29:02,506 --> 00:29:03,936
that the text is

721
00:29:04,336 --> 00:29:06,246
And if I try swiping

722
00:29:06,556 --> 00:29:07,846
the text does not scroll.

723
00:29:08,466 --> 00:29:09,946
Well let's go improve that.

724
00:29:11,506 --> 00:29:13,376
Let's head over to

725
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:14,566
And in viewDidLoad we are going

726
00:29:14,566 --> 00:29:17,486
to grab the outlet I have

727
00:29:17,486 --> 00:29:19,896
I have called it

728
00:29:20,896 --> 00:29:23,166
And on messageTextView

729
00:29:23,166 --> 00:29:24,576
there is a panGestureRecognizer.

730
00:29:24,576 --> 00:29:26,816
And we are going to change

731
00:29:26,816 --> 00:29:28,556
to include the indirect

732
00:29:29,276 --> 00:29:31,696
As Justin mentioned, those

733
00:29:31,696 --> 00:29:32,516
by the Siri remote.

734
00:29:33,836 --> 00:29:37,256
The second thing we are going to

735
00:29:37,586 --> 00:29:40,976
This will allow the text view to

736
00:29:41,076 --> 00:29:42,066
and receive these events.

737
00:29:42,486 --> 00:29:44,006
Let's build and run

738
00:29:52,306 --> 00:29:53,896
Now when I present

739
00:29:53,966 --> 00:29:57,806
I am actually able to directly

740
00:29:57,806 --> 00:29:58,956
and down with the Siri remote.

741
00:29:59,456 --> 00:30:01,006
Great direct manipulation.

742
00:29:59,456 --> 00:30:01,006
Great direct manipulation.

743
00:30:01,996 --> 00:30:03,356
The other thing any good terms

744
00:30:03,356 --> 00:30:06,416
and conditions ViewController

745
00:30:06,416 --> 00:30:09,386
to either accept or

746
00:30:10,126 --> 00:30:13,846
So to do that, let's head

747
00:30:13,846 --> 00:30:14,776
in a couple of buttons.

748
00:30:14,776 --> 00:30:21,806
I am going to label one Disagree

749
00:30:23,696 --> 00:30:25,926
Let's build and run

750
00:30:25,926 --> 00:30:30,216
What I hope to happen is for

751
00:30:30,216 --> 00:30:32,746
with horizontal swipes,

752
00:30:32,746 --> 00:30:34,106
to still scroll the text view.

753
00:30:34,986 --> 00:30:37,806
However, when I present my

754
00:30:37,806 --> 00:30:42,026
that vertical swipes does

755
00:30:42,026 --> 00:30:44,346
if I swipe too far down,

756
00:30:44,346 --> 00:30:47,236
down into the buttons, and I

757
00:30:47,306 --> 00:30:49,326
until focus moves back

758
00:30:50,156 --> 00:30:52,606
This isn't exactly the

759
00:30:52,606 --> 00:30:55,496
Let's head back to

760
00:30:55,496 --> 00:30:57,846
And we are going to

761
00:30:58,276 --> 00:31:00,686
We don't actually

762
00:30:58,276 --> 00:31:00,686
We don't actually

763
00:31:00,686 --> 00:31:02,686
to be a focusable

764
00:31:03,476 --> 00:31:05,066
Instead, I am going to

765
00:31:05,226 --> 00:31:08,226
We are going to grab

766
00:31:08,226 --> 00:31:12,176
and actually add it to our

767
00:31:12,626 --> 00:31:15,746
This will allow the message

768
00:31:15,746 --> 00:31:17,246
without being focusable itself.

769
00:31:18,426 --> 00:31:19,976
Let's build and run

770
00:31:26,056 --> 00:31:27,536
Now when I present

771
00:31:28,736 --> 00:31:31,116
we can see that the

772
00:31:31,116 --> 00:31:31,996
becomes focused.

773
00:31:32,216 --> 00:31:34,826
And that's because the text

774
00:31:34,916 --> 00:31:38,306
I can swipe the Siri remote

775
00:31:38,306 --> 00:31:41,616
But any time I can swipe up

776
00:31:42,266 --> 00:31:44,076
Great this is looking

777
00:31:44,076 --> 00:31:46,366
The last thing we

778
00:31:46,366 --> 00:31:49,926
on tvOS are directional

779
00:31:49,926 --> 00:31:52,426
by other input methods

780
00:31:52,596 --> 00:31:54,516
keyboards, or IR remotes.

781
00:31:54,516 --> 00:31:57,726
And we make this really

782
00:31:58,036 --> 00:32:00,526
Let's head back to my view

783
00:31:58,036 --> 00:32:00,526
Let's head back to my view

784
00:32:00,526 --> 00:32:02,616
to grab the

785
00:32:02,616 --> 00:32:05,336
Recognizer from our

786
00:32:05,826 --> 00:32:08,086
This will allow scrolling

787
00:32:08,086 --> 00:32:10,556
with those press types generated

788
00:32:11,656 --> 00:32:14,126
The last thing we are

789
00:32:14,126 --> 00:32:17,136
that GestureRecognizer onto our

790
00:32:17,176 --> 00:32:21,766
Let's build and run and see

791
00:32:25,656 --> 00:32:27,416
Now when I present my

792
00:32:27,806 --> 00:32:30,616
I can both swipe left

793
00:32:30,776 --> 00:32:34,216
but I can also tap left

794
00:32:34,566 --> 00:32:36,706
with the directional press

795
00:32:36,706 --> 00:32:39,196
on the Siri remote and

796
00:32:39,296 --> 00:32:43,716
I can swipe up and down to

797
00:32:43,716 --> 00:32:46,636
but I can also tap up and

798
00:32:47,336 --> 00:32:49,756
Great! This is a

799
00:32:49,756 --> 00:32:51,716
and conditions ViewController

800
00:32:52,456 --> 00:32:53,576
Thanks so much for your time.

801
00:32:53,576 --> 00:32:55,196
And I can't wait to

802
00:32:55,196 --> 00:32:56,426
and conditions in your apps.

803
00:32:56,816 --> 00:32:57,556
Back to Justin [applause].

804
00:33:00,046 --> 00:33:00,426
&gt;&gt; All right, let's move

805
00:33:00,426 --> 00:33:02,356
on to our final topic,

806
00:33:03,146 --> 00:33:05,736
So we have this great

807
00:33:05,846 --> 00:33:08,786
And there is a lot of features

808
00:33:08,786 --> 00:33:10,196
if you are using

809
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:11,996
I want to go through just

810
00:33:12,586 --> 00:33:14,086
One of them is dictation.

811
00:33:14,306 --> 00:33:16,756
So the user can just

812
00:33:16,756 --> 00:33:18,096
and their words will

813
00:33:19,306 --> 00:33:20,676
We also support Bluetooth

814
00:33:20,676 --> 00:33:21,826
So if you pair it with

815
00:33:21,826 --> 00:33:22,676
and you just type

816
00:33:23,316 --> 00:33:25,606
We have the new Apple

817
00:33:25,606 --> 00:33:27,896
so that users can pair

818
00:33:27,896 --> 00:33:29,616
and they can type right

819
00:33:29,746 --> 00:33:30,956
to send text to the TV.

820
00:33:31,416 --> 00:33:32,616
There is also a lot

821
00:33:32,616 --> 00:33:35,196
of localization details the

822
00:33:35,196 --> 00:33:35,626
of for you.

823
00:33:36,576 --> 00:33:38,926
And it also automatically

824
00:33:38,926 --> 00:33:40,406
on the input device

825
00:33:40,976 --> 00:33:42,316
So there is the linear layout

826
00:33:42,316 --> 00:33:43,626
that you are probably

827
00:33:43,626 --> 00:33:45,376
but there is also a grid

828
00:33:45,376 --> 00:33:47,346
if there is no Siri

829
00:33:47,346 --> 00:33:50,186
These are a lot of great

830
00:33:50,186 --> 00:33:51,246
in the system keyboard.

831
00:33:51,246 --> 00:33:53,116
And if you are not using

832
00:33:53,116 --> 00:33:55,666
then users won't be able to take

833
00:33:56,156 --> 00:33:59,196
So we discourage you from trying

834
00:33:59,196 --> 00:34:00,506
Really stick to the

835
00:33:59,196 --> 00:34:00,506
Really stick to the

836
00:34:00,506 --> 00:34:02,456
so that users can enjoy

837
00:34:02,456 --> 00:34:03,836
that are only available

838
00:34:04,216 --> 00:34:07,036
Now there are some ways that

839
00:34:07,036 --> 00:34:07,776
system keyboard.

840
00:34:08,246 --> 00:34:10,126
And one way that you can

841
00:34:10,126 --> 00:34:11,585
of your own views

842
00:34:11,585 --> 00:34:12,795
that will appear

843
00:34:12,795 --> 00:34:15,686
And you can use some API

844
00:34:15,686 --> 00:34:17,136
that you might recognize

845
00:34:17,136 --> 00:34:19,056
There is the inputAccessoryView

846
00:34:19,056 --> 00:34:20,906
and the inputAccessory

847
00:34:20,906 --> 00:34:23,326
And if you assign to these

848
00:34:23,326 --> 00:34:24,996
that you are wanting

849
00:34:25,326 --> 00:34:27,396
then when the keyboard

850
00:34:27,396 --> 00:34:29,246
of your own views right

851
00:34:29,246 --> 00:34:31,226
And I'll show you a screenshot

852
00:34:32,456 --> 00:34:34,076
And finally, I want to

853
00:34:34,076 --> 00:34:37,016
in behavior that's happened

854
00:34:37,456 --> 00:34:40,376
UITextField has this property

855
00:34:40,376 --> 00:34:42,346
and you can set to

856
00:34:42,606 --> 00:34:45,616
And on tvOS 9, if you

857
00:34:45,906 --> 00:34:47,966
then not only would the

858
00:34:47,966 --> 00:34:50,646
when it presents itself, but the

859
00:34:50,646 --> 00:34:51,815
as it's sitting there

860
00:34:52,545 --> 00:34:54,896
Well now in tvOS 10 we have

861
00:34:54,896 --> 00:34:57,596
And so the entire system can

862
00:34:57,876 --> 00:35:00,226
And so now what we

863
00:34:57,876 --> 00:35:00,226
And so now what we

864
00:35:00,226 --> 00:35:02,466
that this keyboard appearance

865
00:35:02,466 --> 00:35:04,246
keyboard, and the appearance

866
00:35:04,246 --> 00:35:05,846
of the text field

867
00:35:05,846 --> 00:35:08,476
by the larger tray

868
00:35:09,306 --> 00:35:10,986
Okay, so here's the

869
00:35:10,986 --> 00:35:14,036
So in this case I have created

870
00:35:14,036 --> 00:35:15,536
and I gave it an

871
00:35:15,536 --> 00:35:17,556
And I put a red border on it

872
00:35:17,896 --> 00:35:20,366
And those UI labels in there

873
00:35:20,366 --> 00:35:22,476
And I just put them in there

874
00:35:22,476 --> 00:35:23,586
of accessory views that you'd

875
00:35:23,586 --> 00:35:24,996
like that could appear

876
00:35:26,776 --> 00:35:29,246
Now another great way that

877
00:35:29,246 --> 00:35:31,236
at the same time as the keyboard

878
00:35:31,496 --> 00:35:33,996
And you use some APIs you

879
00:35:33,996 --> 00:35:35,246
and that's UISearchController.

880
00:35:35,676 --> 00:35:40,406
So we have the keyboard, and the

881
00:35:40,726 --> 00:35:42,876
And this also automatically

882
00:35:42,876 --> 00:35:45,116
There is a grid-based layout and

883
00:35:45,116 --> 00:35:46,556
on the input device

884
00:35:46,896 --> 00:35:48,606
And you can even

885
00:35:48,606 --> 00:35:49,456
of other view controllers.

886
00:35:49,456 --> 00:35:51,776
SearchController usually wants

887
00:35:51,776 --> 00:35:52,566
over the whole screen.

888
00:35:52,876 --> 00:35:54,726
But you can embed it

889
00:35:54,726 --> 00:35:57,496
another view controller

890
00:35:57,496 --> 00:35:58,006
ViewController.

891
00:35:58,006 --> 00:35:59,926
And I'll show you a code sample

892
00:36:00,176 --> 00:36:04,206
You provide your own custom view

893
00:36:04,236 --> 00:36:06,576
So the visual appearance

894
00:36:06,576 --> 00:36:08,146
and the interaction of them

895
00:36:08,146 --> 00:36:09,196
You can do whatever you want.

896
00:36:09,196 --> 00:36:11,516
You might use a collection view,

897
00:36:11,516 --> 00:36:13,066
that has a table view and a

898
00:36:13,266 --> 00:36:14,146
Any other things you'd like --

899
00:36:14,146 --> 00:36:15,646
it's totally up to you

900
00:36:17,696 --> 00:36:18,786
So here's a quick sample

901
00:36:18,786 --> 00:36:21,386
of how you might embed a

902
00:36:21,386 --> 00:36:23,006
of something else like,

903
00:36:23,006 --> 00:36:25,166
So I have got my custom

904
00:36:26,046 --> 00:36:29,126
And in viewDidAppear I am going

905
00:36:29,126 --> 00:36:30,766
I want to make sure I don't do

906
00:36:30,766 --> 00:36:32,016
to make sure I haven't

907
00:36:32,516 --> 00:36:35,316
Then I am creating

908
00:36:35,316 --> 00:36:38,066
and telling it view controller

909
00:36:38,066 --> 00:36:39,816
to contact as the

910
00:36:40,486 --> 00:36:42,216
Then I am going to

911
00:36:42,216 --> 00:36:44,246
of this UISearchContainer

912
00:36:44,246 --> 00:36:46,126
And this allows me now

913
00:36:46,286 --> 00:36:48,436
and I can do regular

914
00:36:48,436 --> 00:36:48,686
on it.

915
00:36:48,726 --> 00:36:50,946
And then I am going to add

916
00:36:50,946 --> 00:36:53,116
And if you do something like

917
00:36:53,116 --> 00:36:55,626
to easily use a search

918
00:36:55,786 --> 00:36:59,276
much like some of the

919
00:36:59,666 --> 00:37:01,176
And that is text input.

920
00:36:59,666 --> 00:37:01,176
And that is text input.

921
00:37:01,556 --> 00:37:03,586
So in summary, one of the

922
00:37:03,586 --> 00:37:04,466
to take away from this talk.

923
00:37:04,856 --> 00:37:07,706
First one is, when you are

924
00:37:07,806 --> 00:37:08,256
be careful.

925
00:37:08,256 --> 00:37:09,766
Keep in mind that you

926
00:37:09,766 --> 00:37:11,406
with the system gestures.

927
00:37:11,776 --> 00:37:14,936
When you are working with

928
00:37:14,936 --> 00:37:16,626
of the layout guides

929
00:37:16,626 --> 00:37:18,816
and the coordinated

930
00:37:18,816 --> 00:37:21,046
that your views can

931
00:37:21,096 --> 00:37:22,146
with the system animations.

932
00:37:23,656 --> 00:37:25,096
If you want to do

933
00:37:25,096 --> 00:37:26,606
on ScrollViews you

934
00:37:26,606 --> 00:37:27,696
of that handling code yourself.

935
00:37:27,696 --> 00:37:30,136
Just reuse the pan gestures

936
00:37:30,616 --> 00:37:33,836
And finally, take advantage of

937
00:37:33,836 --> 00:37:35,766
that your users are getting

938
00:37:35,766 --> 00:37:36,806
when it comes to text input.

939
00:37:37,526 --> 00:37:39,196
So for more information

940
00:37:39,196 --> 00:37:40,126
you can visit this URL,

941
00:37:40,126 --> 00:37:41,506
where you'll find

942
00:37:41,506 --> 00:37:43,576
We have got a bunch

943
00:37:43,576 --> 00:37:44,826
that are coming up this week.

944
00:37:44,826 --> 00:37:46,176
