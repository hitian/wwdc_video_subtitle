00:00:21,046 --> 00:00:22,516
&gt;&gt; Hello, and welcome

3
00:00:22,516 --> 00:00:24,096
on developing CarPlay Systems.

4
00:00:24,536 --> 00:00:26,296
My name is Emily,

5
00:00:26,296 --> 00:00:28,186
for Car Experience

6
00:00:29,906 --> 00:00:32,526
CarPlay was designed from

7
00:00:32,676 --> 00:00:34,766
safer way to use your

8
00:00:35,416 --> 00:00:37,176
CarPlay takes the

9
00:00:37,176 --> 00:00:39,636
with your iPhone while

10
00:00:39,636 --> 00:00:41,016
on your car's built-in display.

11
00:00:42,616 --> 00:00:44,436
CarPlay brings the

12
00:00:44,436 --> 00:00:47,376
and interaction patterns

13
00:00:47,836 --> 00:00:50,366
Users already know how

14
00:00:50,366 --> 00:00:52,006
because they know how

15
00:00:54,126 --> 00:00:56,606
CarPlay is about more

16
00:00:56,806 --> 00:00:57,936
on the car's display.

17
00:00:58,526 --> 00:01:00,126
CarPlay is thoughtfully

18
00:00:58,526 --> 00:01:00,126
CarPlay is thoughtfully

19
00:01:00,126 --> 00:01:01,836
with your car's built-in system

20
00:01:02,116 --> 00:01:04,786
to deliver the best

21
00:01:06,936 --> 00:01:09,116
CarPlay allows you to

22
00:01:09,696 --> 00:01:11,426
With CarPlay, you can

23
00:01:11,596 --> 00:01:14,306
and when Apple introduces

24
00:01:14,946 --> 00:01:17,486
users will immediately

25
00:01:18,206 --> 00:01:21,086
Your car will remain fresh

26
00:01:21,986 --> 00:01:25,806
Today we'll give you an overview

27
00:01:25,806 --> 00:01:27,536
of how the CarPlay

28
00:01:27,936 --> 00:01:30,036
and discuss the most

29
00:01:30,036 --> 00:01:30,906
for you to consider.

30
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:34,106
We'll explain the user

31
00:01:34,106 --> 00:01:36,886
to enable with CarPlay

32
00:01:36,886 --> 00:01:37,616
that we've provided.

33
00:01:37,616 --> 00:01:44,146
At the end, we'll talk about

34
00:01:44,146 --> 00:01:46,636
IPhone user interface is

35
00:01:46,636 --> 00:01:49,066
when held in the hand, when

36
00:01:50,886 --> 00:01:53,776
CarPlay translates that

37
00:01:54,186 --> 00:01:57,286
making it appropriate in that

38
00:01:59,196 --> 00:02:01,526
It works with what you

39
00:01:59,196 --> 00:02:01,526
It works with what you

40
00:02:01,916 --> 00:02:03,936
It's comfortable to use

41
00:02:06,766 --> 00:02:09,645
Now let's talk about how

42
00:02:11,656 --> 00:02:14,546
Let's start with the native

43
00:02:17,206 --> 00:02:21,976
When an iPhone is plugged in,

44
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,956
When a CarPlay session

45
00:02:25,326 --> 00:02:27,376
information is sent

46
00:02:27,376 --> 00:02:29,116
communication protocols.

47
00:02:30,956 --> 00:02:32,846
Video can be sent

48
00:02:32,846 --> 00:02:35,786
to the car as well as audio.

49
00:02:37,736 --> 00:02:41,266
Audio can also be sent from the

50
00:02:43,386 --> 00:02:45,436
Once a CarPlay session

51
00:02:45,716 --> 00:02:48,386
different combinations of

52
00:02:50,946 --> 00:02:53,006
When a CarPlay Home

53
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:56,196
and no audio is playing, the

54
00:02:56,196 --> 00:02:58,166
for setup and location

55
00:02:58,596 --> 00:03:02,246
An H264 video stream showing

56
00:02:58,596 --> 00:03:02,246
An H264 video stream showing

57
00:03:02,246 --> 00:03:03,636
from the iPhone to the car.

58
00:03:06,036 --> 00:03:08,166
If we then play audio

59
00:03:08,406 --> 00:03:10,986
the communication protocols

60
00:03:10,986 --> 00:03:12,776
to send information

61
00:03:12,946 --> 00:03:17,126
The video stream here is

62
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:19,846
and audio for the song

63
00:03:22,196 --> 00:03:26,086
If the CarPlay UI is exited,

64
00:03:26,446 --> 00:03:28,756
the CarPlay session

65
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:32,366
The communication protocols

66
00:03:32,366 --> 00:03:34,646
for now playing and

67
00:03:35,186 --> 00:03:37,316
The video stream is

68
00:03:37,686 --> 00:03:39,516
but CarPlay audio still plays,

69
00:03:40,056 --> 00:03:42,506
even though CarPlay

70
00:03:43,446 --> 00:03:46,076
The screen and audio are

71
00:03:46,836 --> 00:03:50,606
Video from the native system

72
00:03:50,606 --> 00:03:51,216
is playing.

73
00:03:51,986 --> 00:03:53,926
If the CarPlay interface

74
00:03:54,376 --> 00:04:00,186
audio from the native system,

75
00:03:54,376 --> 00:04:00,186
audio from the native system,

76
00:04:00,546 --> 00:04:04,156
Let's see what happens if Siri

77
00:04:04,156 --> 00:04:05,846
push-to-talk steering

78
00:04:06,786 --> 00:04:09,956
The communication protocols will

79
00:04:10,176 --> 00:04:12,416
that iOS voice recognition

80
00:04:13,426 --> 00:04:15,596
The CarPlay UI is

81
00:04:15,676 --> 00:04:18,696
and the Siri audio chime plays

82
00:04:19,396 --> 00:04:21,826
In this case, audio is also sent

83
00:04:21,826 --> 00:04:24,836
from the car's microphones

84
00:04:27,506 --> 00:04:29,996
These examples gave you

85
00:04:29,996 --> 00:04:31,416
of how CarPlay works.

86
00:04:33,786 --> 00:04:35,286
Now let's look in more detail

87
00:04:35,286 --> 00:04:37,666
at what's happening

88
00:04:39,626 --> 00:04:42,566
For wired CarPlay,

89
00:04:44,446 --> 00:04:46,776
All data is wrapped in IP.

90
00:04:47,776 --> 00:04:50,456
Except for the iAP2

91
00:04:52,456 --> 00:04:57,696
Information from vehicle sensors

92
00:04:57,876 --> 00:05:00,076
telephony, and turn-by-turn

93
00:04:57,876 --> 00:05:00,076
telephony, and turn-by-turn

94
00:05:01,876 --> 00:05:05,036
The communication plug-in is

95
00:05:05,076 --> 00:05:08,986
and that receives the incoming

96
00:05:09,036 --> 00:05:11,056
as an additional

97
00:05:13,066 --> 00:05:16,086
The audio and video is sent to

98
00:05:16,546 --> 00:05:19,456
connected to the speakers,

99
00:05:21,526 --> 00:05:25,166
Control events from the

100
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:26,846
or touchpad are sent

101
00:05:26,846 --> 00:05:32,396
Now in the case of

102
00:05:32,686 --> 00:05:34,306
much of the system

103
00:05:35,986 --> 00:05:37,966
Both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth

104
00:05:39,406 --> 00:05:41,956
For wireless, all

105
00:05:43,436 --> 00:05:46,276
Connections to the vehicle's

106
00:05:48,616 --> 00:05:50,976
Now that you have a

107
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:52,426
of how CarPlay works, we'll go

108
00:05:52,426 --> 00:05:54,666
over the most important

109
00:05:56,076 --> 00:05:58,266
We will talk through

110
00:05:58,606 --> 00:06:01,326
We want to make sure you

111
00:05:58,606 --> 00:06:01,326
We want to make sure you

112
00:06:01,326 --> 00:06:04,576
before you begin to design a

113
00:06:04,576 --> 00:06:06,876
that it's capable of

114
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:11,776
First, the vehicle

115
00:06:11,776 --> 00:06:14,446
A high-quality display

116
00:06:14,446 --> 00:06:15,816
to the CarPlay experience.

117
00:06:17,926 --> 00:06:20,606
Several standard display

118
00:06:20,606 --> 00:06:25,476
and those resolutions

119
00:06:25,806 --> 00:06:28,166
Most are approximately 16 by 9.

120
00:06:29,256 --> 00:06:31,426
Extra-wide screens

121
00:06:32,156 --> 00:06:35,916
Today, all supported resolutions

122
00:06:37,846 --> 00:06:40,926
We have support for screens

123
00:06:42,856 --> 00:06:46,146
Asset sizes in CarPlay have

124
00:06:46,146 --> 00:06:48,006
on the resolution of the screen.

125
00:06:48,906 --> 00:06:51,706
So that assets will

126
00:06:51,706 --> 00:06:53,236
and high resolution screens.

127
00:06:54,096 --> 00:06:58,196
Without this, icons on the 720

128
00:07:00,976 --> 00:07:03,986
If you do have a display with

129
00:07:03,986 --> 00:07:07,006
than what was listed here,

130
00:07:07,006 --> 00:07:08,106
if it can be supported.

131
00:07:09,026 --> 00:07:12,126
We require that aftermarket

132
00:07:12,126 --> 00:07:13,086
than six inches

133
00:07:13,376 --> 00:07:15,736
since aftermarket

134
00:07:15,846 --> 00:07:17,846
into a wide variety of vehicles.

135
00:07:18,756 --> 00:07:21,626
There is no minimum for

136
00:07:22,126 --> 00:07:24,526
The automaker has the

137
00:07:24,526 --> 00:07:27,506
that CarPlay is appropriate on

138
00:07:29,806 --> 00:07:32,986
I should mention several

139
00:07:33,376 --> 00:07:35,496
Twenty-four bit color

140
00:07:35,856 --> 00:07:39,426
and a 60 hertz refresh rate

141
00:07:39,596 --> 00:07:41,696
for a responsive user interface.

142
00:07:42,276 --> 00:07:45,816
Make sure that your H264 decoder

143
00:07:46,246 --> 00:07:47,886
This is a hard requirement.

144
00:07:47,886 --> 00:07:53,466
A high-quality display in

145
00:07:53,466 --> 00:07:55,036
to the CarPlay experience.

146
00:07:55,966 --> 00:07:58,906
Let's talk about the car's

147
00:08:00,576 --> 00:08:02,156
CarPlay audio is separated

148
00:08:02,156 --> 00:08:05,846
into two streams main

149
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:09,926
Main audio is bi-directional,

150
00:08:09,926 --> 00:08:12,416
and other media plus

151
00:08:13,866 --> 00:08:16,016
Alternate audio is

152
00:08:16,456 --> 00:08:20,686
and it must always be mixed by

153
00:08:21,146 --> 00:08:24,676
If the head unit is playing

154
00:08:24,876 --> 00:08:27,046
the head unit must

155
00:08:27,046 --> 00:08:29,036
from iPhone with that audio.

156
00:08:31,336 --> 00:08:33,916
LPCM is used for wired CarPlay.

157
00:08:34,576 --> 00:08:37,326
Wireless CarPlay

158
00:08:37,986 --> 00:08:42,246
AAC-LC is used for media, and

159
00:08:42,576 --> 00:08:45,636
and AAC-ELD for other audio.

160
00:08:49,456 --> 00:08:52,886
CarPlay supports the

161
00:08:52,886 --> 00:08:53,786
in your vehicles.

162
00:08:55,496 --> 00:08:58,126
The CarPlay UI can be

163
00:08:58,126 --> 00:09:02,106
on the head unit, by knobs

164
00:08:58,126 --> 00:09:02,106
on the head unit, by knobs

165
00:09:02,696 --> 00:09:06,196
The Siri button on the steering

166
00:09:06,476 --> 00:09:07,336
input device.

167
00:09:09,766 --> 00:09:11,456
Many vehicles have touchscreens,

168
00:09:11,456 --> 00:09:12,976
and let's talk about

169
00:09:13,306 --> 00:09:18,556
When the CarPlay UI is active,

170
00:09:18,866 --> 00:09:21,246
the head unit sends

171
00:09:21,246 --> 00:09:22,906
y coordinates of that touch.

172
00:09:23,536 --> 00:09:26,616
The head unit sends all

173
00:09:26,616 --> 00:09:28,526
when CarPlay is displayed

174
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:31,786
CarPlay is controlled

175
00:09:32,526 --> 00:09:34,736
We support two types

176
00:09:34,936 --> 00:09:37,806
what we call high-fidelity

177
00:09:37,986 --> 00:09:42,426
High-fidelity touch

178
00:09:42,816 --> 00:09:46,836
So swipe gestures that track

179
00:09:48,386 --> 00:09:51,516
A high-performance system

180
00:09:51,656 --> 00:09:55,846
one that has less than 140

181
00:09:57,856 --> 00:10:00,706
This is how list scrolling

182
00:09:57,856 --> 00:10:00,706
This is how list scrolling

183
00:10:00,706 --> 00:10:02,776
that tracks the touch

184
00:10:02,776 --> 00:10:04,586
with a high-fidelity

185
00:10:09,046 --> 00:10:12,156
Low-fidelity touchscreens

186
00:10:12,316 --> 00:10:14,076
and are often resistive screens.

187
00:10:14,836 --> 00:10:18,136
Taps control the UI, and

188
00:10:18,176 --> 00:10:19,206
user's finger.

189
00:10:21,576 --> 00:10:24,386
This is how list scrolling

190
00:10:24,386 --> 00:10:26,226
with a low-fidelity

191
00:10:33,046 --> 00:10:36,326
Some vehicles use knob,

192
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:39,086
Sometimes these are the

193
00:10:39,336 --> 00:10:41,756
and sometimes they are

194
00:10:42,316 --> 00:10:44,616
All combinations are

195
00:10:46,886 --> 00:10:50,406
Knobs are supported by the

196
00:10:53,716 --> 00:10:58,286
select, and back events.

197
00:10:58,426 --> 00:11:04,286
This is the minimum set

198
00:10:58,426 --> 00:11:04,286
This is the minimum set

199
00:11:04,286 --> 00:11:06,706
for a knob that's used

200
00:11:07,226 --> 00:11:09,106
Rotate, select, and back.

201
00:11:10,566 --> 00:11:13,646
Some knobs also support

202
00:11:18,366 --> 00:11:21,146
This capability is

203
00:11:25,506 --> 00:11:30,436
Vehicle touchpads report

204
00:11:30,436 --> 00:11:35,056
as select and a back button.

205
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:41,516
If a knob or touchpad

206
00:11:41,816 --> 00:11:43,706
back and select are required.

207
00:11:44,476 --> 00:11:48,036
Secondary touchpads can also

208
00:11:48,586 --> 00:11:52,146
Buttons for various functions

209
00:11:52,356 --> 00:11:54,256
and telephony functions

210
00:11:56,386 --> 00:11:58,726
The CarPlay UI will

211
00:11:58,726 --> 00:12:01,506
to match the user inputs

212
00:11:58,726 --> 00:12:01,506
to match the user inputs

213
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:03,816
All combinations are possible.

214
00:12:04,326 --> 00:12:06,856
If the main controller

215
00:12:07,066 --> 00:12:10,086
then combinations

216
00:12:10,086 --> 00:12:12,396
or knob plus touchpad

217
00:12:15,556 --> 00:12:17,826
A hard button for

218
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:22,216
Siri is really important

219
00:12:22,216 --> 00:12:25,596
The user needs a quick way

220
00:12:25,596 --> 00:12:27,736
if the CarPlay UI isn't showing.

221
00:12:28,286 --> 00:12:30,146
Usually this requirement

222
00:12:30,146 --> 00:12:32,416
with a push-to-talk button

223
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:34,906
For the Siri button, we require

224
00:12:34,906 --> 00:12:38,256
that the head unit send iPhone

225
00:12:38,256 --> 00:12:41,846
so that interaction during the

226
00:12:42,946 --> 00:12:46,166
This wraps up our

227
00:12:49,986 --> 00:12:52,396
Sensor information is

228
00:12:54,246 --> 00:12:57,456
CarPlay needs location

229
00:12:57,726 --> 00:12:59,676
so that the map's

230
00:13:00,276 --> 00:13:03,186
Speed and GNSS information

231
00:13:04,066 --> 00:13:05,956
Every vehicle needs

232
00:13:06,396 --> 00:13:09,256
Speed information is used

233
00:13:09,256 --> 00:13:13,056
and is critical if the

234
00:13:13,056 --> 00:13:14,226
or GLONASS receiver.

235
00:13:14,956 --> 00:13:18,086
GNSS information includes

236
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:20,196
if the vehicle has

237
00:13:22,866 --> 00:13:26,296
Satellite location information

238
00:13:26,296 --> 00:13:28,196
in addition to the

239
00:13:28,616 --> 00:13:30,446
to determine the

240
00:13:31,216 --> 00:13:33,296
This data from the

241
00:13:33,376 --> 00:13:36,056
since a larger antenna can

242
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:38,796
This is the recommended

243
00:13:38,796 --> 00:13:42,506
since it will result in the

244
00:13:43,116 --> 00:13:45,276
Sending satellite

245
00:13:45,276 --> 00:13:46,706
to iPhone is required

246
00:13:46,706 --> 00:13:49,206
if the vehicle has the

247
00:13:50,576 --> 00:13:52,836
GNSS information

248
00:13:52,836 --> 00:13:55,626
for any system supporting

249
00:13:56,046 --> 00:13:59,406
since it's more likely that the

250
00:13:59,406 --> 00:14:02,166
or somewhere where the phone

251
00:13:59,406 --> 00:14:02,166
or somewhere where the phone

252
00:14:05,576 --> 00:14:07,136
What are the requirements

253
00:14:07,136 --> 00:14:09,336
for connecting an

254
00:14:11,896 --> 00:14:15,486
Apple CarPlay supports both

255
00:14:15,986 --> 00:14:18,476
We're excited about the

256
00:14:18,556 --> 00:14:20,876
since it offers a very

257
00:14:20,876 --> 00:14:21,596
for customers.

258
00:14:22,286 --> 00:14:25,096
Users can leave their

259
00:14:25,426 --> 00:14:27,626
which is especially

260
00:14:29,636 --> 00:14:31,696
Let's first talk about

261
00:14:33,356 --> 00:14:36,836
USB is used here,

262
00:14:36,836 --> 00:14:38,706
and control information

263
00:14:38,706 --> 00:14:43,276
Your head unit will need

264
00:14:43,276 --> 00:14:47,016
The head unit will switch from

265
00:14:47,946 --> 00:14:50,046
High throughput is a

266
00:14:50,046 --> 00:14:53,106
to make sure your USB

267
00:14:53,106 --> 00:14:54,326
required data rates.

268
00:14:54,926 --> 00:14:57,276
If you have multiple USB

269
00:14:57,536 --> 00:14:59,496
and not all of them

270
00:14:59,846 --> 00:15:01,566
you'll need to properly

271
00:14:59,846 --> 00:15:01,566
you'll need to properly

272
00:15:05,116 --> 00:15:07,586
Wireless CarPlay is

273
00:15:09,316 --> 00:15:11,856
Both Bluetooth and

274
00:15:13,686 --> 00:15:17,196
Bluetooth is used for discovery

275
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,886
Once the Wi-Fi credentials

276
00:15:22,886 --> 00:15:26,356
over Bluetooth, Wi-Fi

277
00:15:27,566 --> 00:15:29,156
Bluetooth is disconnected,

278
00:15:29,636 --> 00:15:32,986
and all subsequent CarPlay

279
00:15:33,686 --> 00:15:36,186
During the CarPlay

280
00:15:36,466 --> 00:15:40,956
including phone call audio and

281
00:15:41,376 --> 00:15:42,876
as well as the control protocol.

282
00:15:46,026 --> 00:15:48,836
CarPlay requires a

283
00:15:48,836 --> 00:15:51,346
and 5 gigahertz is recommended.

284
00:15:51,876 --> 00:15:53,216
Note that high throughput,

285
00:15:53,376 --> 00:15:56,086
25 megabits per second,

286
00:15:56,896 --> 00:15:58,446
The Bluetooth subsystem needs

287
00:15:58,446 --> 00:16:00,566
to support the communication

288
00:15:58,446 --> 00:16:00,566
to support the communication

289
00:16:01,596 --> 00:16:05,106
Wireless CarPlay offers a

290
00:16:05,106 --> 00:16:06,686
experience, and we're excited

291
00:16:06,686 --> 00:16:08,546
to see your vehicles

292
00:16:10,016 --> 00:16:13,636
Now let's hear from Donald about

293
00:16:14,836 --> 00:16:16,976
&gt;&gt; Hi. My name is Donald, and

294
00:16:17,796 --> 00:16:19,586
Now that you've seen

295
00:16:20,236 --> 00:16:21,646
let's look at some

296
00:16:21,646 --> 00:16:23,616
that will help you provide

297
00:16:23,616 --> 00:16:24,276
in your cars.

298
00:16:29,046 --> 00:16:30,206
One of the most important

299
00:16:30,206 --> 00:16:32,716
that CarPlay is really designed

300
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:38,646
CarPlay is instantly

301
00:16:38,646 --> 00:16:39,896
and they feel comfortable

302
00:16:39,896 --> 00:16:42,396
because it's a consistent

303
00:16:43,016 --> 00:16:45,216
visual language, and system

304
00:16:46,786 --> 00:16:49,086
Every interaction with

305
00:16:49,086 --> 00:16:50,456
when users can trust

306
00:16:50,456 --> 00:16:51,876
on the screen is

307
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:58,856
If a user has to discern which

308
00:16:59,826 --> 00:17:02,116
and which elements are part

309
00:16:59,826 --> 00:17:02,116
and which elements are part

310
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:05,486
then every interaction

311
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:10,715
Also, your car's native user

312
00:17:10,715 --> 00:17:12,356
that resemble or have

313
00:17:12,356 --> 00:17:13,546
to icons within CarPlay.

314
00:17:14,106 --> 00:17:16,726
And it can be confusing

315
00:17:16,726 --> 00:17:17,976
on the display at the same time.

316
00:17:23,046 --> 00:17:25,116
Instead, use the entire

317
00:17:30,506 --> 00:17:32,546
Let's take a look at what should

318
00:17:35,366 --> 00:17:37,956
CarPlay always starts the moment

319
00:17:38,506 --> 00:17:40,346
Users should never have to

320
00:17:44,806 --> 00:17:46,486
When the user connects

321
00:17:46,486 --> 00:17:48,636
for the first time, the

322
00:17:48,636 --> 00:17:49,756
to show CarPlay right away.

323
00:17:53,556 --> 00:17:55,656
This provides feedback

324
00:17:55,656 --> 00:17:58,246
and creates a strong association

325
00:17:58,976 --> 00:18:00,666
and the familiar

326
00:17:58,976 --> 00:18:00,666
and the familiar

327
00:18:04,536 --> 00:18:05,586
Don't show notifications

328
00:18:05,586 --> 00:18:07,466
to announce state changes

329
00:18:07,726 --> 00:18:09,046
The needed appearance of CarPlay

330
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:11,326
in the display is the most

331
00:18:15,506 --> 00:18:16,686
Now let's consider

332
00:18:16,686 --> 00:18:18,146
after the initial

333
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:21,476
When users connect their iPhone

334
00:18:21,476 --> 00:18:23,276
like a continuation of

335
00:18:27,076 --> 00:18:28,626
So if CarPlay was

336
00:18:28,626 --> 00:18:31,016
when the user left the car,

337
00:18:31,016 --> 00:18:32,046
when iPhone is connected.

338
00:18:33,196 --> 00:18:34,906
And if CarPlay media

339
00:18:34,906 --> 00:18:37,626
when the user left the car,

340
00:18:37,626 --> 00:18:39,826
when iPhone is reconnected

341
00:18:39,826 --> 00:18:42,826
as the user did not select

342
00:18:42,896 --> 00:18:44,166
between their CarPlay

343
00:18:46,496 --> 00:18:47,256
In other words, we want

344
00:18:47,256 --> 00:18:49,226
to always respect the last

345
00:18:49,226 --> 00:18:49,676
in the car.

346
00:18:54,186 --> 00:18:55,906
Let's see how last

347
00:18:56,616 --> 00:18:57,876
Notice that I'm using CarPlay,

348
00:18:57,996 --> 00:18:59,396
and it's showing on

349
00:19:00,766 --> 00:19:04,736
Now if I disconnect, CarPlay

350
00:19:04,736 --> 00:19:06,006
to its native user interface.

351
00:19:06,566 --> 00:19:10,376
If I plug in again, CarPlay

352
00:19:10,376 --> 00:19:12,216
because that was the last

353
00:19:16,606 --> 00:19:18,766
So if CarPlay was the

354
00:19:18,766 --> 00:19:21,436
when it was disconnected,

355
00:19:21,546 --> 00:19:23,696
CarPlay should be shown when

356
00:19:25,066 --> 00:19:27,706
If CarPlay media was playing,

357
00:19:32,496 --> 00:19:33,606
Let's see a different example.

358
00:19:33,996 --> 00:19:35,366
This time, CarPlay is active

359
00:19:35,526 --> 00:19:37,826
with the car's display showing

360
00:19:38,956 --> 00:19:42,076
Now if I disconnect

361
00:19:43,106 --> 00:19:44,806
CarPlay does not

362
00:19:45,556 --> 00:19:47,546
because the native user

363
00:19:47,546 --> 00:19:48,496
was using in the car.

364
00:19:52,466 --> 00:19:55,526
So if CarPlay was not the last

365
00:19:55,526 --> 00:19:56,816
in the car's user interface.

366
00:19:57,766 --> 00:20:00,166
But even if CarPlay was not

367
00:19:57,766 --> 00:20:00,166
But even if CarPlay was not

368
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,976
if CarPlay media was playing,

369
00:20:07,476 --> 00:20:09,946
CarPlay is available the moment

370
00:20:10,896 --> 00:20:12,856
but they can switch

371
00:20:12,856 --> 00:20:14,716
and the native user

372
00:20:15,546 --> 00:20:18,526
As we saw earlier,

373
00:20:18,526 --> 00:20:21,226
to the car's user interface

374
00:20:21,296 --> 00:20:22,266
in the CarPlay Home screen.

375
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:25,516
They can switch back to CarPlay

376
00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:26,996
by using the Apple

377
00:20:31,236 --> 00:20:33,466
The Apple CarPlay button is

378
00:20:33,466 --> 00:20:34,566
that CarPlay is available.

379
00:20:34,966 --> 00:20:36,276
As soon as CarPlay starts,

380
00:20:36,746 --> 00:20:38,576
the Apple CarPlay

381
00:20:38,576 --> 00:20:39,566
in your top level menu.

382
00:20:43,086 --> 00:20:45,966
And the Apple CarPlay must only

383
00:20:45,966 --> 00:20:47,036
and CarPlay is active.

384
00:20:51,046 --> 00:20:52,796
Be sure to hide the

385
00:20:52,796 --> 00:20:53,966
when iPhone is disconnected.

386
00:20:58,216 --> 00:21:00,686
And they also show the

387
00:20:58,216 --> 00:21:00,686
And they also show the

388
00:21:00,686 --> 00:21:02,716
in an enabled state

389
00:21:03,656 --> 00:21:06,486
and in a disabled state

390
00:21:10,696 --> 00:21:13,546
You can optionally replace an

391
00:21:13,546 --> 00:21:16,756
menu with the Apple CarPlay

392
00:21:20,866 --> 00:21:22,976
Just remember that the Apple

393
00:21:22,976 --> 00:21:25,366
on your car's Home screen

394
00:21:25,986 --> 00:21:27,166
When iPhone is disconnected,

395
00:21:27,356 --> 00:21:30,156
the Apple CarPlay button must

396
00:21:34,046 --> 00:21:35,496
Let's talk about the

397
00:21:35,496 --> 00:21:37,186
that should appear

398
00:21:37,836 --> 00:21:41,996
There are a variety of approved

399
00:21:42,086 --> 00:21:44,486
to use as buttons in your

400
00:21:45,136 --> 00:21:47,256
Choose the one that makes the

401
00:21:49,006 --> 00:21:54,106
There's a black logo and a

402
00:21:54,106 --> 00:21:55,616
and black variance

403
00:21:56,046 --> 00:21:59,566
And, finally, there's

404
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:08,346
Let's talk about how

405
00:22:08,346 --> 00:22:09,586
when iPhone is disconnected.

406
00:22:12,276 --> 00:22:13,646
Let's say that CarPlay

407
00:22:13,646 --> 00:22:15,836
and the user is listening

408
00:22:16,326 --> 00:22:20,856
When iPhone is disconnected,

409
00:22:20,856 --> 00:22:22,026
that they're about

410
00:22:22,996 --> 00:22:25,256
Your system should

411
00:22:25,256 --> 00:22:26,156
being disconnected.

412
00:22:29,226 --> 00:22:31,966
When iPhone is disconnected,

413
00:22:31,966 --> 00:22:34,606
and audio should not fall

414
00:22:36,156 --> 00:22:39,596
If the iPhone is disconnected

415
00:22:39,596 --> 00:22:41,906
on the car's display, you

416
00:22:41,906 --> 00:22:44,326
to the last screen displayed

417
00:22:45,226 --> 00:22:48,506
Don't show a CarPlay unavailable

418
00:22:51,246 --> 00:22:55,376
So, again, when CarPlay

419
00:22:55,376 --> 00:22:57,596
and the user disconnects iPhone,

420
00:23:02,336 --> 00:23:04,226
The hardware buttons in

421
00:23:04,226 --> 00:23:05,106
to support CarPlay.

422
00:23:08,676 --> 00:23:10,546
Siri is an integral

423
00:23:10,546 --> 00:23:12,486
and requires a dedicated

424
00:23:13,026 --> 00:23:14,766
Because it's so important,

425
00:23:14,766 --> 00:23:16,956
on the car steering wheel.

426
00:23:16,996 --> 00:23:19,426
Users expected Siri to

427
00:23:19,426 --> 00:23:21,906
or not CarPlay is currently

428
00:23:23,386 --> 00:23:24,976
They also expect the

429
00:23:24,976 --> 00:23:26,236
like the Home button on iPhone.

430
00:23:26,836 --> 00:23:29,656
Pressing and holding it for 600

431
00:23:29,656 --> 00:23:32,496
Siri, and the activation

432
00:23:32,496 --> 00:23:33,206
than one second.

433
00:23:34,406 --> 00:23:38,056
The media buttons in your

434
00:23:38,056 --> 00:23:40,636
to CarPlay media playback

435
00:23:40,816 --> 00:23:42,576
move to the next track

436
00:23:42,576 --> 00:23:43,876
and fast forward and rewind.

437
00:23:48,206 --> 00:23:50,516
Finally, if your car has

438
00:23:50,516 --> 00:23:53,066
media, or navigation,

439
00:23:53,066 --> 00:23:54,576
to the respective

440
00:23:59,256 --> 00:24:01,656
&gt;&gt; Now let's talk about

441
00:23:59,256 --> 00:24:01,656
&gt;&gt; Now let's talk about

442
00:24:04,546 --> 00:24:06,696
Apps supported by

443
00:24:06,696 --> 00:24:08,706
on the CarPlay Home

444
00:24:09,306 --> 00:24:11,416
Three categories of

445
00:24:12,056 --> 00:24:13,956
Audio, those specific

446
00:24:13,956 --> 00:24:17,766
to particular vehicles,

447
00:24:18,576 --> 00:24:22,216
If a user has an audio app

448
00:24:22,636 --> 00:24:23,756
that app will appear

449
00:24:23,756 --> 00:24:26,576
in any CarPlay car

450
00:24:26,576 --> 00:24:30,386
The user interface for

451
00:24:30,656 --> 00:24:32,256
with the structure

452
00:24:32,576 --> 00:24:35,206
and the content provided

453
00:24:36,026 --> 00:24:37,996
You'll notice that

454
00:24:37,996 --> 00:24:39,226
like the built-in music app.

455
00:24:40,136 --> 00:24:43,456
Users choose what to listen

456
00:24:43,706 --> 00:24:47,346
and the Now Playing screen

457
00:24:47,346 --> 00:24:48,126
and controls.

458
00:24:48,986 --> 00:24:51,496
The app needs to have a

459
00:24:51,496 --> 00:24:53,036
to be compatible with CarPlay.

460
00:24:54,236 --> 00:24:56,286
We've made some improvements

461
00:24:56,286 --> 00:25:00,746
to make the audio apps

462
00:24:56,286 --> 00:25:00,746
to make the audio apps

463
00:25:00,846 --> 00:25:04,336
New in iOS 10 is support for

464
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:06,116
to navigate list hierarchies.

465
00:25:06,896 --> 00:25:10,256
In the Now Playing screen,

466
00:25:10,256 --> 00:25:12,226
and additional playback

467
00:25:12,986 --> 00:25:15,616
In the list views, you can

468
00:25:16,296 --> 00:25:18,326
which are available

469
00:25:18,796 --> 00:25:20,586
explicit or live stream.

470
00:25:21,356 --> 00:25:23,586
Some apps are designed

471
00:25:23,586 --> 00:25:25,606
as they're launched,

472
00:25:25,606 --> 00:25:27,246
for these apps in iOS 10.

473
00:25:28,096 --> 00:25:31,376
All of these combined make for

474
00:25:34,916 --> 00:25:41,406
Check out the new tabs, the

475
00:25:43,066 --> 00:25:45,726
and the way tend to note

476
00:25:48,226 --> 00:25:51,596
In the now playing

477
00:25:51,596 --> 00:25:55,076
and the additional

478
00:25:56,886 --> 00:25:59,676
Now let's talk about that

479
00:25:59,676 --> 00:26:01,236
to work in specific vehicles.

480
00:25:59,676 --> 00:26:01,236
to work in specific vehicles.

481
00:26:03,296 --> 00:26:05,406
Apps published by

482
00:26:05,406 --> 00:26:07,006
to control vehicle functions

483
00:26:07,396 --> 00:26:09,476
or give information

484
00:26:10,086 --> 00:26:14,146
They only appear in vehicles

485
00:26:14,596 --> 00:26:18,526
A CarPlay entitlement is

486
00:26:19,036 --> 00:26:24,086
New in iOS 10 is Siri

487
00:26:24,156 --> 00:26:25,756
that control vehicle functions.

488
00:26:26,586 --> 00:26:30,106
Siri now has built-in support

489
00:26:30,546 --> 00:26:32,896
changing climate

490
00:26:33,756 --> 00:26:36,346
The automaker app

491
00:26:36,626 --> 00:26:38,126
to perform these functions

492
00:26:38,126 --> 00:26:43,376
after Siri tells the app what

493
00:26:43,746 --> 00:26:46,246
Let me explain how

494
00:26:46,246 --> 00:26:47,576
in the cars that support them.

495
00:26:48,226 --> 00:26:51,956
An app icon is enabled in

496
00:26:52,126 --> 00:26:54,266
if the iPhone is

497
00:26:54,576 --> 00:26:56,696
that supports the same

498
00:26:57,966 --> 00:26:59,836
A protocol name supported

499
00:26:59,836 --> 00:27:02,086
and the app need to match.

500
00:26:59,836 --> 00:27:02,086
and the app need to match.

501
00:27:02,976 --> 00:27:06,416
iAP external accessory

502
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:08,226
to head unit communication.

503
00:27:10,026 --> 00:27:12,976
Head units can declare

504
00:27:12,976 --> 00:27:15,056
to support current

505
00:27:15,406 --> 00:27:17,346
with different groups

506
00:27:18,246 --> 00:27:20,506
Head units should

507
00:27:20,796 --> 00:27:22,916
to match all cars

508
00:27:23,316 --> 00:27:25,416
For example, com.brand.

509
00:27:26,796 --> 00:27:29,726
They should also use

510
00:27:29,726 --> 00:27:31,696
with specific features,

511
00:27:31,696 --> 00:27:33,636
electric vehicles

512
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:39,306
A protocol name for the specific

513
00:27:39,556 --> 00:27:41,226
so that apps that target just

514
00:27:41,226 --> 00:27:43,676
that model can be

515
00:27:46,226 --> 00:27:49,236
The head unit needs

516
00:27:49,236 --> 00:27:52,896
at least one supported

517
00:27:53,416 --> 00:27:54,656
Likely more than one.

518
00:27:55,546 --> 00:27:59,406
Start and stop external protocol

519
00:27:59,966 --> 00:28:04,246
and external accessory protocol

520
00:27:59,966 --> 00:28:04,246
and external accessory protocol

521
00:28:05,296 --> 00:28:08,136
If the car supports

522
00:28:08,416 --> 00:28:11,666
these iAP2 messages

523
00:28:11,666 --> 00:28:13,696
on all supported transports.

524
00:28:15,296 --> 00:28:17,946
Most automaker apps will

525
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:21,336
to perform tasks such as

526
00:28:21,906 --> 00:28:23,446
These apps need to design

527
00:28:23,446 --> 00:28:26,046
and implement a communication

528
00:28:28,486 --> 00:28:30,686
So how does the app

529
00:28:31,216 --> 00:28:34,726
The app's Entitlements.plist

530
00:28:34,726 --> 00:28:37,706
to include the protocol

531
00:28:37,706 --> 00:28:40,206
on the target head

532
00:28:41,176 --> 00:28:44,686
With these additions plus

533
00:28:44,686 --> 00:28:48,326
to communicate with the car,

534
00:28:48,926 --> 00:28:50,696
your app will be

535
00:28:51,416 --> 00:28:54,096
We're looking forward to

536
00:28:54,096 --> 00:28:54,956
from automakers.

537
00:28:57,506 --> 00:29:00,166
We have a new category of

538
00:28:57,506 --> 00:29:00,166
We have a new category of

539
00:29:00,166 --> 00:29:02,326
and iOS10, messaging apps.

540
00:29:03,236 --> 00:29:06,036
When a messaging app has been

541
00:29:06,406 --> 00:29:08,776
that app will appear on

542
00:29:09,606 --> 00:29:11,546
Messages can be received

543
00:29:11,946 --> 00:29:14,056
all driven by Siri interactions.

544
00:29:14,936 --> 00:29:18,656
We're excited to extend CarPlay

545
00:29:18,656 --> 00:29:21,276
making that experience

546
00:29:23,716 --> 00:29:26,436
We hope this has been a

547
00:29:26,856 --> 00:29:29,296
CarPlay is a great way to

548
00:29:29,296 --> 00:29:32,876
in vehicles fresh long into

549
00:29:32,876 --> 00:29:35,396
to get a chance to talk

550
00:29:35,396 --> 00:29:37,076
that are new in iOS 10.

551
00:29:39,496 --> 00:29:44,686
For more information, check

552
00:29:46,486 --> 00:29:49,866
We also have a follow-on

553
00:29:49,866 --> 00:29:50,776
that may interest you.

554
00:29:52,126 --> 00:29:53,066
Thank you for watching.
