to trust a device is to trust

124

And the way we do this is by

00:06:24,836 --> 00:06:31,506
The Apple design system chip

126
00:06:32,066 --> 00:06:33,976

127
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:36,416
of memory called Boot

128
00:06:36,786 --> 00:06:39,106
It's written in the factory and

129
00:06:40,026 --> 00:06:44,266
And when your iOS device

130
00:06:44,926 --> 00:06:48,356
and the Boot ROM will validate

131
00:06:48,586 --> 00:06:49,866
which is the low-level

132
00:06:50,426 --> 00:06:54,066
And only that validation passes

133
00:06:54,066 --> 00:06:59,436
in the chain, and we'll repeat

134
00:06:59,486 --> 00:07:02,696

138
00:07:14,956 --> 00:07:17,746
that we don't rely

to deliver secure boot trust.

140
00:07:19,896 --> 00:07:22,356
We don't rely on

141
00:07:22,356 --> 00:07:23,846

142
00:07:24,606 --> 00:07:27,956

The code that does

145
00:07:30,566 --> 00:07:32,476
that I just showed you

146
00:07:32,526 --> 00:07:35,396
and only Apple is in possession

147
00:07:35,426 --> 00:07:36,596
to sign all the software.

148
00:07:36,816 --> 00:07:40,156
But there is another

149
00:07:40,496 --> 00:07:44,276
which is that when an iOS device

150
00:07:44,276 --> 00:07:45,826
of the software, it has

151
00:07:45,826 --> 00:07:48,916
to contact our installation

152
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:51,766
and ask for permission to

153
00:07:52,076 --> 00:07:54,536
And it does this by taking

154
00:07:54,696 --> 00:07:56,886
of the update, sending

155
00:07:57,126 --> 00:07:58,906
and asking whether

156
00:08:00,136 --> 00:08:03,096
We do this because the

157
00:08:03,186 --> 00:08:07,246
to deny an iOS device the

158
00:08:07,276 --> 00:08:10,566
less secure version of iOS.

159
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:12,746
And so when you put these

160
00:08:12,746 --> 00:08:16,876
you get a strong and trustworthy

161
00:08:16,876 --> 00:08:19,256

162

163
00:08:23,366 --> 00:08:24,376
from one device to another.

It's not possible to

165
00:08:26,676 --> 00:08:27,896
of the software of this process.

166
00:08:27,956 --> 00:08:34,086
Now, let's talk about

167
00:08:35,535 --> 00:08:39,346
If you're really serious about

168
00:08:39,346 --> 00:08:41,726
to take the cryptographic

169
00:08:41,726 --> 00:08:44,226
and make them available to

170
00:08:44,226 --> 00:08:46,436
or the normal processor

171
00:08:46,876 --> 00:08:48,816
That is because the attack

172
00:08:48,846 --> 00:08:49,436
too large.

173
00:08:50,056 --> 00:08:52,336
If you're serious about

174
00:08:52,336 --> 00:08:55,226
you build dedicated silicon that

175
00:08:55,976 --> 00:08:56,526
We've done it.

176
00:08:57,196 --> 00:08:58,446
We call it the secure enclave.

177
00:08:59,316 --> 00:09:02,156
Now, when you think

178
00:08:59,316 --> 00:09:02,156
Now, when you think

179
00:09:02,606 --> 00:09:04,586
normally they're very

180
00:09:05,196 --> 00:09:07,496
And if somehow an

181
00:09:07,496 --> 00:09:11,826
to take the encrypted data off

182
00:09:12,436 --> 00:09:14,696
and attempt every

183
00:09:15,296 --> 00:09:16,466
it wouldn't take them very long.

184
00:09:17,826 --> 00:09:21,236
So what we do instead is we

185
00:09:21,946 --> 00:09:24,586
and we derive a key from

186
00:09:24,586 --> 00:09:26,876
with the hardware key

187
00:09:26,956 --> 00:09:28,076
to our secure enclave.

188
00:09:28,956 --> 00:09:33,106
Which means it's not possible

189
00:09:33,436 --> 00:09:35,966
Passcode guesses must

190
00:09:36,396 --> 00:09:39,386
and the device is free to

191
00:09:40,026 --> 00:09:44,216
In fact, this is exactly

192
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:49,166
After a few incorrect

193
00:09:49,466 --> 00:09:51,036
we start imposing a time delay.

194
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:54,506
But after 10 incorrect

195
00:09:54,506 --> 00:09:57,826
the secure enclave will simply

196
00:10:00,026 --> 00:10:02,076
This has nothing to do with

197
00:10:02,896 --> 00:10:06,106
where if it's on, the data

198
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:07,726
after 10 incorrect

199
00:10:08,136 --> 00:10:09,626
Even if you have

200
00:10:11,576 --> 00:10:13,906
once 10 incorrect

201
00:10:14,296 --> 00:10:16,266
the secure enclave

202
00:10:16,266 --> 00:10:17,976
that device again regardless

203
00:10:20,636 --> 00:10:24,836
So we built the system using

204
00:10:25,826 --> 00:10:28,426
We've subjected it to rigorous

205
00:10:29,156 --> 00:10:30,416
and third-party code review,

206
00:10:30,996 --> 00:10:32,736
and then we've taken

207
00:10:32,736 --> 00:10:35,096
We have taken our core

208
00:10:35,096 --> 00:10:38,626
that underpin data protection,

209
00:10:39,146 --> 00:10:41,126
for everyone to download

210
00:10:42,046 --> 00:10:43,176
Let's talk about sandboxing.

211
00:10:44,326 --> 00:10:48,576
Sandboxing is a method for

212
00:10:49,646 --> 00:10:52,856
This is because even with

213
00:10:52,856 --> 00:10:54,546
developers sometimes

214
00:10:55,226 --> 00:10:58,066
and sandboxing is a

215
00:10:58,066 --> 00:11:00,266
of the potential harm

216
00:10:58,066 --> 00:11:00,266
of the potential harm

217
00:11:00,306 --> 00:11:03,736
It's a little bit like air

218
00:11:04,016 --> 00:11:06,496
which mitigate the risk

219
00:11:08,436 --> 00:11:11,926
We also use sandboxing to

220
00:11:11,926 --> 00:11:14,036
around security directly

221
00:11:14,596 --> 00:11:18,006
We have a mechanism called

222
00:11:18,006 --> 00:11:22,026
and control, where we can ask a

223
00:11:22,026 --> 00:11:23,746
app with some of

224
00:11:23,746 --> 00:11:25,986
like location, photos

225
00:11:26,456 --> 00:11:29,196
And once a user makes a

226
00:11:29,646 --> 00:11:35,616
the sandbox mechanism and the

227
00:11:36,046 --> 00:11:37,166
Another critical element

228
00:11:37,656 --> 00:11:39,756
of our platform security

229
00:11:40,396 --> 00:11:44,696
When an attacker is

230
00:11:44,696 --> 00:11:46,636
the very first step

231
00:11:46,636 --> 00:11:48,126
to get their malicious

232
00:11:50,386 --> 00:11:53,946
Because of this, iOS code

233
00:11:53,946 --> 00:11:54,806
operating system.

234
00:11:55,226 --> 00:11:57,386
It covers every app

235
00:11:58,286 --> 00:12:01,536
In fact, when you go to upload

236
00:11:58,286 --> 00:12:01,536
In fact, when you go to upload

237
00:12:02,066 --> 00:12:04,336
X code will calculate

238
00:12:04,726 --> 00:12:08,166
of every executable and

239
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:11,276
and will write them into a code

240
00:12:11,816 --> 00:12:13,076
which is then sent

241
00:12:13,926 --> 00:12:16,866
When the user then

242
00:12:16,866 --> 00:12:21,336
our kernel will look at every

243
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:23,816
and compare it against the

244
00:12:23,816 --> 00:12:24,976
that it hasn't been

245
00:12:26,706 --> 00:12:30,716
As a result, an attacker can't

246
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:33,826
inject it into memory and then

247
00:12:34,256 --> 00:12:36,676
Instead, they have to

248
00:12:37,136 --> 00:12:39,846
and difficult schemes to get

249
00:12:45,656 --> 00:12:48,586
Let's talk a bit about Touch ID.

250
00:12:48,996 --> 00:12:50,586
We know that for

251
00:12:50,586 --> 00:12:53,506
on average they unlock

252
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:59,496
And if you have a passcode

253
00:12:59,496 --> 00:13:01,516
to each one of those 80 unlocks.

254
00:12:59,496 --> 00:13:01,516
to each one of those 80 unlocks.

255
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:06,766
As a result, almost half

256
00:13:06,766 --> 00:13:09,766
of our users didn't

257
00:13:10,536 --> 00:13:14,616
and we knew that because the

258
00:13:14,616 --> 00:13:17,366
of the key used to protect

259
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:19,176
this is a problem

260
00:13:19,886 --> 00:13:26,656
We needed a solution that

261
00:13:26,656 --> 00:13:28,206
and that provided

262
00:13:28,656 --> 00:13:29,736
to the data of our users.

263
00:13:29,736 --> 00:13:33,976
For us, that solution

264
00:13:35,646 --> 00:13:37,646
But we didn't just take

265
00:13:37,646 --> 00:13:39,626
and put it in a phone.

266
00:13:41,726 --> 00:13:43,096
You can change your passwords,

267
00:13:43,306 --> 00:13:45,516
but you can't change your

268
00:13:45,706 --> 00:13:47,086
You can't change

269
00:13:47,706 --> 00:13:49,496
And so we knew that we had

270
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:51,746
to afford the biometric

271
00:13:51,746 --> 00:13:53,306
of protection we could build.

272
00:13:54,446 --> 00:13:58,396
So what we did was we connected

273
00:13:58,396 --> 00:14:00,716
to the secure enclave,

274
00:13:58,396 --> 00:14:00,716
to the secure enclave,

275
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:04,966
And we made it so that when you

276
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:09,396
that fingerprint is transmitted

277
00:14:09,976 --> 00:14:12,216
where it is processed,

278
00:14:12,806 --> 00:14:16,736
And it's never made available

279
00:14:16,736 --> 00:14:21,456
that runs normal

280
00:14:21,696 --> 00:14:24,216
Now, I mentioned

281
00:14:24,216 --> 00:14:29,296
about half of our users

282
00:14:29,526 --> 00:14:31,456
Now, 9 out of 10 do.

283
00:14:32,796 --> 00:14:35,836
This is a shining example

284
00:14:36,256 --> 00:14:38,546
It takes our hardware

285
00:14:39,106 --> 00:14:41,786
our software engineering

286
00:14:41,786 --> 00:14:45,096
to ease of use, and

287
00:14:45,096 --> 00:14:48,446
where a normal user doesn't

288
00:14:49,136 --> 00:14:51,436
doesn't care about secure

289
00:14:52,846 --> 00:14:55,196
What they get is simply

290
00:14:55,196 --> 00:15:01,066
for the security of their data.

291
00:14:55,196 --> 00:15:01,066
for the security of their data.

292
00:15:01,386 --> 00:15:02,526
The second key pillar

293
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:07,596
of iOS security is users

294
00:15:09,556 --> 00:15:13,626
The latest versions of iOS

295
00:15:14,326 --> 00:15:17,546
and we're constantly

296
00:15:17,546 --> 00:15:19,866
on the threats we see today and

297
00:15:20,766 --> 00:15:23,306
And we've built all

298
00:15:23,306 --> 00:15:27,086
for trusting the software

299
00:15:27,866 --> 00:15:32,546
but it doesn't matter how

300
00:15:32,596 --> 00:15:34,906
if people are not

301
00:15:34,906 --> 00:15:35,936
the one that is most secure.

302
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:39,726
So when we think about

303
00:15:39,726 --> 00:15:41,506
about the device and

304
00:15:41,506 --> 00:15:44,466
it is also about our

305
00:15:44,466 --> 00:15:46,466
and our ability to get

306
00:15:47,186 --> 00:15:48,776
and also the user experience

307
00:15:49,086 --> 00:15:52,366
for how a user sees an

308
00:15:52,906 --> 00:15:58,836
One thing we've done with iOS 9

309
00:15:58,836 --> 00:16:02,056
of space it took to install

310
00:15:58,836 --> 00:16:02,056
of space it took to install

311
00:16:02,056 --> 00:16:05,006
who had relatively little free

312
00:16:05,006 --> 00:16:07,436
and more secure version

313
00:16:09,316 --> 00:16:11,466
We then took a look

314
00:16:12,456 --> 00:16:15,326
and said sometimes users

315
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:17,846
to do an update, so

316
00:16:17,846 --> 00:16:19,436
to install an update

317
00:16:20,046 --> 00:16:21,406
or to install it

318
00:16:21,446 --> 00:16:23,286
when they're probably

319
00:16:23,476 --> 00:16:26,236
or be reminded the next day.

320
00:16:26,476 --> 00:16:29,146
The results are amazing.

321
00:16:30,236 --> 00:16:34,636
Nearly 85% of our customers

322
00:16:34,636 --> 00:16:36,666
of iOS, the most

323
00:16:37,286 --> 00:16:42,416
and if you think this is easy

324
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:43,646
at some of the other

325
00:16:45,426 --> 00:16:50,866
This, by the way, is a fair

326
00:16:50,866 --> 00:16:53,346
and iOS 9 were released

327
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:58,526
of each other, and for some

328
00:16:58,526 --> 00:17:01,906
of Android before 5.1.1 has

329
00:16:58,526 --> 00:17:01,906
of Android before 5.1.1 has

330
00:17:01,906 --> 00:17:04,326
fright, which is

331
00:17:04,326 --> 00:17:07,036
You can exploit it by sending

332
00:17:07,496 --> 00:17:10,046
to a vulnerable device,

333
00:17:10,046 --> 00:17:10,836
over that device.

334
00:17:11,445 --> 00:17:13,746
And Google patched

335
00:17:15,066 --> 00:17:16,836
But it doesn't matter,

336
00:17:16,836 --> 00:17:19,156
of their users don't

337
00:17:20,066 --> 00:17:22,955
And a fix that is not installed

338
00:17:23,165 --> 00:17:26,236
which is why we invest

339
00:17:26,306 --> 00:17:30,096
in building secure versions of

340
00:17:30,096 --> 00:17:33,096
for our users to have that

341
00:17:33,716 --> 00:17:40,586
The third pillar in iOS

342
00:17:41,066 --> 00:17:43,076
using the security

343
00:17:43,186 --> 00:17:45,036
to build secure apps.

344
00:17:46,036 --> 00:17:50,686
This means following best

345
00:17:50,686 --> 00:17:54,456
We have an amazing number of

346
00:17:55,556 --> 00:17:59,436
to save their users from having

347
00:17:59,436 --> 00:18:02,826
and type them directly into

348
00:17:59,436 --> 00:18:02,826
and type them directly into

349
00:18:02,826 --> 00:18:05,186
we introduced a feature

350
00:18:06,026 --> 00:18:10,546
that provides strong protection

351
00:18:10,546 --> 00:18:12,986
across the network to

352
00:18:15,776 --> 00:18:19,016
Today I'm proud to say

353
00:18:19,016 --> 00:18:21,666
App Transport Security

354
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:22,656
for App Store apps.

355
00:18:24,146 --> 00:18:28,326
This means that by the end of

356
00:18:28,326 --> 00:18:30,746
with your own server

357
00:18:30,746 --> 00:18:35,756
so using a secure TLS

358
00:18:35,996 --> 00:18:39,446
unless the data being

359
00:18:39,446 --> 00:18:42,266
such as media streaming and

360
00:18:43,206 --> 00:18:46,266
This is going to provide a

361
00:18:46,266 --> 00:18:49,396
for our users, and

362
00:18:49,396 --> 00:18:50,966
that your apps have

363
00:18:52,856 --> 00:18:57,116
There is another piece of

364
00:18:57,116 --> 00:18:59,236
on you, the developers,

365
00:18:59,236 --> 00:19:01,716
and this is to know your code,

366
00:18:59,236 --> 00:19:01,716
and this is to know your code,

367
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:04,516
but also any third-party

368
00:19:04,516 --> 00:19:05,816
in your apps.

369
00:19:06,496 --> 00:19:10,586
This is the because libraries

370
00:19:10,586 --> 00:19:11,466
security of your app.

371
00:19:12,256 --> 00:19:14,266
Maybe because they're doing

372
00:19:14,266 --> 00:19:15,146
of behind your back.

373
00:19:16,156 --> 00:19:20,546
But maybe because

374
00:19:20,546 --> 00:19:22,036
and more secure version

375
00:19:22,886 --> 00:19:25,606
There is kind of an

376
00:19:25,606 --> 00:19:29,206
where there is a very popular

377
00:19:29,886 --> 00:19:33,046
that had a critical

378
00:19:33,116 --> 00:19:36,616
of security for TLS connections.

379
00:19:37,136 --> 00:19:40,886
And this flaw was patched

380
00:19:40,886 --> 00:19:44,166
of time, there were up to

381
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:46,666
that didn't have that

382
00:19:48,146 --> 00:19:51,126
So it's really important that

383
00:19:51,126 --> 00:19:54,266
from trustworthy locations,

384
00:19:54,606 --> 00:19:55,706
and that you keep it current.

385
00:19:56,366 --> 00:19:59,976
So these are our three key

386
00:20:00,686 --> 00:20:03,986
Platform security, which are

387
00:20:03,986 --> 00:20:06,506
mechanisms that we can build

388
00:20:07,186 --> 00:20:10,766
Our users who download the

389
00:20:10,766 --> 00:20:12,126
of iOS and developers like you,

390
00:20:12,126 --> 00:20:15,236
using our security technologies

391
00:20:15,836 --> 00:20:20,656
And it's a fair question to

392
00:20:21,946 --> 00:20:23,356
How good is iOS security?

393
00:20:24,736 --> 00:20:27,686
Security is interesting,

394
00:20:28,116 --> 00:20:29,236
you can't measure it directly.

395
00:20:29,236 --> 00:20:31,246
You can't run a test, and

396
00:20:31,246 --> 00:20:32,656
to get an objective answer.

397
00:20:33,936 --> 00:20:38,276
So what you're left with

398
00:20:39,396 --> 00:20:42,676
And I have three that

399
00:20:44,856 --> 00:20:50,096
The first one is that after

400
00:20:50,326 --> 00:20:52,816
there has still not

401
00:20:52,816 --> 00:20:54,996
of iOS malware affecting

402
00:20:56,266 --> 00:20:58,536
This one is the one that

403
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:01,876
Our users have been

404
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:01,876
Our users have been

405
00:21:01,876 --> 00:21:03,016
for nearly 10 years.

406
00:21:06,536 --> 00:21:09,456
The next indirect metric that is

407
00:21:09,456 --> 00:21:11,916
of the unfettered jailbreaks

408
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:15,666
These are jailbreaks that

409
00:21:16,836 --> 00:21:19,956
and what is interesting

410
00:21:19,956 --> 00:21:23,086
that the latest launch we've

411
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:25,426
to find and chain

412
00:21:25,426 --> 00:21:28,386
and ten distinct vulnerabilities

413
00:21:28,386 --> 00:21:30,686
to defeat platform

414
00:21:31,906 --> 00:21:33,986
This is much higher than

415
00:21:34,816 --> 00:21:38,716
And the reason is because iOS

416
00:21:38,716 --> 00:21:41,956
in lock step in such a

417
00:21:41,956 --> 00:21:48,036
of them takes a long

418
00:21:48,226 --> 00:21:50,216
For my last indirect metric,

419
00:21:50,776 --> 00:21:52,196
I want you to take it

420
00:21:54,016 --> 00:21:57,056
As probably most of you

421
00:21:57,556 --> 00:21:58,956
for software vulnerabilities.

422
00:22:00,256 --> 00:22:02,796
And every once in a

423
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:05,316
on the black market

424
00:22:06,866 --> 00:22:10,336
Usually these prices are

425
00:22:10,336 --> 00:22:11,586
sometimes a hundred thousand.

426
00:22:11,586 --> 00:22:15,876
But in 2013, the New

427
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:21,186
that an iOS vulnerability sold

428
00:22:22,086 --> 00:22:25,226
Forbes interviewed a

429
00:22:25,226 --> 00:22:28,366
that most experts agree

430
00:22:28,986 --> 00:22:33,036
of an unfettered iOS

431
00:22:37,516 --> 00:22:38,906
Take that with a grain of salt,

432
00:22:38,906 --> 00:22:41,286
but it's a fascinating

433
00:22:43,016 --> 00:22:49,946
So where does this leave us?

434
00:22:50,656 --> 00:22:53,586
Clearly, security is a

435
00:22:54,326 --> 00:22:57,066
We're not done with iOS

436
00:22:58,986 --> 00:23:01,716
It's also not something that we

437
00:22:58,986 --> 00:23:01,716
It's also not something that we

438
00:23:01,716 --> 00:23:04,906
What you're seeing now

439
00:23:04,906 --> 00:23:07,116
of our best work in

440
00:23:08,436 --> 00:23:11,076
But the bad guys

441
00:23:11,766 --> 00:23:14,016
and we will constantly

442
00:23:14,706 --> 00:23:16,786
to defeat not only

443
00:23:16,786 --> 00:23:18,086
but also the threats

444
00:23:19,526 --> 00:23:21,786
We will take our

445
00:23:21,786 --> 00:23:23,026
and our software expertise,

446
00:23:23,156 --> 00:23:25,426
and we will build the

447
00:23:25,426 --> 00:23:29,136
that we can imagine to

448
00:23:29,136 --> 00:23:31,116
and how they use their

449
00:23:31,246 --> 00:23:32,856
and also how they'll

450
00:23:34,176 --> 00:23:36,826
and protect our customers

451
00:23:37,956 --> 00:23:42,016
and tomorrow's, even if

452
00:23:44,416 --> 00:23:45,426
Thank you very much.
