00:00:25,046 --> 00:00:26,476
&gt;&gt; Hello everybody.

4
00:00:26,596 --> 00:00:27,776
Hello again if you just came

5
00:00:27,776 --> 00:00:29,476
from the previous session,

6
00:00:29,836 --> 00:00:30,786
And hello if you're new.

7
00:00:30,786 --> 00:00:31,926
Hello to everyone downstairs,

8
00:00:31,926 --> 00:00:33,886
and hello to everyone

9
00:00:34,276 --> 00:00:38,036
My name is Nick, I'm joined

10
00:00:38,636 --> 00:00:40,516
and we're going to

11
00:00:40,766 --> 00:00:42,166
with Wallet and Apple Pay.

12
00:00:44,326 --> 00:00:46,816
First of all, we're going to

13
00:00:47,376 --> 00:00:49,396
We're going to talk

14
00:00:49,396 --> 00:00:51,156
We're going to talk

15
00:00:51,156 --> 00:00:52,626
for banks and for retailers.

16
00:00:52,906 --> 00:00:55,186
And then we're going

17
00:00:55,456 --> 00:00:58,626
now you can use Apple Pay

18
00:00:58,626 --> 00:01:02,106
on Apple Watch, but also

19
00:00:58,626 --> 00:01:02,106
on Apple Watch, but also

20
00:01:03,236 --> 00:01:05,525
We'll also talk about something

21
00:01:05,606 --> 00:01:11,096
and that's the new extensions on

22
00:01:11,366 --> 00:01:12,866
All of these new

23
00:01:13,126 --> 00:01:14,846
that can be enabled

24
00:01:15,206 --> 00:01:18,576
And finally we'll talk about

25
00:01:18,576 --> 00:01:21,046
I think you're all going

26
00:01:21,096 --> 00:01:23,036
and the new Sandbox environment.

27
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:25,416
Let's get started.

28
00:01:26,996 --> 00:01:28,886
What's new with PassKit.

29
00:01:30,276 --> 00:01:31,996
So, hopefully you'll be aware

30
00:01:31,996 --> 00:01:36,346
that Wallet isn't just Apple

31
00:01:36,896 --> 00:01:40,156
And there's no better

32
00:01:40,526 --> 00:01:43,516
because more users are

33
00:01:43,516 --> 00:01:45,226
than ever, due to Apple Pay.

34
00:01:45,306 --> 00:01:47,126
More people are opening

35
00:01:47,126 --> 00:01:48,196
more people are using it.

36
00:01:48,276 --> 00:01:53,336
Now, we don't have time today to

37
00:01:53,756 --> 00:01:55,466
but we do have some

38
00:01:55,956 --> 00:01:57,896
I'll tell you a little bit

39
00:01:58,076 --> 00:01:59,286
don't worry, not too much.

40
00:01:59,736 --> 00:02:03,656
Passes enable you to get

41
00:01:59,736 --> 00:02:03,656
Passes enable you to get

42
00:02:03,826 --> 00:02:07,416
rewards cards, event

43
00:02:07,816 --> 00:02:12,656
and more directly into the

44
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:15,286
And you can distribute

45
00:02:15,316 --> 00:02:16,896
through an app, through email,

46
00:02:17,386 --> 00:02:20,086
SMS or iMessage,

47
00:02:20,086 --> 00:02:22,926
And these passes can

48
00:02:22,926 --> 00:02:25,326
And these updates show up

49
00:02:26,356 --> 00:02:30,416
Things like date changes, for

50
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:33,146
Your passes can be relevant,

51
00:02:33,146 --> 00:02:34,266
they'll show up on

52
00:02:34,896 --> 00:02:37,096
We have a session that talks

53
00:02:37,096 --> 00:02:39,356
of these passes and provides

54
00:02:39,596 --> 00:02:41,216
It's the home for

55
00:02:41,216 --> 00:02:42,206
it was last year's session.

56
00:02:42,396 --> 00:02:44,186
And there's plenty

57
00:02:44,186 --> 00:02:45,636
at developer.apple.com.

58
00:02:46,106 --> 00:02:49,186
Let me talk now about

59
00:02:49,276 --> 00:02:51,076
Some things we've

60
00:02:51,236 --> 00:02:52,266
that maybe you didn't notice.

61
00:02:53,346 --> 00:02:54,736
One of them was app placement.

62
00:02:54,736 --> 00:02:56,866
We've actually changed the

63
00:02:56,866 --> 00:02:58,796
this happened in iOS 9.3.

64
00:02:59,336 --> 00:03:02,836
Apps are now placed

65
00:02:59,336 --> 00:03:02,836
Apps are now placed

66
00:03:03,246 --> 00:03:06,056
and these app icons

67
00:03:06,056 --> 00:03:07,706
into your applications.

68
00:03:08,036 --> 00:03:11,586
So these are great for

69
00:03:12,236 --> 00:03:14,966
if you're a gift card pass

70
00:03:14,966 --> 00:03:17,586
for the user to quickly

71
00:03:17,586 --> 00:03:18,776
you want to go to the app

72
00:03:18,776 --> 00:03:20,296
for more information

73
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:24,546
And it's very easy to add this,

74
00:03:24,956 --> 00:03:30,046
to your pass, the apps ID,

75
00:03:30,046 --> 00:03:36,496
and also its URL scheme to deep

76
00:03:36,496 --> 00:03:39,356
Last year we also

77
00:03:39,936 --> 00:03:41,406
the value-added services pass.

78
00:03:41,406 --> 00:03:47,016
So passes can now transmit

79
00:03:47,316 --> 00:03:49,426
Things like loyalty

80
00:03:49,456 --> 00:03:52,996
if you're in the US you might

81
00:03:53,206 --> 00:03:54,916
which lets you transmit

82
00:03:54,966 --> 00:03:57,996
And support for value-added

83
00:03:57,996 --> 00:04:00,516
over the past year for many

84
00:03:57,996 --> 00:04:00,516
over the past year for many

85
00:04:00,836 --> 00:04:03,946
Verifone, Ingenico and

86
00:04:03,946 --> 00:04:07,086
of payment terminals now

87
00:04:07,636 --> 00:04:09,486
There's some things

88
00:04:09,486 --> 00:04:11,406
about value-added

89
00:04:11,736 --> 00:04:14,826
they also support what we

90
00:04:15,146 --> 00:04:16,286
It looks a little like this.

91
00:04:16,286 --> 00:04:18,346
It's where you actually

92
00:04:18,346 --> 00:04:19,586
on the payment terminal

93
00:04:19,856 --> 00:04:22,036
and you'll transmit both

94
00:04:22,516 --> 00:04:25,746
and your loyalty

95
00:04:26,146 --> 00:04:29,096
So it's deeply integrated

96
00:04:29,376 --> 00:04:31,876
This also works with

97
00:04:35,636 --> 00:04:38,786
Now these value-added service

98
00:04:38,786 --> 00:04:42,766
over NFC, and you can even

99
00:04:42,766 --> 00:04:45,536
from these NFC distributed

100
00:04:46,006 --> 00:04:47,806
to be shared and personalized.

101
00:04:48,086 --> 00:04:50,856
You can actually sign up for

102
00:04:56,106 --> 00:04:59,386
Now, there are a few caveats to

103
00:04:59,546 --> 00:05:01,836
One of them you might be

104
00:04:59,546 --> 00:05:01,836
One of them you might be

105
00:05:01,836 --> 00:05:03,956
to be signed using a

106
00:05:04,276 --> 00:05:06,456
Regular passes are signed

107
00:05:06,456 --> 00:05:09,356
at the developer portal, but

108
00:05:09,356 --> 00:05:12,076
to be signed with an

109
00:05:12,946 --> 00:05:14,926
Now, you need to request

110
00:05:14,926 --> 00:05:16,536
You can contact us

111
00:05:16,536 --> 00:05:17,746
I'm actually going

112
00:05:17,746 --> 00:05:19,236
at the end of this presentation.

113
00:05:19,506 --> 00:05:22,066
So you can go and

114
00:05:22,066 --> 00:05:23,406
about using value-added

115
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:25,956
And we're also going to have

116
00:05:25,956 --> 00:05:28,036
We got a lab right

117
00:05:28,516 --> 00:05:30,536
so if you have any

118
00:05:30,606 --> 00:05:31,526
we'd love to talk to you.

119
00:05:31,756 --> 00:05:37,216
Let's talk about a few other

120
00:05:37,216 --> 00:05:39,546
Now these are specific

121
00:05:39,546 --> 00:05:40,646
but I think they're

122
00:05:40,646 --> 00:05:41,996
even if you're not

123
00:05:41,996 --> 00:05:45,056
you might be interested

124
00:05:45,056 --> 00:05:46,876
We offer some unique features

125
00:05:46,876 --> 00:05:49,056
for card issuers

126
00:05:50,836 --> 00:05:54,386
We also now support store

127
00:05:54,536 --> 00:05:55,606
Here's a Kohl's card.

128
00:05:55,866 --> 00:05:57,686
So if you have a store

129
00:05:57,686 --> 00:06:00,366
So these aren't just for banks,

130
00:05:57,686 --> 00:06:00,366
So these aren't just for banks,

131
00:06:01,146 --> 00:06:04,356
One really great feature

132
00:06:04,576 --> 00:06:06,486
Now, we added this

133
00:06:06,486 --> 00:06:09,986
of apps have already adopted

134
00:06:10,246 --> 00:06:11,586
This lets you set up cards

135
00:06:11,586 --> 00:06:14,436
in Apple Pay directly

136
00:06:14,436 --> 00:06:16,176
You never need to leave you app,

137
00:06:16,176 --> 00:06:18,516
to open Wallet, to

138
00:06:18,926 --> 00:06:22,486
And it's available to any

139
00:06:22,656 --> 00:06:27,146
Now the API is documented

140
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:29,816
But you can also contact

141
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:31,946
We actually have an email

142
00:06:31,946 --> 00:06:35,036
at the end, and we're going to

143
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:38,456
We also have this

144
00:06:38,456 --> 00:06:40,946
which you can use

145
00:06:40,946 --> 00:06:43,226
but also for adding

146
00:06:43,296 --> 00:06:44,846
So if you're just

147
00:06:44,846 --> 00:06:47,306
you can use the new

148
00:06:47,306 --> 00:06:47,936
showing you here.

149
00:06:48,256 --> 00:06:50,696
I'll have some codes to show

150
00:06:52,086 --> 00:06:56,276
Now something that's new

151
00:06:56,356 --> 00:06:59,956
for card issuers and retailers

152
00:06:59,956 --> 00:07:03,006
either co-branded cards, or

153
00:06:59,956 --> 00:07:03,006
either co-branded cards, or

154
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:06,106
with a bank, we now

155
00:07:06,106 --> 00:07:07,326
in-store experience.

156
00:07:07,386 --> 00:07:10,656
You can present your cards

157
00:07:11,016 --> 00:07:15,176
A really good use case of

158
00:07:15,276 --> 00:07:18,006
from your app and immediately

159
00:07:18,006 --> 00:07:20,956
So maybe your app is

160
00:07:20,956 --> 00:07:22,556
it's got a great

161
00:07:22,556 --> 00:07:25,556
So you go into the store, you

162
00:07:25,816 --> 00:07:28,106
you just press a button

163
00:07:28,106 --> 00:07:28,736
with Apple Pay.

164
00:07:28,926 --> 00:07:30,236
The card could be right

165
00:07:30,756 --> 00:07:32,626
It's a really easy API to use.

166
00:07:33,316 --> 00:07:34,576
It's just on the Pass Library.

167
00:07:36,286 --> 00:07:38,916
And you can use the new

168
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,176
for some consistent branding.

169
00:07:40,546 --> 00:07:43,166
And this is the style .inStore.

170
00:07:43,616 --> 00:07:46,106
We have another style I

171
00:07:46,106 --> 00:07:49,306
to different class actually,

172
00:07:49,306 --> 00:07:50,116
but take a look

173
00:07:50,116 --> 00:07:51,676
at the documentation

174
00:07:52,976 --> 00:07:58,016
Another feature that's pretty

175
00:07:58,016 --> 00:07:59,956
applications with your cards.

176
00:08:00,286 --> 00:08:01,956
Again, this is great

177
00:08:02,186 --> 00:08:04,516
and you have a co-branded

178
00:08:04,586 --> 00:08:08,366
with an issuing bank, you

179
00:08:08,366 --> 00:08:10,056
with your store or

180
00:08:10,336 --> 00:08:13,416
which means it can default,

181
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:15,936
Here's the screen you'll

182
00:08:15,936 --> 00:08:17,946
but it's the same

183
00:08:18,856 --> 00:08:21,316
You can default your card

184
00:08:21,316 --> 00:08:23,986
or new in iOS 10

185
00:08:24,176 --> 00:08:25,956
when paying with an application.

186
00:08:25,956 --> 00:08:28,396
And also a website if

187
00:08:28,396 --> 00:08:29,876
of the new Apple Pay

188
00:08:30,046 --> 00:08:34,236
Now the great thing about most

189
00:08:34,306 --> 00:08:36,155
It's actually built

190
00:08:36,496 --> 00:08:40,456
All you need to do is get

191
00:08:40,456 --> 00:08:43,775
and URL scheme into the pass

192
00:08:44,176 --> 00:08:46,516
Now to do that you can

193
00:08:46,516 --> 00:08:48,216
or if you're an issuing

194
00:08:48,216 --> 00:08:50,446
to us using the contact

195
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:53,616
of the session, or come

196
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:56,726
So that's some of the

197
00:08:56,726 --> 00:09:01,466
I want to talk now about Apple

198
00:08:56,726 --> 00:09:01,466
I want to talk now about Apple

199
00:09:01,796 --> 00:09:04,706
And I also want to tell you

200
00:09:05,866 --> 00:09:09,526
So Apple Pay is an easy,

201
00:09:09,526 --> 00:09:14,356
to pay both in-store

202
00:09:14,976 --> 00:09:17,156
And it's got amazing

203
00:09:17,296 --> 00:09:19,566
It has one of the highest

204
00:09:19,566 --> 00:09:20,576
of any payment method.

205
00:09:21,066 --> 00:09:25,416
And Apple Pay is usable

206
00:09:25,866 --> 00:09:29,656
You can pay using Apple

207
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:32,846
And thousands of apps have

208
00:09:33,256 --> 00:09:36,656
in the US, in China,

209
00:09:36,966 --> 00:09:38,496
We've recently announced

210
00:09:38,496 --> 00:09:40,286
in France, also Australia.

211
00:09:40,286 --> 00:09:42,766
We've got many countries

212
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:46,436
And millions of users are

213
00:09:46,746 --> 00:09:50,376
And we've seen incredible growth

214
00:09:50,376 --> 00:09:51,626
and within applications.

215
00:09:51,846 --> 00:09:54,716
And developers such as

216
00:09:54,716 --> 00:09:55,486
results too.

217
00:09:56,276 --> 00:09:58,896
Here's two apps that

218
00:09:58,896 --> 00:10:00,016
One of them is Chairish.

219
00:09:58,896 --> 00:10:00,016
One of them is Chairish.

220
00:10:01,046 --> 00:10:02,216
Now the Chairish app, they found

221
00:10:02,216 --> 00:10:04,996
that when they used Apple Pay

222
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:06,526
from other payment methods.

223
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,166
That's a huge increase.

224
00:10:08,376 --> 00:10:09,826
I can't think of

225
00:10:09,826 --> 00:10:11,736
that has such great results.

226
00:10:12,266 --> 00:10:15,796
And StubHub in their

227
00:10:15,796 --> 00:10:19,766
that Apple Pay was driving

228
00:10:19,826 --> 00:10:21,056
than any other payment method.

229
00:10:21,336 --> 00:10:23,576
So this isn't just for

230
00:10:23,696 --> 00:10:26,776
Apple Pay can bring you

231
00:10:27,036 --> 00:10:29,336
Apple Pay apps are often

232
00:10:29,336 --> 00:10:30,256
in their own sections.

233
00:10:30,436 --> 00:10:33,466
We often run promotions

234
00:10:33,676 --> 00:10:35,466
We've also seen some

235
00:10:35,466 --> 00:10:36,906
of the new countries

236
00:10:37,596 --> 00:10:39,816
One country I want to

237
00:10:40,756 --> 00:10:43,166
We've seen some great

238
00:10:43,266 --> 00:10:45,686
I was so lucky to go to

239
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:47,426
and taught some developers

240
00:10:47,726 --> 00:10:49,396
and they've seen some

241
00:10:50,086 --> 00:10:52,636
Apple Pay in China

242
00:10:52,636 --> 00:10:55,386
for China UnionPay

243
00:10:55,866 --> 00:10:59,686
And the Apple Pay API

244
00:10:59,966 --> 00:11:04,686
that's China Union Pay, PayEase,

245
00:10:59,966 --> 00:11:04,686
that's China Union Pay, PayEase,

246
00:11:04,686 --> 00:11:07,526
These are major Chinese

247
00:11:07,746 --> 00:11:12,286
We also have documentation

248
00:11:12,286 --> 00:11:15,716
and our Getting Started Guide

249
00:11:15,936 --> 00:11:18,066
they're also now

250
00:11:18,066 --> 00:11:19,456
now that we're launching

251
00:11:19,686 --> 00:11:22,486
You can check out our developer

252
00:11:22,486 --> 00:11:28,376
Now I want to talk about some

253
00:11:28,376 --> 00:11:30,396
for Apple Pay already,

254
00:11:30,746 --> 00:11:32,326
you're probably really

255
00:11:32,516 --> 00:11:36,306
One of the problems with

256
00:11:36,306 --> 00:11:38,466
to set your networks upfront.

257
00:11:39,296 --> 00:11:41,106
You need to tell us the

258
00:11:41,106 --> 00:11:42,046
in your payment request.

259
00:11:42,046 --> 00:11:44,316
So that's hard coded

260
00:11:46,126 --> 00:11:48,596
And adding new networks

261
00:11:48,646 --> 00:11:52,526
You either have to perform SDK

262
00:11:52,526 --> 00:11:55,386
if the constants are

263
00:11:55,386 --> 00:11:57,716
to hack something

264
00:11:58,806 --> 00:12:01,886
And for those of you who

265
00:11:58,806 --> 00:12:01,886
And for those of you who

266
00:12:01,886 --> 00:12:04,226
remember when we launched

267
00:12:04,566 --> 00:12:07,986
last year, unless you

268
00:12:07,986 --> 00:12:09,496
you probably weren't

269
00:12:09,496 --> 00:12:10,826
if your payment processor could.

270
00:12:10,826 --> 00:12:14,936
So we're introducing something

271
00:12:15,476 --> 00:12:16,996
it's dynamic networks

272
00:12:17,726 --> 00:12:19,996
Firstly, we're adding

273
00:12:19,996 --> 00:12:21,426
onto PKPaymentRequest.

274
00:12:21,576 --> 00:12:23,506
It's going to tell you

275
00:12:23,506 --> 00:12:25,066
that are available

276
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:27,836
There's PKPaymentRequest

277
00:12:28,306 --> 00:12:30,426
We're also going to

278
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:33,526
You're going to be able

279
00:12:33,526 --> 00:12:34,876
as supported networks.

280
00:12:35,136 --> 00:12:37,536
And these proxy down

281
00:12:37,536 --> 00:12:40,026
So for example, if my payment

282
00:12:40,026 --> 00:12:43,356
MasterCard, AmEx and it's

283
00:12:43,356 --> 00:12:45,356
in as the supported

284
00:12:45,356 --> 00:12:46,516
of the networks automatically.

285
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:49,216
And perhaps most importantly,

286
00:12:49,286 --> 00:12:51,976
as they're added to Apple Pay

287
00:12:51,976 --> 00:12:55,346
So you can check our

288
00:12:55,346 --> 00:12:57,946
about payment processes that are

289
00:12:58,766 --> 00:13:01,306
It's a really cool feature,

290
00:12:58,766 --> 00:13:01,306
It's a really cool feature,

291
00:13:01,306 --> 00:13:05,196
of pain I think for writing

292
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:11,486
One other thing we've changed, I

293
00:13:11,756 --> 00:13:15,486
maybe you've already seen some

294
00:13:15,486 --> 00:13:17,716
We have improved our

295
00:13:18,016 --> 00:13:19,976
We've actually completely

296
00:13:20,136 --> 00:13:21,116
talk about that later.

297
00:13:21,506 --> 00:13:23,776
One change that's coming,

298
00:13:23,776 --> 00:13:24,856
but it will be in seed two.

299
00:13:24,856 --> 00:13:27,766
PassKit now uses stringly

300
00:13:28,256 --> 00:13:31,346
If you're not sure what those

301
00:13:31,346 --> 00:13:33,366
in Swift to take string

302
00:13:33,366 --> 00:13:35,246
into enums, which is

303
00:13:35,246 --> 00:13:37,186
for Apple Pay a lot easier.

304
00:13:37,186 --> 00:13:43,076
Now let's talk about

305
00:13:44,376 --> 00:13:47,806
This year we've got

306
00:13:48,136 --> 00:13:49,946
where we're adding

307
00:13:50,906 --> 00:13:54,286
We're adding support to

308
00:13:54,826 --> 00:13:58,506
And we're adding support to

309
00:13:59,216 --> 00:14:02,126
And finally we're

310
00:13:59,216 --> 00:14:02,126
And finally we're

311
00:14:02,426 --> 00:14:06,016
both on MacOS Sierra

312
00:14:07,256 --> 00:14:10,256
Now we just talked about

313
00:14:10,436 --> 00:14:11,526
It's online right now.

314
00:14:11,796 --> 00:14:12,686
You can check it out.

315
00:14:14,056 --> 00:14:18,056
Let's focus today, right

316
00:14:18,716 --> 00:14:20,656
I'm going to start

317
00:14:21,296 --> 00:14:23,986
And to talk more about WatchKit

318
00:14:23,986 --> 00:14:27,736
to integrate Apple Pay on to

319
00:14:28,036 --> 00:14:29,746
from the WatchKit

320
00:14:29,986 --> 00:14:30,246
Leo.

321
00:14:31,516 --> 00:14:37,546
[ Applause ]

322
00:14:38,046 --> 00:14:38,766
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Nick.

323
00:14:39,006 --> 00:14:39,786
Hello everyone.

324
00:14:40,126 --> 00:14:41,906
My name is Leo and I'm

325
00:14:41,906 --> 00:14:42,946
on the Apple Watch team.

326
00:14:43,646 --> 00:14:45,656
I'm really excited to tell

327
00:14:45,656 --> 00:14:47,396
with Apple Pay on

328
00:14:48,316 --> 00:14:51,336
We're adding support for making

329
00:14:52,296 --> 00:14:54,186
We think this is going to

330
00:14:54,236 --> 00:14:55,116
of apps on the watch.

331
00:14:55,476 --> 00:14:56,936
And the great news

332
00:14:57,236 --> 00:14:59,746
if you have implemented

333
00:15:00,376 --> 00:15:02,096
the same code with

334
00:15:02,346 --> 00:15:03,526
with very minimal changes.

335
00:15:03,846 --> 00:15:05,996
So let's take a look at what

336
00:15:06,356 --> 00:15:09,446
First we're going

337
00:15:09,446 --> 00:15:10,966
on how payments work

338
00:15:11,266 --> 00:15:13,876
I'm going to show you how to

339
00:15:13,876 --> 00:15:14,976
to present a payment sheet.

340
00:15:14,976 --> 00:15:17,186
And then we're going

341
00:15:17,266 --> 00:15:19,576
So you get an idea of how

342
00:15:19,746 --> 00:15:20,806
with Apple Pay on the Watch.

343
00:15:21,846 --> 00:15:23,576
Finally, we're going

344
00:15:23,576 --> 00:15:25,866
of the design considerations

345
00:15:26,046 --> 00:15:28,096
when designing specifically

346
00:15:28,496 --> 00:15:30,796
This is the Apply Pay experience

347
00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:32,936
that your users are

348
00:15:33,706 --> 00:15:34,816
Now let's bring up the watch.

349
00:15:35,376 --> 00:15:39,326
The first thing you notice is

350
00:15:39,976 --> 00:15:41,346
We only display the total amount

351
00:15:41,346 --> 00:15:42,526
and the merchant

352
00:15:42,996 --> 00:15:45,176
And users can simply

353
00:15:45,176 --> 00:15:46,156
to pay at any time.

354
00:15:46,736 --> 00:15:49,086
If they want to make

355
00:15:49,086 --> 00:15:50,956
or review their information,

356
00:15:50,956 --> 00:15:53,206
And they can have access to

357
00:15:53,576 --> 00:15:56,326
as well as shipping, billing

358
00:15:56,976 --> 00:15:59,316
And they can see a detail

359
00:15:59,766 --> 00:16:02,306
When they're ready to pay,

360
00:15:59,766 --> 00:16:02,306
When they're ready to pay,

361
00:16:02,996 --> 00:16:05,676
they simply double click the

362
00:16:06,406 --> 00:16:07,416
It is that simple.

363
00:16:08,646 --> 00:16:10,916
Now let's take a look

364
00:16:11,146 --> 00:16:12,356
from a developer's

365
00:16:13,596 --> 00:16:16,046
We follow the same flow that

366
00:16:16,736 --> 00:16:19,986
First you create a payment

367
00:16:20,156 --> 00:16:21,766
to a payment authorization

368
00:16:22,746 --> 00:16:24,576
This is the object that

369
00:16:24,646 --> 00:16:25,456
on our platform.

370
00:16:25,836 --> 00:16:28,216
As the user interact

371
00:16:28,216 --> 00:16:29,936
we're going to call

372
00:16:30,066 --> 00:16:33,756
for example in the payment

373
00:16:34,376 --> 00:16:37,146
And you may use this opportunity

374
00:16:37,486 --> 00:16:39,386
For example, you may not

375
00:16:39,386 --> 00:16:40,126
to some countries.

376
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,306
Or you may want to

377
00:16:42,306 --> 00:16:43,746
and the total amount on the UI.

378
00:16:43,746 --> 00:16:47,326
When the user confirms

379
00:16:47,566 --> 00:16:49,946
we talk to the secure

380
00:16:50,446 --> 00:16:52,616
and we issue a payment

381
00:16:52,696 --> 00:16:53,626
to process the payment.

382
00:16:55,236 --> 00:16:57,596
Now refer everyone to

383
00:16:58,216 --> 00:16:59,486
there is some setup

384
00:16:59,486 --> 00:17:02,096
to enable Apple Pay

385
00:16:59,486 --> 00:17:02,096
to enable Apple Pay

386
00:17:02,096 --> 00:17:04,126
First, you want to go

387
00:17:04,126 --> 00:17:06,876
and register a merchant

388
00:17:07,955 --> 00:17:09,776
You may have done this

389
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:13,036
And then you want

390
00:17:13,246 --> 00:17:15,215
for your WatchKit

391
00:17:15,915 --> 00:17:17,336
And there are step

392
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:20,486
on our website on

393
00:17:20,656 --> 00:17:21,846
Now let's take a

394
00:17:23,046 --> 00:17:25,276
This is how you create

395
00:17:25,856 --> 00:17:28,786
We use the same PKPaymentRequest

396
00:17:29,606 --> 00:17:32,486
You create one of this and

397
00:17:32,486 --> 00:17:34,926
and currency code, your

398
00:17:34,926 --> 00:17:37,766
and the payment network sync

399
00:17:38,706 --> 00:17:41,116
And then you specify a

400
00:17:41,296 --> 00:17:42,946
that describe what the

401
00:17:44,556 --> 00:17:46,276
Always remember that

402
00:17:46,276 --> 00:17:47,956
on the list represents

403
00:17:48,346 --> 00:17:51,316
And we recommend that you use

404
00:17:51,496 --> 00:17:56,086
since we display that at the

405
00:17:56,236 --> 00:17:57,726
When you want to

406
00:17:57,956 --> 00:18:00,136
you create a PKPayment

407
00:17:57,956 --> 00:18:00,136
you create a PKPayment

408
00:18:00,316 --> 00:18:02,386
and you pass in the request

409
00:18:03,806 --> 00:18:06,856
Then you designate yourself or

410
00:18:07,226 --> 00:18:10,806
and you simply code present.

411
00:18:10,806 --> 00:18:12,386
Now, since you're

412
00:18:12,386 --> 00:18:14,086
you're also responsible

413
00:18:14,556 --> 00:18:16,136
So make sure to do

414
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:18,466
to payment authorization

415
00:18:18,606 --> 00:18:19,266
in your delegate.

416
00:18:22,546 --> 00:18:25,336
So PKPayment

417
00:18:25,506 --> 00:18:27,956
This is a new controller

418
00:18:27,956 --> 00:18:29,066
in the PassKit.framework.

419
00:18:30,286 --> 00:18:31,176
It is responsible

420
00:18:31,176 --> 00:18:32,966
for controlling the

421
00:18:33,566 --> 00:18:35,426
And it has the same

422
00:18:35,426 --> 00:18:38,036
as of PKPaymentAuthorization

423
00:18:38,456 --> 00:18:40,396
But since it's not

424
00:18:40,836 --> 00:18:42,626
it allows for presentation

425
00:18:42,936 --> 00:18:44,216
from your WatchKit extension.

426
00:18:45,276 --> 00:18:47,736
It is supported across

427
00:18:47,736 --> 00:18:51,376
so you can share your user

428
00:18:51,476 --> 00:18:53,866
and across different platforms.

429
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:55,936
Now, let's put all of this

430
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,136
So I have been working on

431
00:18:59,386 --> 00:19:02,076
so that users can order and

432
00:18:59,386 --> 00:19:02,076
so that users can order and

433
00:19:02,076 --> 00:19:04,476
on their watch and have it

434
00:19:05,336 --> 00:19:07,486
Let's take a look at

435
00:19:10,956 --> 00:19:14,896
Great. So we have a product view

436
00:19:14,896 --> 00:19:16,806
to add a way for

437
00:19:17,336 --> 00:19:20,076
I'm going to go to

438
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:23,036
in the bottom right corner and

439
00:19:23,536 --> 00:19:27,716
We provide you with this object

440
00:19:27,716 --> 00:19:28,716
to present the payment sheet.

441
00:19:29,826 --> 00:19:31,906
We just need to drag and

442
00:19:33,076 --> 00:19:34,426
And now let's add some code.

443
00:19:35,876 --> 00:19:37,796
I'm going to bring up

444
00:19:37,796 --> 00:19:40,156
so I can have the code

445
00:19:40,156 --> 00:19:44,746
I'm going to control drag from

446
00:19:45,406 --> 00:19:48,476
And create a new action

447
00:19:51,636 --> 00:19:57,906
Now let's just focus

448
00:19:58,066 --> 00:19:59,086
First of all, since we're going

449
00:19:59,086 --> 00:20:00,436
to be using the PassKit

450
00:19:59,086 --> 00:20:00,436
to be using the PassKit

451
00:20:00,436 --> 00:20:03,836
let's make sure we import that.

452
00:20:04,046 --> 00:20:06,246
And now we're going to implement

453
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:08,536
to be pretty similar to what

454
00:20:09,816 --> 00:20:12,036
First, we're going to

455
00:20:13,816 --> 00:20:17,266
In this case we're

456
00:20:17,346 --> 00:20:19,206
we're going to be charging

457
00:20:20,106 --> 00:20:21,956
We specify the merchant

458
00:20:21,956 --> 00:20:23,896
that we registered

459
00:20:24,786 --> 00:20:26,956
and the payment networks

460
00:20:27,256 --> 00:20:27,956
that we support.

461
00:20:29,046 --> 00:20:31,086
And finally a list

462
00:20:31,086 --> 00:20:36,226
in this case we're just using

463
00:20:36,386 --> 00:20:38,156
Now, if you want to

464
00:20:39,066 --> 00:20:41,636
we create a PK Payment

465
00:20:42,226 --> 00:20:44,566
We pass in the request,

466
00:20:44,566 --> 00:20:46,646
as a delegate, and

467
00:20:48,066 --> 00:20:50,136
Now for seed one we

468
00:20:50,136 --> 00:20:53,676
around Payment Controller while

469
00:20:54,236 --> 00:20:58,556
Let's define the state

470
00:21:00,046 --> 00:21:01,976
And then since we're

471
00:21:01,976 --> 00:21:05,546
protocol let's conform to that.

472
00:21:05,736 --> 00:21:07,286
And we only have

473
00:21:07,286 --> 00:21:09,176
of the required methods

474
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:15,166
The first one,

475
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:16,196
these authorize payment.

476
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:20,146
It's going to be called when

477
00:21:20,276 --> 00:21:22,296
And we provide you with all

478
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:24,926
to send to your payment

479
00:21:24,926 --> 00:21:27,526
and to confirm calling

480
00:21:27,526 --> 00:21:28,146
with a status.

481
00:21:29,576 --> 00:21:31,276
The second one, as

482
00:21:31,636 --> 00:21:33,406
PaymentAuthorizationController

483
00:21:33,796 --> 00:21:35,976
It's another opportunity for

484
00:21:36,126 --> 00:21:39,636
and perhaps present an

485
00:21:40,356 --> 00:21:41,626
This is all we have to do.

486
00:21:41,836 --> 00:21:43,736
So let's try bill and run this.

487
00:21:58,056 --> 00:21:59,636
Okay, there's our app.

488
00:21:59,636 --> 00:22:01,826
I'm just going to click the

489
00:21:59,636 --> 00:22:01,826
I'm just going to click the

490
00:22:02,456 --> 00:22:03,726
and there we have

491
00:22:04,366 --> 00:22:06,376
It's very simple, we have

492
00:22:06,376 --> 00:22:07,046
that we can try.

493
00:22:07,696 --> 00:22:08,946
And if you went to simulator,

494
00:22:08,946 --> 00:22:11,176
user action of double

495
00:22:11,566 --> 00:22:15,026
there's a new option on the

496
00:22:15,546 --> 00:22:18,286
and it's called Authorize

497
00:22:19,116 --> 00:22:21,406
We just click on

498
00:22:21,806 --> 00:22:24,816
Our payment is confirmed and

499
00:22:24,896 --> 00:22:26,036
pretty soon.

500
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:27,496
So that's our demo.

501
00:22:28,516 --> 00:22:33,976
[ Applause ]

502
00:22:34,476 --> 00:22:37,166
As you can see it's very

503
00:22:37,326 --> 00:22:39,396
It only took us just

504
00:22:39,396 --> 00:22:42,386
than 50 lines of code.

505
00:22:42,386 --> 00:22:44,116
Now, before we finish

506
00:22:44,276 --> 00:22:45,556
I want to talk about design.

507
00:22:46,466 --> 00:22:49,256
How do we make something easy

508
00:22:50,716 --> 00:22:54,006
Perhaps the most important thing

509
00:22:54,006 --> 00:22:55,696
of experience you want

510
00:22:56,626 --> 00:22:57,826
Users are not going

511
00:22:57,826 --> 00:22:59,786
than just a few seconds

512
00:23:01,066 --> 00:23:02,786
So try to offer them

513
00:23:02,966 --> 00:23:04,856
and direct them quickly

514
00:23:05,746 --> 00:23:08,566
Remember that the interactions

515
00:23:08,946 --> 00:23:12,866
Next, don't request

516
00:23:13,396 --> 00:23:15,506
This could be, for example,

517
00:23:16,496 --> 00:23:19,076
While we offer users the same

518
00:23:19,076 --> 00:23:21,996
for billing and shipping on

519
00:23:21,996 --> 00:23:24,906
to enter a new one right on the

520
00:23:25,436 --> 00:23:28,316
And then as we said in the demo,

521
00:23:28,446 --> 00:23:29,876
use the Payment Button

522
00:23:29,876 --> 00:23:32,036
If it's available on

523
00:23:32,266 --> 00:23:33,956
it is supported on

524
00:23:33,956 --> 00:23:35,116
so it is super easy to add.

525
00:23:35,736 --> 00:23:38,666
And please follow the guidelines

526
00:23:39,236 --> 00:23:41,426
This is probably more detail

527
00:23:41,426 --> 00:23:43,396
used in the context of your app.

528
00:23:44,966 --> 00:23:48,036
So to summarize, if

529
00:23:48,036 --> 00:23:51,016
that implements Apple Pay most

530
00:23:51,446 --> 00:23:52,496
You just need to make sure

531
00:23:52,496 --> 00:23:54,926
to implement PKPayment

532
00:23:55,306 --> 00:23:57,876
and use the present and dismiss

When you're designing

535
00:24:00,816 --> 00:24:02,436
remember that the

536
00:24:02,436 --> 00:24:03,596
and the screens are small.

537
00:24:04,836 --> 00:24:05,876
And use the Payment Button

538
00:24:05,876 --> 00:24:07,886
that we provide following

out last year's session

to create this kind

543
00:24:19,026 --> 00:24:21,246
and how to customize the

544
00:24:21,736 --> 00:24:24,756
I'm really excited to

with Apply Pay on the Watch.

547
00:24:28,386 --> 00:24:29,786
to tell you more

Thank you Leo.

551
00:24:38,996 --> 00:24:40,826
Okay. Extensions.

552
00:24:41,276 --> 00:24:46,986
In previous releases, Apple

553
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:48,316
that well with extensions.

554
00:24:48,646 --> 00:24:51,646
It's been difficult to

555
00:24:51,716 --> 00:24:53,786
probably because we've always

556
00:24:53,786 --> 00:24:57,206
to present from, and not

557
00:24:58,276 --> 00:24:59,756
Frankly, there also weren't

558
00:24:59,756 --> 00:25:01,696
that many interesting

that many interesting

There weren't that many

561
00:25:04,736 --> 00:25:08,456
and iOS 8 that really lend

562
00:25:09,206 --> 00:25:11,576
But that's changing in iOS 10.

563
00:25:12,386 --> 00:25:13,816
We've got some new

565
00:25:20,296 --> 00:25:22,526

567

to display in a non-UI context.

568
00:25:28,016 --> 00:25:30,506
The PKPayment

569
00:25:30,506 --> 00:25:34,376
that Leo showed you on watchOS,

570
00:25:34,746 --> 00:25:37,986
You can actually use it anywhere

571
00:25:38,266 --> 00:25:41,436
I want to show you some

572
00:25:41,876 --> 00:25:47,726
We gave the extension's API the

573
00:25:48,696 --> 00:25:53,166
and they use it to

574
00:25:53,416 --> 00:25:54,936
There's some other

575
00:25:54,936 --> 00:25:57,076
You can use it to split

576
00:25:57,786 --> 00:26:01,386
send gifts to friends,

577
00:25:57,786 --> 00:26:01,386
send gifts to friends,

578
00:26:01,736 --> 00:26:04,936
So here you can see,

579
00:26:05,156 --> 00:26:07,736
suggest with your friends,

580
00:26:07,896 --> 00:26:10,236
we never leave messages,

581
00:26:10,856 --> 00:26:11,486
And you're done.

582
00:26:12,306 --> 00:26:13,736
It's really easy.

583
00:26:14,596 --> 00:26:16,626
I want to show you

584
00:26:17,246 --> 00:26:21,206
It's Apple Pay in Siri and

585
00:26:21,686 --> 00:26:24,416
So there's a new ride

586
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:26,416
that works both in

587
00:26:26,796 --> 00:26:29,916
And you can use Apple Pay

588
00:26:29,916 --> 00:26:31,046
it's actually built in.

589
00:26:31,046 --> 00:26:34,026
So you can pay directly

590
00:26:34,526 --> 00:26:35,926
I'll show you a short

591
00:26:36,006 --> 00:26:38,046
The sample code that

592
00:26:38,146 --> 00:26:41,036
actually has a ride

593
00:26:42,036 --> 00:26:43,166
So here we're asking Siri

594
00:26:43,166 --> 00:26:44,866
to book a ride using

595
00:26:45,686 --> 00:26:49,426
Siri asks us if we want

596
00:26:50,856 --> 00:26:52,696
The Apple Pay sheet's

597
00:26:53,246 --> 00:26:56,876
I can touch ID, and

598
00:26:57,686 --> 00:26:58,496
It's that easy.

599
00:26:58,556 --> 00:27:00,586
I never have to leave

600
00:26:58,556 --> 00:27:00,586
I never have to leave

601
00:27:00,676 --> 00:27:01,826
never have to go to another app,

602
00:27:01,826 --> 00:27:03,526
never have to put any

603
00:27:03,996 --> 00:27:05,686
This is great if the user

604
00:27:05,686 --> 00:27:07,686
with your app, if they've

605
00:27:07,986 --> 00:27:09,316
they can still pay for things.

606
00:27:09,796 --> 00:27:13,606
They don't need to

607
00:27:13,606 --> 00:27:15,186
And so requesting and

608
00:27:15,186 --> 00:27:17,756
in these extension points

609
00:27:18,726 --> 00:27:19,586
There's no difference.

610
00:27:20,696 --> 00:27:23,476
You can use this new PKPayment

611
00:27:23,966 --> 00:27:26,806
in both your UI and

612
00:27:27,206 --> 00:27:29,426
And I actually recommend that

613
00:27:29,916 --> 00:27:31,756
You can have a centralized

614
00:27:31,966 --> 00:27:33,796
and you could share

615
00:27:33,936 --> 00:27:35,726
iOS app, and iOS extension.

616
00:27:36,286 --> 00:27:38,746
That's actually what we've

617
00:27:38,746 --> 00:27:41,636
So we've rewritten the Emporium

618
00:27:41,636 --> 00:27:43,416
year, it's been rewritten

619
00:27:44,196 --> 00:27:45,426
It's been simplified.

620
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:47,596
So it's a lot easier

621
00:27:48,206 --> 00:27:49,916
And it shows a shared

622
00:27:50,166 --> 00:27:52,536
where the actual payment

623
00:27:52,536 --> 00:27:53,936
regardless of the

624
00:27:55,116 --> 00:27:57,186
So, download that

625
00:27:58,026 --> 00:28:00,566
Of course, you might have a

626
00:27:58,026 --> 00:28:00,566
Of course, you might have a

627
00:28:00,566 --> 00:28:03,806
and that brings me on

628
00:28:04,226 --> 00:28:05,966
I saved the best

629
00:28:06,996 --> 00:28:08,176
Testing Apple Pay today

630
00:28:08,176 --> 00:28:09,786
if you've developed

631
00:28:10,016 --> 00:28:12,086
you'll notice it's

632
00:28:12,516 --> 00:28:13,766
You can test on the simulator.

633
00:28:13,766 --> 00:28:15,916
And we've actually got

634
00:28:15,916 --> 00:28:16,586
in the simulator.

635
00:28:16,586 --> 00:28:19,746
You saw the new authorized Apple

636
00:28:19,746 --> 00:28:23,286
for Watch, we're also bringing

637
00:28:23,786 --> 00:28:27,726
And you can test your iOS,

638
00:28:27,726 --> 00:28:30,446
on the web, you can test

639
00:28:30,446 --> 00:28:33,446
Now the simulator returns

640
00:28:33,446 --> 00:28:35,066
Its payment data

641
00:28:35,066 --> 00:28:36,916
It's not real and it's

642
00:28:37,826 --> 00:28:41,236
So it's really useful for UI

643
00:28:41,586 --> 00:28:44,636
But it's not particularly

644
00:28:45,846 --> 00:28:49,366
It's not real card data, and

645
00:28:49,366 --> 00:28:51,126
representative of

646
00:28:51,786 --> 00:28:54,766
You know we always tell you,

647
00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:57,486
of your sole way of developing,

648
00:28:57,736 --> 00:29:00,206
But with Apple Pay that's

649
00:28:57,736 --> 00:29:00,206
But with Apple Pay that's

650
00:29:00,306 --> 00:29:03,116
Apple Pay is available

651
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:04,176
but not all countries.

652
00:29:04,176 --> 00:29:06,746
Maybe your developers

653
00:29:06,746 --> 00:29:09,076
or you don't have a

654
00:29:09,166 --> 00:29:11,996
Okay, we're going

655
00:29:12,426 --> 00:29:15,596
We're going to introduce the

656
00:29:16,556 --> 00:29:18,616
The Sandbox is a brand

657
00:29:18,616 --> 00:29:22,946
for Apple Pay and it lets you

658
00:29:23,146 --> 00:29:25,746
onto real devices and the data

659
00:29:25,746 --> 00:29:29,456
that it returns is real payment

660
00:29:30,166 --> 00:29:33,376
So it's just like paying for

661
00:29:33,376 --> 00:29:34,516
or debit card in Apple Pay.

662
00:29:35,766 --> 00:29:38,616
It's really easy to use and

663
00:29:38,616 --> 00:29:40,966
And you can integrate it

664
00:29:40,966 --> 00:29:43,826
where previously perhaps you

665
00:29:43,826 --> 00:29:45,596
on production financial data.

666
00:29:46,836 --> 00:29:49,246
Getting set up with the Sandbox

667
00:29:49,726 --> 00:29:52,726
All you need to do is create

668
00:29:52,726 --> 00:29:53,696
at iTunes Connect.

669
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:56,306
Now you can already do this

670
00:29:56,376 --> 00:29:58,976
so this already exists today.

671
00:29:59,056 --> 00:30:01,646
You then just log into that

672
00:29:59,056 --> 00:30:01,646
You then just log into that

673
00:30:02,596 --> 00:30:03,586
If you're not in a region

674
00:30:03,586 --> 00:30:06,316
that supports Apple Pay you

675
00:30:06,316 --> 00:30:08,856
say the US, or to Canada.

676
00:30:09,036 --> 00:30:12,436
And then you just use the

677
00:30:12,436 --> 00:30:13,906
at developer.apple.com.

678
00:30:13,906 --> 00:30:15,946
We have a list of test

679
00:30:15,946 --> 00:30:17,326
There will be provisions

680
00:30:17,326 --> 00:30:19,336
to Apple Wallet just

681
00:30:21,176 --> 00:30:23,476
There's no developer

682
00:30:23,476 --> 00:30:25,386
Environment's a switch

683
00:30:26,376 --> 00:30:27,966
where you sign in

684
00:30:28,216 --> 00:30:31,216
Now you should still

685
00:30:31,216 --> 00:30:33,246
with production cards

686
00:30:33,246 --> 00:30:35,576
You still should do an

687
00:30:35,576 --> 00:30:38,436
I think this is going to be

688
00:30:38,436 --> 00:30:40,296
a really great feature

689
00:30:40,426 --> 00:30:42,606
And actually if you're

690
00:30:42,846 --> 00:30:44,466
which we talked about

691
00:30:44,686 --> 00:30:47,096
initially you're only able

692
00:30:47,096 --> 00:30:49,066
because we're not going to

693
00:30:49,376 --> 00:30:53,266
until later, nearer the

694
00:30:53,656 --> 00:30:57,986
So the Apple Pay Sandbox

695
00:30:57,986 --> 00:31:00,816
it supports American

696
00:30:57,986 --> 00:31:00,816
it supports American

697
00:31:01,106 --> 00:31:03,356
And more networks will be

698
00:31:03,926 --> 00:31:06,556
We're also hoping that the

699
00:31:06,556 --> 00:31:07,996
in various payment processes.

700
00:31:09,646 --> 00:31:10,706
So you can do that,

701
00:31:10,706 --> 00:31:12,456
it's available today

702
00:31:12,456 --> 00:31:16,086
So let's have a quick

703
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:17,476
of the stuff we talked

704
00:31:18,956 --> 00:31:21,676
We talked about some new Wallet

705
00:31:22,116 --> 00:31:23,516
Some of the new things

706
00:31:23,516 --> 00:31:27,606
over the past year and in iOS

707
00:31:27,856 --> 00:31:29,126
card issuers and retailers.

708
00:31:29,226 --> 00:31:31,106
And we talked about

709
00:31:32,046 --> 00:31:33,586
I think Apple Pay

710
00:31:33,586 --> 00:31:36,926
I can't wait to hail a ride

711
00:31:36,926 --> 00:31:38,346
without ever needing

712
00:31:39,236 --> 00:31:41,636
We also talked about

713
00:31:41,696 --> 00:31:43,346
I think there's so

714
00:31:43,686 --> 00:31:46,466
to enable really compelling

715
00:31:46,466 --> 00:31:49,486
for things without having to go

716
00:31:49,486 --> 00:31:51,616
straight from maps,

717
00:31:51,916 --> 00:31:54,236
And then we talked about testing

718
00:31:54,296 --> 00:31:56,036
in the Sandbox and

719
00:31:56,036 --> 00:32:00,036
There's one thing we didn't talk

720
00:31:56,036 --> 00:32:00,036
There's one thing we didn't talk

721
00:32:00,626 --> 00:32:01,636
that's Apple Pay on the Web.

722
00:32:03,056 --> 00:32:05,896
So, you can use Apple

723
00:32:05,896 --> 00:32:07,976
as well as in extensions,

724
00:32:07,976 --> 00:32:12,916
you can now use it on mobile

725
00:32:12,916 --> 00:32:14,816
on the desktop, on MacOS Sierra.

726
00:32:15,136 --> 00:32:16,456
You can authorize payment

727
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:19,156
in Safari using your

728
00:32:19,156 --> 00:32:21,026
both iPhone and Apple Watch.

729
00:32:22,466 --> 00:32:24,286
Now, we talked about this

730
00:32:24,286 --> 00:32:25,926
So if you're interested

731
00:32:25,926 --> 00:32:27,226
to the website, check

732
00:32:28,626 --> 00:32:30,586
And if you want more information

733
00:32:30,586 --> 00:32:33,356
about today you can check

734
00:32:35,526 --> 00:32:38,076
Now I did promise some

735
00:32:38,376 --> 00:32:39,196
and some other things.

736
00:32:39,196 --> 00:32:42,956
I promised you bank and co-brand

737
00:32:42,956 --> 00:32:45,676
If you're interested in taking

738
00:32:45,856 --> 00:32:48,936
or any of the features I

739
00:32:48,936 --> 00:32:50,776
and card issuers, you

740
00:32:50,896 --> 00:32:53,656
And if you're interested in

741
00:32:53,816 --> 00:32:55,016
you can visit our website,

742
00:32:55,406 --> 00:32:57,746
the links up here,

743

contact/passkit.

744
00:32:59,536 --> 00:33:01,516
And you can put in a request

745
00:32:59,536 --> 00:33:01,516
And you can put in a request

746
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:04,876
to use the value-added

747
00:33:05,346 --> 00:33:08,696
We have some related

748
00:33:08,696 --> 00:33:09,886
we just covered Apple

749
00:33:10,256 --> 00:33:14,266
There's also a WatchKit session

750
00:33:14,476 --> 00:33:16,616
Designing Great Apple

751
00:33:16,616 --> 00:33:18,686
I think you should

752
00:33:18,686 --> 00:33:20,456
if you're interested

753
00:33:20,456 --> 00:33:23,156
See how you can really enable

754
00:33:23,156 --> 00:33:24,966
with the new changes

755
00:33:25,506 --> 00:33:27,616
So thank you so much for coming.

756
00:33:28,326 --> 00:33:30,076
Thank you for making

757
00:33:30,076 --> 00:33:31,186
with your own applications.

758
00:33:31,566 --> 00:33:32,916
And I can't wait to see some

759
00:33:32,916 --> 00:33:34,536
of the amazing things

760
00:33:34,536 --> 00:33:36,816
And hopefully I'll see you

761
00:33:36,816 --> 00:33:38,396
about even more cool

762
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:39,966
Have a great WWDC.
