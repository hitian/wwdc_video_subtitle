3
00:00:29,056 --> 00:00:29,566
&gt;&gt; Hello everybody.

4
00:00:30,866 --> 00:00:33,436
Welcome back, if you came to

5
00:00:34,146 --> 00:00:34,836
My name is Nick.

6
00:00:35,576 --> 00:00:37,736
I'm here today with

7
00:00:38,076 --> 00:00:40,846
And we are going to talk

8
00:00:41,426 --> 00:00:43,496
Apple Pay on the web.

9
00:00:44,656 --> 00:00:47,246
But first, I want to

10
00:00:48,486 --> 00:00:51,906
How many of you, and put your

11
00:00:52,036 --> 00:00:54,136
if you are watching

12
00:00:54,276 --> 00:00:57,566
how many of you have tried to

13
00:00:57,566 --> 00:00:59,986
up because the checkout

14
00:01:00,486 --> 00:01:02,566
I'm seeing a lot of hands.

15
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:04,495
That's true isn't it?

16
00:01:04,495 --> 00:01:05,226
It's a big problem.

17
00:01:05,406 --> 00:01:08,016
Here's a site I went

18
00:01:08,146 --> 00:01:09,136
completely legitimate.

19
00:01:10,136 --> 00:01:12,146
Ignore the name, Honest

20
00:01:13,176 --> 00:01:15,156
But his checkout was

21
00:01:15,806 --> 00:01:18,646
And so I typed in my name, which

22
00:01:18,886 --> 00:01:20,706
to protect the innocent,

23
00:01:21,386 --> 00:01:22,626
And I typed in my

24
00:01:22,626 --> 00:01:24,146
And I got this confusing error.

25
00:01:24,146 --> 00:01:27,606
It said the card number needed

26
00:01:28,586 --> 00:01:30,606
So I thought, "Well,

27
00:01:30,606 --> 00:01:33,106
like the fact I had some spaces

28
00:01:33,106 --> 00:01:33,896
was written on my card.

29
00:01:34,686 --> 00:01:35,466
So I changed it.

30
00:01:36,556 --> 00:01:37,616
And then I got this other error.

31
00:01:37,616 --> 00:01:39,736
So apparently the

32
00:01:39,846 --> 00:01:41,966
which wasn't even the month

33
00:01:43,096 --> 00:01:44,686
This is very confusing.

34
00:01:45,426 --> 00:01:47,756
Now hopefully the checkouts

35
00:01:47,756 --> 00:01:48,546
as bad as this.

36
00:01:49,266 --> 00:01:51,936
But Internet checkouts,

37
00:01:52,756 --> 00:01:53,986
And we think we can solve that.

38
00:01:54,616 --> 00:01:56,666
We think we can solve

39
00:01:56,666 --> 00:01:59,286
And we are going to talk today

40
00:01:59,736 --> 00:02:02,256
about how we can solve

41
00:01:59,736 --> 00:02:02,256
about how we can solve

42
00:02:02,256 --> 00:02:05,546
on the web using

43
00:02:05,746 --> 00:02:07,176
and the great benefits

44
00:02:07,176 --> 00:02:09,705
We have got a lot to

45
00:02:09,705 --> 00:02:11,026
to start off with

46
00:02:11,026 --> 00:02:14,156
We are going to run through some

47
00:02:14,156 --> 00:02:16,986
if you are not familiar with

48
00:02:16,986 --> 00:02:19,606
Then we are going to talk

49
00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:22,626
the new API that we've added

50
00:02:22,626 --> 00:02:25,506
And then we'll move on

51
00:02:25,506 --> 00:02:27,216
how you can actually get paid.

52
00:02:28,626 --> 00:02:30,536
And finally we'll look at

53
00:02:30,726 --> 00:02:33,806
how to make your sites

54
00:02:33,806 --> 00:02:36,106
and have a great

55
00:02:36,516 --> 00:02:38,606
So let's get started.

56
00:02:40,316 --> 00:02:41,506
What is Apple Pay?

57
00:02:42,536 --> 00:02:45,016
Hopefully most of you are

58
00:02:45,516 --> 00:02:49,346
It's an easy, secure,

59
00:02:50,516 --> 00:02:54,186
And you can pay both

60
00:02:54,356 --> 00:02:56,366
within iOS applications.

61
00:02:57,596 --> 00:02:58,476
Maybe you've tried that.

62
00:02:58,576 --> 00:02:59,686
If you haven't, give it a go.

63
00:02:59,686 --> 00:03:02,966
There are some great apps

64
00:02:59,686 --> 00:03:02,966
There are some great apps

65
00:03:02,966 --> 00:03:04,886
that you can use while you

66
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:09,636
And Apple Pay within apps

67
00:03:09,636 --> 00:03:11,006
eCommerce experiences.

68
00:03:11,366 --> 00:03:13,166
They are apps that really shine.

69
00:03:14,466 --> 00:03:19,136
And thousands of applications

70
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:23,896
across the world, in China,

71
00:03:25,156 --> 00:03:28,006
And these apps are

72
00:03:28,176 --> 00:03:31,296
They are seeing higher

73
00:03:31,716 --> 00:03:33,656
Users who pay with Apple

74
00:03:33,656 --> 00:03:35,306
to convert to paying customers.

75
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:38,696
And they are also seeing

76
00:03:39,296 --> 00:03:40,876
These users aren't

77
00:03:40,876 --> 00:03:43,776
they are spending more

78
00:03:44,016 --> 00:03:46,146
And finally, users are happier.

79
00:03:47,156 --> 00:03:50,266
Apple Pay has one of the highest

80
00:03:50,476 --> 00:03:52,046
of any payment method ever.

81
00:03:52,946 --> 00:03:54,986
It's so easy to use,

82
00:03:55,096 --> 00:03:58,676
And that's great

83
00:03:59,366 --> 00:04:00,876
But I think there is

84
00:03:59,366 --> 00:04:00,876
But I think there is

85
00:04:02,026 --> 00:04:06,416
A large amount of

86
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:07,476
of the app ecosystem.

87
00:04:08,336 --> 00:04:09,006
Apps are great.

88
00:04:09,326 --> 00:04:10,016
I love apps.

89
00:04:10,346 --> 00:04:13,396
But many of us still pay

90
00:04:14,566 --> 00:04:17,406
Most payment on the

91
00:04:17,406 --> 00:04:18,266
It's laborious.

92
00:04:18,266 --> 00:04:19,086
And it's unclear.

93
00:04:19,086 --> 00:04:20,606
The checkout flow is different

94
00:04:20,606 --> 00:04:22,866
for every single

95
00:04:22,936 --> 00:04:23,506
It's different.

96
00:04:23,626 --> 00:04:26,856
And so we are going

97
00:04:26,896 --> 00:04:28,806
And we are going to solve

98
00:04:28,806 --> 00:04:32,116
to more places and

99
00:04:32,656 --> 00:04:35,636
And we call that

100
00:04:36,056 --> 00:04:38,186
because there's three main

101
00:04:39,556 --> 00:04:40,666
One of them is WatchKit.

102
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:42,916
You may have seen this

103
00:04:43,126 --> 00:04:45,116
and Kevin talked about how

104
00:04:45,116 --> 00:04:46,066
to WatchKit apps.

105
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:49,676
And we are also bringing it to

106
00:04:49,676 --> 00:04:53,296
that you saw: SiriKit,

107
00:04:54,106 --> 00:04:56,386
But perhaps the biggest

108
00:04:56,386 --> 00:05:00,806
and the reason you are here

109
00:04:56,386 --> 00:05:00,806
and the reason you are here

110
00:05:01,486 --> 00:05:04,816
We are going to talk about

111
00:05:04,816 --> 00:05:06,246
in the session right after this.

112
00:05:06,346 --> 00:05:08,396
So if you like the sound of

113
00:05:09,426 --> 00:05:13,366
But for now let's focus

114
00:05:13,366 --> 00:05:15,326
on Apple Pay on the web.

115
00:05:15,396 --> 00:05:17,786
I have already talked to you

116
00:05:17,786 --> 00:05:20,946
about how eCommerce

117
00:05:22,476 --> 00:05:24,396
Large amounts of retail

118
00:05:24,996 --> 00:05:27,876
But these checkouts are

119
00:05:27,876 --> 00:05:29,166
and they are hard to use.

120
00:05:29,286 --> 00:05:31,796
And that's doubly

121
00:05:32,316 --> 00:05:34,766
The screens are smaller, but

122
00:05:34,766 --> 00:05:35,576
as complicated.

123
00:05:37,046 --> 00:05:39,686
Users also want the same

124
00:05:39,686 --> 00:05:41,376
from apps, the same ease of use,

125
00:05:41,376 --> 00:05:43,586
the same security,

126
00:05:43,586 --> 00:05:45,516
How many of you have

127
00:05:45,516 --> 00:05:47,406
because you got an

128
00:05:47,406 --> 00:05:50,056
that some site you shopped at

129
00:05:50,786 --> 00:05:51,566
I know I have.

130
00:05:52,766 --> 00:05:54,946
And so Apple Pay solves that.

131
00:05:55,906 --> 00:05:57,776
And Apple Pay on

132
00:05:57,776 --> 00:06:00,306
on any Apple Pay device today.

133
00:05:57,776 --> 00:06:00,306
on any Apple Pay device today.

134
00:06:01,176 --> 00:06:03,326
That's iPhone and iPad.

135
00:06:03,966 --> 00:06:08,836
And it's available on Safari

136
00:06:09,256 --> 00:06:13,226
It's the same Apple Pay

137
00:06:13,316 --> 00:06:16,456
the exact UI, the

138
00:06:16,456 --> 00:06:18,326
If you are familiar

139
00:06:18,496 --> 00:06:19,406
you'll be right at home.

140
00:06:20,406 --> 00:06:22,846
But there is something

141
00:06:22,846 --> 00:06:26,116
and that's on the desktop.

142
00:06:27,326 --> 00:06:28,736
Now in some countries

143
00:06:28,806 --> 00:06:31,596
mobile eCommerce is the

144
00:06:31,596 --> 00:06:34,816
But here in the U.S., the

145
00:06:34,816 --> 00:06:36,016
for things on their desktop.

146
00:06:36,356 --> 00:06:39,486
You have probably bought

147
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:43,436
And we think Apple Pay should

148
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:49,156
And so we are also bringing

149
00:06:50,386 --> 00:06:53,246
Now you can pay directly

150
00:06:53,306 --> 00:06:55,916
but with the same security

151
00:06:56,296 --> 00:06:59,106
on your iPhone and

152
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:02,986
You can simply tap through

153
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:02,986
You can simply tap through

154
00:07:03,586 --> 00:07:06,526
It's really easy to use, and

155
00:07:06,876 --> 00:07:09,446
It's available on any

156
00:07:09,756 --> 00:07:11,076
that can run Mac OS Sierra.

157
00:07:11,366 --> 00:07:14,706
So that's pretty much every Mac

158
00:07:15,346 --> 00:07:17,106
It's fully supported in Safari.

159
00:07:17,816 --> 00:07:20,196
And you authorize the

160
00:07:20,636 --> 00:07:21,596
or on your Apple Watch.

161
00:07:22,556 --> 00:07:26,336
Now because Apple Pay

162
00:07:26,726 --> 00:07:29,196
you might have missed the

163
00:07:29,196 --> 00:07:30,486
So I am going to

164
00:07:31,026 --> 00:07:31,456
Don't worry.

165
00:07:31,866 --> 00:07:32,486
It's very quick.

166
00:07:33,516 --> 00:07:34,456
Let me switch over here.

167
00:07:34,616 --> 00:07:42,546
So I have got, on

168
00:07:42,546 --> 00:07:43,846
and on the right

169
00:07:43,956 --> 00:07:47,576
Now Craig booked a few

170
00:07:47,576 --> 00:07:48,876
"Finding Dory" on Thursday.

171
00:07:48,996 --> 00:07:51,156
I am going to crash

172
00:07:51,226 --> 00:07:52,246
I am going to crash that.

173
00:07:52,246 --> 00:07:53,186
We are going to join him.

174
00:07:53,186 --> 00:07:56,516
I am going to take 10 of my

175
00:07:57,416 --> 00:07:58,936
Yeah, we'll go say hi to Craig.

176
00:07:59,926 --> 00:08:02,036
OK. I clicked the buy

177
00:07:59,926 --> 00:08:02,036
OK. I clicked the buy

178
00:08:02,196 --> 00:08:04,356
and that's what happened

179
00:08:04,836 --> 00:08:05,746
Let's do that again.

180
00:08:05,746 --> 00:08:06,696
I'm going to cancel it.

181
00:08:06,696 --> 00:08:08,516
And you'll see when I

182
00:08:08,516 --> 00:08:09,666
from the phone as well.

183
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:12,006
So I' m going to tap

184
00:08:12,626 --> 00:08:14,776
It's immediate.

185
00:08:15,156 --> 00:08:16,186
It came up straightaway.

186
00:08:16,186 --> 00:08:17,976
And then I just Touch

187
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:23,916
And we're done.

188
00:08:24,366 --> 00:08:25,446
We paid in seconds.

189
00:08:25,796 --> 00:08:27,786
It was instant between

190
00:08:27,786 --> 00:08:30,356
And I get a notification telling

191
00:08:30,886 --> 00:08:35,106
That's how easy and quick

192
00:08:35,436 --> 00:08:38,506
It's blindingly fast.

193
00:08:40,256 --> 00:08:43,086
So hopefully I have sold you

194
00:08:43,676 --> 00:08:46,936
Let's talk a bit about

195
00:08:47,716 --> 00:08:50,056
Now before we dive into the

196
00:08:50,056 --> 00:08:51,646
over a few basics of Apple Pay

197
00:08:51,646 --> 00:08:53,886
because perhaps you

198
00:08:53,886 --> 00:08:54,796
into your application.

199
00:08:54,796 --> 00:08:56,616
Perhaps you are solely

200
00:08:57,116 --> 00:09:01,806
So Apple Pay provides you

201
00:08:57,116 --> 00:09:01,806
So Apple Pay provides you

202
00:09:03,346 --> 00:09:06,966
And you send this token to your

203
00:09:06,966 --> 00:09:09,046
or Braintree, or

204
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:13,186
Now this token is unique

205
00:09:13,186 --> 00:09:14,786
It can only be used one time,

206
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:16,286
and for the amount

207
00:09:17,096 --> 00:09:20,296
But when you use Apple Pay

208
00:09:20,386 --> 00:09:22,846
it's also unique to

209
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:23,896
It's encrypted.

210
00:09:24,586 --> 00:09:27,096
So even if the token

211
00:09:27,096 --> 00:09:28,516
if the connection the user is

212
00:09:28,516 --> 00:09:31,116
on was an unsecured

213
00:09:31,526 --> 00:09:33,276
the token is still

214
00:09:33,316 --> 00:09:35,816
because it's encrypted

215
00:09:36,116 --> 00:09:37,896
and a merchant identifier.

216
00:09:38,396 --> 00:09:41,476
Now the merchant identifier

217
00:09:41,476 --> 00:09:44,536
and certificate identify

218
00:09:45,486 --> 00:09:48,256
They look like this, like

219
00:09:48,256 --> 00:09:49,616
If you are an iOS developer,

220
00:09:49,616 --> 00:09:51,026
you'll be familiar

221
00:09:51,336 --> 00:09:54,346
And they're generated

222
00:09:55,036 --> 00:09:56,336
And because they

223
00:09:56,336 --> 00:09:59,246
and because only you can

224
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:02,696
only you can read your

225
00:10:04,576 --> 00:10:05,996
Now let's see how

226
00:10:05,996 --> 00:10:08,656
in an actual application today.

227
00:10:08,656 --> 00:10:12,956
So in an iOS app, Apple

228
00:10:12,956 --> 00:10:13,746
with Apple Pay button.

229
00:10:14,346 --> 00:10:18,076
Now when the Buy with Apple

230
00:10:19,116 --> 00:10:21,376
iOS authorizes the payment.

231
00:10:21,516 --> 00:10:23,356
It displays the Apple Pay sheet.

232
00:10:24,216 --> 00:10:27,056
And the user Touch IDs

233
00:10:27,576 --> 00:10:31,386
And so payment data is generated

234
00:10:31,646 --> 00:10:34,076
on the phone; that's the

235
00:10:34,076 --> 00:10:37,016
that securely holds

236
00:10:37,196 --> 00:10:40,196
Now what happens next

237
00:10:40,196 --> 00:10:43,916
in an app is this data is sent

238
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:45,526
through a process

239
00:10:45,526 --> 00:10:49,016
And that's when it's reencrypted

240
00:10:49,656 --> 00:10:51,016
This happens behind the scenes.

241
00:10:52,386 --> 00:10:54,106
And so when your

242
00:10:54,406 --> 00:10:56,296
it just receives

243
00:10:56,296 --> 00:10:59,726
rewrapped payment data

244
00:11:00,716 --> 00:11:04,116
to your merchant or your

245
00:11:04,116 --> 00:11:07,016
and then just dismiss the sheet

246
00:11:07,596 --> 00:11:11,506
Now the flow is very

247
00:11:11,936 --> 00:11:13,326
There's a couple of differences

248
00:11:13,546 --> 00:11:16,536
around how we actually validate

249
00:11:16,536 --> 00:11:18,536
when you have an app, it's

250
00:11:18,686 --> 00:11:19,816
It's a signed binary.

251
00:11:20,586 --> 00:11:22,346
Before we go into

252
00:11:22,346 --> 00:11:24,656
through a few requirements

253
00:11:25,996 --> 00:11:28,046
Apple Pay on the

254
00:11:28,046 --> 00:11:29,746
to any website that

255
00:11:30,596 --> 00:11:33,036
But you have to have an

256
00:11:33,556 --> 00:11:39,416
and your site has to

257
00:11:39,576 --> 00:11:42,896
Finally, your site has to comply

258
00:11:43,066 --> 00:11:44,906
Now these are very

259
00:11:44,906 --> 00:11:47,586
Most payment processors have

260
00:11:47,586 --> 00:11:49,116
of goods you can

261
00:11:49,686 --> 00:11:55,256
Now some eCommerce platforms

262
00:11:55,626 --> 00:11:57,446
on your behalf.

263
00:11:57,756 --> 00:11:59,546
We'll talk about the exact

264
00:11:59,546 --> 00:12:02,806
partnering with in the next

265
00:11:59,546 --> 00:12:02,806
partnering with in the next

266
00:12:02,926 --> 00:12:04,936
But if you are partnered with

267
00:12:04,936 --> 00:12:06,566
you won't actually need to

268
00:12:06,596 --> 00:12:07,786
it can be taken care of for you.

269
00:12:09,776 --> 00:12:12,336
So assuming your site

270
00:12:12,336 --> 00:12:16,726
of these requirements, the

271
00:12:16,726 --> 00:12:19,706
to register your site.

272
00:12:19,966 --> 00:12:21,816
Registering your

273
00:12:21,936 --> 00:12:24,426
You just create a merchant

274
00:12:24,426 --> 00:12:25,556
at the developer portal.

275
00:12:26,086 --> 00:12:29,726
And then you register

276
00:12:29,986 --> 00:12:31,416
to this merchant identifier.

277
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:34,776
This is the fully qualified

278
00:12:34,776 --> 00:12:39,236
store.apple.com, that you want

279
00:12:40,366 --> 00:12:41,776
Now when you register

280
00:12:41,906 --> 00:12:43,096
we'll go off and validate it.

281
00:12:44,726 --> 00:12:46,706
And you'll also obtain

282
00:12:46,846 --> 00:12:48,886
a TLS certificate that we issue.

283
00:12:49,096 --> 00:12:50,776
And we call this the

284
00:12:50,966 --> 00:12:52,126
So I just want to recap.

285
00:12:52,126 --> 00:12:53,956
We have got three

286
00:12:53,956 --> 00:12:55,486
from registering for Apple Pay.

287
00:12:55,486 --> 00:12:57,186
We have got our merchant

288
00:12:57,396 --> 00:12:58,556
and our merchant certificate.

289
00:12:58,876 --> 00:13:00,306
They identify us as a merchant.

290
00:12:58,876 --> 00:13:00,306
They identify us as a merchant.

291
00:13:00,486 --> 00:13:03,196
And then we have the Apple

292
00:13:03,196 --> 00:13:04,576
which identifies our domain.

293
00:13:04,766 --> 00:13:06,956
And when you register

294
00:13:06,956 --> 00:13:08,496
it's very easy, very

295
00:13:08,726 --> 00:13:09,936
It should be enabled right now.

296
00:13:10,186 --> 00:13:11,266
It looks something like this.

297
00:13:11,926 --> 00:13:12,896
And just add a domain.

298
00:13:13,506 --> 00:13:15,896
We validate it by checking

299
00:13:15,896 --> 00:13:17,816
that we ask you to

300
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:20,206
And you're done.

301
00:13:21,786 --> 00:13:24,176
So let's look at how

302
00:13:24,176 --> 00:13:28,566
Let's look at the Apple

303
00:13:29,226 --> 00:13:33,326
Now just like Apple Pay within

304
00:13:33,426 --> 00:13:36,316
when you press or tap the

305
00:13:36,796 --> 00:13:39,546
Now there's a key

306
00:13:40,266 --> 00:13:43,606
You create the payment

307
00:13:43,606 --> 00:13:45,516
that tells us what

308
00:13:46,866 --> 00:13:48,576
And then something

309
00:13:48,856 --> 00:13:50,156
This is a piece of validation.

310
00:13:50,256 --> 00:13:52,106
You create a merchant session.

311
00:13:52,506 --> 00:13:55,686
And this is requested from

312
00:13:57,136 --> 00:13:59,856
It's returned back to

313
00:13:59,856 --> 00:14:01,446
on with your payment request.

314
00:13:59,856 --> 00:14:01,446
on with your payment request.

315
00:14:01,926 --> 00:14:05,626
That's the only difference.

316
00:14:05,726 --> 00:14:07,676
That's the only difference

317
00:14:07,676 --> 00:14:10,396
within an app and

318
00:14:10,736 --> 00:14:12,326
this merchant validation piece.

319
00:14:12,826 --> 00:14:16,126
Let's focus a little more

320
00:14:16,126 --> 00:14:21,086
Let's talk about why we do it.

321
00:14:22,056 --> 00:14:24,976
So I mentioned just a moment ago

322
00:14:24,976 --> 00:14:27,636
that the web is a

323
00:14:28,026 --> 00:14:32,076
In an iOS app, security of

324
00:14:32,076 --> 00:14:35,216
or Location is protected

325
00:14:35,216 --> 00:14:37,216
If you are not familiar

326
00:14:37,216 --> 00:14:39,006
of information that

327
00:14:39,006 --> 00:14:40,396
into your binary

328
00:14:40,816 --> 00:14:44,976
And this protects both

329
00:14:44,976 --> 00:14:46,906
in the case of Apple

330
00:14:47,426 --> 00:14:49,436
Now obviously on the web

331
00:14:49,436 --> 00:14:51,126
and we don't have

332
00:14:51,306 --> 00:14:53,756
So instead we have this

333
00:14:54,736 --> 00:14:58,226
It protects both your users, and

334
00:14:58,406 --> 00:15:00,746
If your site is compromised, for

335
00:14:58,406 --> 00:15:00,746
If your site is compromised, for

336
00:15:00,746 --> 00:15:02,566
to stop Apple Pay

337
00:15:03,056 --> 00:15:05,746
Merchant validation

338
00:15:05,746 --> 00:15:06,676
and really straightforward.

339
00:15:06,676 --> 00:15:07,816
It's not that tricky.

340
00:15:08,426 --> 00:15:10,776
You take an Apple

341
00:15:11,556 --> 00:15:13,946
and this URL is provided

342
00:15:14,486 --> 00:15:18,246
You send this URL

343
00:15:19,556 --> 00:15:21,266
which then requests

344
00:15:22,846 --> 00:15:25,686
Now to request the merchant

345
00:15:25,686 --> 00:15:28,236
TLS certificate that we

346
00:15:28,486 --> 00:15:29,756
It's a challenge response.

347
00:15:30,886 --> 00:15:33,136
And if that certificate

348
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:35,126
if it matches the domain

349
00:15:35,606 --> 00:15:37,296
that you are requesting

350
00:15:37,636 --> 00:15:38,766
we'll return a session.

351
00:15:41,306 --> 00:15:43,686
Now this session is opaque.

352
00:15:43,686 --> 00:15:45,346
You don't need to worry

353
00:15:45,606 --> 00:15:47,736
It's basically a unique

354
00:15:47,736 --> 00:15:49,196
with a single Apple Pay request.

355
00:15:49,656 --> 00:15:52,486
And it's used to ensure that

356
00:15:52,856 --> 00:15:56,056
You have to request this

357
00:15:56,376 --> 00:15:58,336
but it's a very lightweight

358
00:15:58,336 --> 00:15:59,796
it doesn't take very

359
00:16:00,946 --> 00:16:02,776
And you request it

360
00:16:03,096 --> 00:16:05,146
You don't request

361
00:16:05,236 --> 00:16:09,956
I have got some tips for

362
00:16:10,536 --> 00:16:13,506
The first one is to always

363
00:16:13,506 --> 00:16:16,126
from the client, because

364
00:16:16,126 --> 00:16:17,306
on the country the user is in.

365
00:16:17,346 --> 00:16:19,276
Apple Pay has many

366
00:16:19,496 --> 00:16:21,446
and we'll use the one

367
00:16:21,446 --> 00:16:23,216
in the region they

368
00:16:23,646 --> 00:16:25,986
Now for some of you,

369
00:16:25,986 --> 00:16:29,556
up front the IP addresses

370
00:16:29,556 --> 00:16:31,176
through your firewalls

371
00:16:31,176 --> 00:16:32,306
And we'll provide a list

372
00:16:32,546 --> 00:16:35,166
on developmentalapple.com

373
00:16:36,676 --> 00:16:39,136
You should also only request a

374
00:16:39,136 --> 00:16:40,036
with the Apple Pay button.

375
00:16:40,126 --> 00:16:42,126
Don't request it on every

376
00:16:42,306 --> 00:16:44,356
You only need to request it

377
00:16:44,646 --> 00:16:46,876
We actually display the

378
00:16:46,876 --> 00:16:47,876
requesting the session.

379
00:16:48,386 --> 00:16:50,596
So from a user's perspective

380
00:16:50,846 --> 00:16:52,616
They tap or click

381
00:16:52,616 --> 00:16:55,146
They'll see the sheet, and we'll

382
00:16:55,146 --> 00:16:56,716
until this validation

383
00:16:57,236 --> 00:16:59,376
You'll see how that works in

384
00:16:59,376 --> 00:17:01,336
about the JavaScript API.

385
00:16:59,376 --> 00:17:01,336
about the JavaScript API.

386
00:17:02,016 --> 00:17:05,046
Finally, don't generate a

387
00:17:05,786 --> 00:17:08,576
That's because you have to

388
00:17:08,636 --> 00:17:10,546
this certificate is

389
00:17:10,546 --> 00:17:12,776
You don't want to embed that on

390
00:17:12,776 --> 00:17:14,675
It's very important

391
00:17:15,695 --> 00:17:19,746
And so you perform the

392
00:17:19,925 --> 00:17:21,516
OK, let's recap.

393
00:17:22,016 --> 00:17:23,576
We have got ourself set up.

394
00:17:23,576 --> 00:17:25,195
We made sure that

395
00:17:25,896 --> 00:17:26,866
with Apple's requirements.

396
00:17:27,736 --> 00:17:29,386
And we created our

397
00:17:29,476 --> 00:17:30,576
and our merchant certificate,

398
00:17:30,576 --> 00:17:32,556
and we linked it

399
00:17:33,096 --> 00:17:36,556
And then we learned

400
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:39,926
how to validate our site

401
00:17:40,406 --> 00:17:44,916
So that covers this

402
00:17:45,706 --> 00:17:47,826
What about this portion?

403
00:17:49,246 --> 00:17:53,996
I said it was the same

404
00:17:55,036 --> 00:17:56,696
But it's obviously

405
00:17:56,836 --> 00:17:59,686
because sadly we can't

406
00:18:00,676 --> 00:18:02,076
And so we are going to talk now

407
00:18:02,076 --> 00:18:05,236
about the new JavaScript API

408
00:18:05,696 --> 00:18:07,496
And to do that, I'd

409
00:18:07,576 --> 00:18:09,436
from the WebKit Team

410
00:18:09,706 --> 00:18:09,976
Anders.

411
00:18:10,516 --> 00:18:16,500
[ Applause ]

412
00:18:19,426 --> 00:18:20,366
&gt;&gt; Thanks Nick.

413
00:18:21,826 --> 00:18:24,006
I am really excited

414
00:18:24,006 --> 00:18:25,656
and show you how easy it is

415
00:18:25,656 --> 00:18:29,236
to use the Apple

416
00:18:30,966 --> 00:18:35,576
As Nick mentioned, the Apple

417
00:18:35,576 --> 00:18:39,886
in iOS 10 in Safari,

418
00:18:39,886 --> 00:18:41,306
that use SafariViewController.

419
00:18:42,116 --> 00:18:47,456
And now, with Mac OS Sierra, you

420
00:18:48,196 --> 00:18:51,936
in Safari, using your

421
00:18:51,936 --> 00:18:53,546
to do the actual authorization.

422
00:18:54,096 --> 00:18:57,816
It's a relatively simple API.

423
00:18:57,916 --> 00:19:01,026
It's got a single entry

424
00:18:57,916 --> 00:19:01,026
It's got a single entry

425
00:19:01,546 --> 00:19:04,066
And it's influenced

426
00:19:04,066 --> 00:19:06,166
for doing Apple Pay with an app.

427
00:19:06,696 --> 00:19:09,136
So if you are familiar

428
00:19:09,136 --> 00:19:10,866
you'll notice a lot

429
00:19:13,106 --> 00:19:16,956
Now before we dive

430
00:19:16,956 --> 00:19:18,386
about this friend of mine.

431
00:19:19,706 --> 00:19:25,746
She owns a store that sells

432
00:19:27,016 --> 00:19:27,896
for dogs.

433
00:19:29,676 --> 00:19:33,466
And a couple of months

434
00:19:33,466 --> 00:19:35,116
where you can buy these clothes.

435
00:19:35,116 --> 00:19:37,676
You can order them

436
00:19:37,706 --> 00:19:39,186
and have them shipped

437
00:19:40,426 --> 00:19:45,076
But unfortunately business

438
00:19:47,996 --> 00:19:52,616
She's getting a lot of traffic

439
00:19:52,616 --> 00:19:54,526
of actual orders go through.

440
00:19:55,016 --> 00:19:57,456
So let's take a look

441
00:19:57,456 --> 00:19:58,716
if we can figure out why.

442
00:20:02,236 --> 00:20:03,916
So this is our website.

443
00:20:04,266 --> 00:20:07,996
And let's say I want to

444
00:20:09,156 --> 00:20:13,436
Well first I have to

445
00:20:15,696 --> 00:20:17,076
Then I have to check out.

446
00:20:18,956 --> 00:20:20,906
Then I'm at the Checkout page,

447
00:20:20,906 --> 00:20:23,306
and I have to enter

448
00:20:23,796 --> 00:20:27,446
And then I have to go

449
00:20:27,446 --> 00:20:30,386
and enter the credit card

450
00:20:31,836 --> 00:20:37,096
And then I can place my order,

451
00:20:38,496 --> 00:20:41,516
So let's see how we can

452
00:20:41,676 --> 00:20:45,156
to make this process

453
00:20:46,306 --> 00:20:50,296
For example, what if we could

454
00:20:50,466 --> 00:20:54,586
and supplement it with

455
00:20:54,806 --> 00:20:59,926
so that you can place orders

456
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:03,606
Now we only want to display

457
00:21:03,606 --> 00:21:06,056
that the user can actually

458
00:21:06,526 --> 00:21:08,606
So in order to do that,

459
00:21:08,716 --> 00:21:12,596
we can use the function

460
00:21:13,516 --> 00:21:15,386
This is a pretty

461
00:21:15,576 --> 00:21:17,136
This is how it would

462
00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:21,026
Note here that I am

463
00:21:21,026 --> 00:21:25,146
of the window.ApplePaySession

464
00:21:25,146 --> 00:21:26,796
So I am not checking

465
00:21:26,796 --> 00:21:30,106
for a specific version

466
00:21:30,106 --> 00:21:32,566
I am just checking for the

467
00:21:33,466 --> 00:21:35,316
And if it exists, I call it --

468
00:21:35,316 --> 00:21:38,356
it returns a boolean and

469
00:21:38,776 --> 00:21:42,396
If it returns true, I call this

470
00:21:43,066 --> 00:21:44,206
And that will show the button.

471
00:21:45,396 --> 00:21:47,706
It's important to note, though,

472
00:21:47,706 --> 00:21:50,986
that this function only tells

473
00:21:50,986 --> 00:21:52,466
supported by the device.

474
00:21:53,026 --> 00:21:55,856
So if you are on an

475
00:21:56,076 --> 00:21:58,276
it'll tell you whether

476
00:21:58,866 --> 00:22:00,206
And if you are on a Mac,

477
00:21:58,866 --> 00:22:00,206
And if you are on a Mac,

478
00:22:00,356 --> 00:22:03,666
it'll tell you whether there

479
00:22:04,026 --> 00:22:05,436
that can authorize the payment.

480
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:09,746
It does not tell you whether

481
00:22:10,476 --> 00:22:12,126
So in order to check for that,

482
00:22:12,696 --> 00:22:16,486
we can use the function

483
00:22:16,486 --> 00:22:17,446
WithActiveCard.

484
00:22:19,016 --> 00:22:22,536
You pass this function,

485
00:22:23,096 --> 00:22:27,826
And it actually goes out to the

486
00:22:27,856 --> 00:22:30,146
that the merchant

487
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:33,816
and that it's properly

488
00:22:33,816 --> 00:22:35,206
where you are making

489
00:22:36,496 --> 00:22:38,436
Because of this,

490
00:22:38,466 --> 00:22:40,616
and returns a JavaScript

491
00:22:41,666 --> 00:22:44,566
Now if you don't know what

492
00:22:44,566 --> 00:22:47,276
you can just think of

493
00:22:47,276 --> 00:22:49,906
of doing callback-based

494
00:22:51,016 --> 00:22:54,696
There are also some

495
00:22:54,696 --> 00:22:56,176
when you can use this function.

496
00:22:56,276 --> 00:22:58,186
You can use it if

497
00:22:58,186 --> 00:23:01,756
to Apple Pay during your

498
00:22:58,186 --> 00:23:01,756
to Apple Pay during your

499
00:23:01,826 --> 00:23:04,346
to add an Apple Pay button

500
00:23:04,736 --> 00:23:07,296
Now in our case we want

501
00:23:07,296 --> 00:23:10,056
to our main product page,

502
00:23:10,366 --> 00:23:13,816
Otherwise we would have used

503
00:23:14,766 --> 00:23:17,506
But here is how we

504
00:23:18,146 --> 00:23:20,096
Again, I am checking

505
00:23:20,136 --> 00:23:21,706
of the Apple Pay session object.

506
00:23:22,816 --> 00:23:25,446
Then I call canMakePayments

507
00:23:25,786 --> 00:23:27,646
I tap in my merchant identifier.

508
00:23:28,246 --> 00:23:32,406
And then I use this

509
00:23:32,546 --> 00:23:35,536
when the promise is resolved,

510
00:23:35,536 --> 00:23:37,176
to a boolean that's

511
00:23:37,746 --> 00:23:40,616
the function I specified

512
00:23:40,926 --> 00:23:44,466
And if canMakePayments is true,

513
00:23:44,466 --> 00:23:49,216
So now we've got our

514
00:23:49,216 --> 00:23:51,216
for every single

515
00:23:51,726 --> 00:23:54,296
And the next step is to

516
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:56,116
when the user clicks

517
00:23:56,686 --> 00:23:59,266
So in order to do that,

518
00:23:59,696 --> 00:24:01,686
we'll create a new

519
00:23:59,696 --> 00:24:01,686
we'll create a new

520
00:24:01,686 --> 00:24:02,796
JavaScript object.

521
00:24:03,206 --> 00:24:07,286
The ApplePaySession constructor

522
00:24:07,746 --> 00:24:10,296
One is an API version number.

523
00:24:10,996 --> 00:24:12,386
This is something

524
00:24:12,386 --> 00:24:15,016
so that we can extend

525
00:24:15,166 --> 00:24:17,526
in a backwards-compatible way

526
00:24:17,856 --> 00:24:19,576
without breaking

527
00:24:20,426 --> 00:24:25,896
The current API version number

528
00:24:27,636 --> 00:24:31,326
The second parameter you pass

529
00:24:31,906 --> 00:24:34,076
If you are familiar

530
00:24:34,076 --> 00:24:36,136
this is the JavaScript

531
00:24:36,136 --> 00:24:37,746
of a PKPaymentRequest.

532
00:24:38,486 --> 00:24:41,266
So it then takes all the

533
00:24:41,266 --> 00:24:44,976
to display the sheet, things

534
00:24:44,976 --> 00:24:48,686
where the payment will be

535
00:24:48,876 --> 00:24:54,096
and optional list of line items,

536
00:24:54,096 --> 00:24:55,086
that might be required.

537
00:24:55,896 --> 00:24:59,326
And then when you get back your

538
00:24:59,586 --> 00:25:01,976
you simply call Begin and

539
00:24:59,586 --> 00:25:01,976
you simply call Begin and

540
00:25:02,046 --> 00:25:06,476
This is what it looks

541
00:25:06,906 --> 00:25:10,076
So first we declare our

542
00:25:10,756 --> 00:25:13,836
We specify the currencyCode

543
00:25:14,976 --> 00:25:17,796
And here I specified

544
00:25:18,516 --> 00:25:21,926
and the supported

545
00:25:21,926 --> 00:25:23,486
as the merchant capabilities.

546
00:25:24,056 --> 00:25:28,926
And lastly, I specified that

547
00:25:29,176 --> 00:25:30,766
for shipping purposes.

548
00:25:31,316 --> 00:25:35,106
And then I simply create

549
00:25:35,286 --> 00:25:37,446
I pass in the merchant

550
00:25:37,766 --> 00:25:39,086
and the payment request.

551
00:25:39,626 --> 00:25:45,486
And I call sessions up again

552
00:25:45,636 --> 00:25:49,726
Now with any payment API,

553
00:25:49,726 --> 00:25:52,116
that we get all the

554
00:25:52,436 --> 00:26:00,086
And because of this, before we

555
00:25:52,436 --> 00:26:00,086
And because of this, before we

556
00:26:00,086 --> 00:26:01,926
series of validation steps.

557
00:26:02,796 --> 00:26:07,696
And if any of these

558
00:26:07,696 --> 00:26:09,386
and just throw a

559
00:26:09,876 --> 00:26:14,446
And because of this, creating

560
00:26:14,446 --> 00:26:15,586
JavaScript exception.

561
00:26:16,056 --> 00:26:19,176
For example, if you call

562
00:26:19,586 --> 00:26:21,306
a page that it's not served

563
00:26:21,306 --> 00:26:26,056
over HTTPS using the best

564
00:26:27,116 --> 00:26:31,746
In fact, every single Apple

565
00:26:31,746 --> 00:26:34,906
exception if you try to call

566
00:26:37,156 --> 00:26:40,306
Creating an Apple Pay session

567
00:26:40,306 --> 00:26:42,696
if you pass in an

568
00:26:43,156 --> 00:26:45,776
For example, if you

569
00:26:45,776 --> 00:26:49,976
of supported networks, or

570
00:26:49,976 --> 00:26:51,366
that is negative, for example,

571
00:26:51,796 --> 00:26:54,396
or if you spell the

572
00:26:54,396 --> 00:26:56,326
so that it's something

573
00:26:56,696 --> 00:26:57,786
that will throw an exception.

574
00:27:00,236 --> 00:27:04,956
In addition, calling Begin can

575
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:07,106
in -- try to call

576
00:27:07,106 --> 00:27:09,496
of an onclick handler,

577
00:27:10,006 --> 00:27:13,736
We do not allow displaying

578
00:27:13,736 --> 00:27:15,366
explicitly asked for it

579
00:27:15,366 --> 00:27:19,026
to be presented using

580
00:27:19,426 --> 00:27:23,056
Or if there is already a sheet

581
00:27:23,366 --> 00:27:24,906
we'll throw a JavaScript

582
00:27:25,616 --> 00:27:28,786
because we only allow showing

583
00:27:29,766 --> 00:27:33,346
And if you get one

584
00:27:33,826 --> 00:27:37,486
you can use the Web

585
00:27:37,796 --> 00:27:40,616
to get a more detailed look

586
00:27:42,816 --> 00:27:50,536
But if everything is good and

587
00:27:50,906 --> 00:27:52,496
we'll display the sheet.

588
00:27:53,646 --> 00:27:57,706
But notice that you can't

589
00:27:57,706 --> 00:28:00,456
yet; we have this

590
00:27:57,706 --> 00:28:00,456
yet; we have this

591
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:02,096
And that's because we haven't

592
00:28:02,096 --> 00:28:04,096
yet handled the merchant

593
00:28:04,126 --> 00:28:05,346
that Nick mentioned earlier.

594
00:28:06,046 --> 00:28:09,876
So shortly after the

595
00:28:10,136 --> 00:28:12,966
we will send a validateherchant

596
00:28:13,096 --> 00:28:14,656
to the ApplePaySession object.

597
00:28:15,536 --> 00:28:18,906
This DOM event has a

598
00:28:19,366 --> 00:28:22,576
and this is the URL that

599
00:28:22,576 --> 00:28:26,136
and have it load to create

600
00:28:27,006 --> 00:28:29,916
And then when you get back

601
00:28:30,206 --> 00:28:34,106
from your server, you simply

602
00:28:34,406 --> 00:28:36,506
pass in the session,

603
00:28:37,706 --> 00:28:40,636
Here is what a validatemerchant

604
00:28:42,456 --> 00:28:45,136
So here I call this

605
00:28:45,136 --> 00:28:45,906
that I have written.

606
00:28:46,256 --> 00:28:49,416
It returns a promise,

607
00:28:49,416 --> 00:28:51,216
to the merchant session.

608
00:28:51,756 --> 00:28:53,356
So when the promise is resolved,

609
00:28:53,716 --> 00:28:56,036
I simply call

610
00:28:56,336 --> 00:28:57,876
I pass in the merchant session,

611
00:28:58,036 --> 00:28:59,626
And that's how you do

612
00:29:00,556 --> 00:29:04,656
So now, when merchant

613
00:29:04,786 --> 00:29:06,846
the user can authorize

614
00:29:06,846 --> 00:29:09,176
on their phone or

615
00:29:09,566 --> 00:29:12,456
And when the payment

616
00:29:12,676 --> 00:29:15,256
we'll send a paymentauthorized

617
00:29:15,506 --> 00:29:16,986
to the Apple Pay session.

618
00:29:18,606 --> 00:29:20,986
This DOM event contains

619
00:29:21,446 --> 00:29:24,516
that has all the necessary

620
00:29:24,996 --> 00:29:27,836
So it's got things like

621
00:29:28,316 --> 00:29:31,756
information about the

622
00:29:31,756 --> 00:29:35,846
to make the payment; and it's

623
00:29:35,846 --> 00:29:38,586
itself that you send to

624
00:29:40,036 --> 00:29:44,706
And when you have sent that and

625
00:29:45,406 --> 00:29:48,276
and you get back a reply,

626
00:29:48,436 --> 00:29:51,926
and that will dismiss

627
00:29:52,956 --> 00:29:56,046
So here we have a

628
00:29:57,146 --> 00:29:58,826
I call sendPaymentToken.

629
00:29:58,826 --> 00:29:59,976
I pass in the token.

630
00:30:00,726 --> 00:30:04,346
And this returns a promise

631
00:30:04,916 --> 00:30:06,776
that is either true

632
00:30:06,776 --> 00:30:10,736
on whether the payment was

633
00:30:11,306 --> 00:30:13,746
So if it's true, I set my status

634
00:30:13,796 --> 00:30:16,276
to ApplePaySession.STATUS

635
00:30:17,226 --> 00:30:20,106
If it's false, for example, if

636
00:30:20,586 --> 00:30:23,646
I set my status to

637
00:30:25,026 --> 00:30:27,076
Then I call completePayment.

638
00:30:27,076 --> 00:30:30,106
I pass in the status, which

639
00:30:30,456 --> 00:30:32,786
And then I call this

640
00:30:32,786 --> 00:30:36,436
which will show a nice little

641
00:30:36,436 --> 00:30:38,816
And when you call

642
00:30:38,816 --> 00:30:41,806
in Success, you get

643
00:30:42,016 --> 00:30:44,166
and the sheet will be dismissed.

644
00:30:45,066 --> 00:30:49,336
OK. So now let's take a

645
00:30:49,336 --> 00:30:49,976
to do all of these things.

646
00:30:57,096 --> 00:30:59,216
Here we go.

647
00:30:59,446 --> 00:31:02,646
So first of all,

648
00:30:59,446 --> 00:31:02,646
So first of all,

649
00:31:04,546 --> 00:31:07,506
And now let's take a

650
00:31:08,046 --> 00:31:12,066
But before we start adding

651
00:31:12,066 --> 00:31:13,246
out a couple of things.

652
00:31:13,686 --> 00:31:16,726
Here I have added

653
00:31:17,206 --> 00:31:20,756
These are used in the Safari

654
00:31:20,756 --> 00:31:25,066
but they are also used in the

655
00:31:25,116 --> 00:31:26,096
which we will see later.

656
00:31:27,636 --> 00:31:30,276
And here I have listed

657
00:31:30,316 --> 00:31:33,636
and I have actually gone ahead

658
00:31:33,636 --> 00:31:36,486
I am just keeping them

659
00:31:36,486 --> 00:31:40,576
So let's take a look at that.

660
00:31:40,686 --> 00:31:42,866
Here is my CSS, and

661
00:31:42,866 --> 00:31:44,046
for the Apple Pay button.

662
00:31:44,476 --> 00:31:47,416
So I set this visibility

663
00:31:47,886 --> 00:31:50,066
And for the actual image itself,

664
00:31:50,066 --> 00:31:52,556
I am using this

665
00:31:52,846 --> 00:31:56,166
so we can grab the Apple Pay

666
00:31:56,166 --> 00:31:58,216
so you don't have to

667
00:31:59,466 --> 00:32:01,816
OK. So the first thing we want

668
00:31:59,466 --> 00:32:01,816
OK. So the first thing we want

669
00:32:01,816 --> 00:32:05,716
to do now is add the code

670
00:32:05,766 --> 00:32:07,806
if Apple Pay is enabled.

671
00:32:08,686 --> 00:32:11,806
So I have already started

672
00:32:11,806 --> 00:32:15,246
I have created an EventListener

673
00:32:15,726 --> 00:32:16,906
This event is dispatched

674
00:32:16,906 --> 00:32:18,896
when the main document

675
00:32:18,896 --> 00:32:21,206
but before any remaining images

676
00:32:21,206 --> 00:32:22,976
from other resources

677
00:32:22,976 --> 00:32:24,356
So it's a good place to do that.

678
00:32:24,896 --> 00:32:27,186
So let me add the

679
00:32:27,906 --> 00:32:29,686
Again, I am checking

680
00:32:29,686 --> 00:32:31,536
of the ApplePaySession object.

681
00:32:31,696 --> 00:32:33,896
Then I call

682
00:32:34,526 --> 00:32:37,986
And inside my promise function,

683
00:32:37,986 --> 00:32:40,396
and if it's true I call

684
00:32:41,026 --> 00:32:43,656
So I -- let me save

685
00:32:44,066 --> 00:32:44,806
And we load.

686
00:32:44,846 --> 00:32:46,836
And now we got our

687
00:32:47,766 --> 00:32:50,946
So the next step is

688
00:32:50,946 --> 00:32:52,616
when a user clicks on a button.

689
00:32:52,616 --> 00:32:55,746
So I have written this

690
00:32:56,226 --> 00:32:59,856
that is invoked whenever

691
00:33:00,526 --> 00:33:04,766
So here is where we want to add

692
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:08,716
So again I have declared my

693
00:33:08,716 --> 00:33:12,156
I have hard-coded the amounts

694
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:16,206
but in real life we would

695
00:33:16,466 --> 00:33:19,376
And I then create my new

696
00:33:19,376 --> 00:33:20,456
and I call Begin.

697
00:33:20,576 --> 00:33:24,616
So let me save and reload

698
00:33:28,296 --> 00:33:31,306
OK. So it looks like

699
00:33:31,306 --> 00:33:35,046
So let me open the Error console

700
00:33:37,366 --> 00:33:38,596
OK, so it says that

701
00:33:38,596 --> 00:33:41,596
"supportednetwork" is not

702
00:33:41,646 --> 00:33:44,236
And it looks like I

703
00:33:44,696 --> 00:33:50,906
So let me just go back

704
00:33:52,576 --> 00:33:54,026
And now we have the sheet.

705
00:33:54,646 --> 00:33:57,276
But I can still not

706
00:33:57,356 --> 00:33:59,566
because I haven't handled

707
00:33:59,956 --> 00:34:03,536
So let's go ahead and do that.

708
00:33:59,956 --> 00:34:03,536
So let's go ahead and do that.

709
00:34:03,736 --> 00:34:06,586
So I want to add my

710
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:09,606
And I'll do it here after

711
00:34:09,846 --> 00:34:11,315
but before we call Begin.

712
00:34:11,886 --> 00:34:14,166
And again I call

713
00:34:14,596 --> 00:34:18,116
And when the promise that this

714
00:34:18,536 --> 00:34:20,356
I call

715
00:34:20,396 --> 00:34:21,956
I pass in my merchant session.

716
00:34:22,436 --> 00:34:28,356
And then I should be able

717
00:34:28,766 --> 00:34:29,896
And the last thing we need

718
00:34:29,896 --> 00:34:33,206
to do now is add our

719
00:34:34,556 --> 00:34:40,356
And this will send the

720
00:34:40,856 --> 00:34:42,866
and confirm the payment.

721
00:34:42,866 --> 00:34:45,795
And if we are successful,

722
00:34:46,286 --> 00:34:47,735
otherwise I set it to FAILURE.

723
00:34:48,126 --> 00:34:51,286
And then I call completePayment

724
00:34:51,636 --> 00:34:56,636
So now I want to

725
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:59,976
so we can actually see what this

726
00:35:00,166 --> 00:35:04,066
So let me reload, and I hit Pay.

727
00:35:05,166 --> 00:35:06,476
And now I can confirm.

728
00:35:06,476 --> 00:35:09,546
And as you can see, I get

729
00:35:09,546 --> 00:35:12,206
That's because I added

730
00:35:12,876 --> 00:35:16,146
And now I can pay

731
00:35:16,636 --> 00:35:17,976
And the scarf is on its way.

[ Applause ]

733
00:35:28,406 --> 00:35:32,016
So that's how easy it is to

734
00:35:32,666 --> 00:35:35,816
And I think that

735

in the doghouse.

Aw, come on.

Throw me a bone.

I'm wasted in software

745
00:36:01,306 --> 00:36:01,936
All right.

746
00:36:02,036 --> 00:36:08,476
So we have seen how to build

747
00:36:08,716 --> 00:36:11,176
Let's talk about something

748
00:36:11,176 --> 00:36:11,476
to you.

749
00:36:11,736 --> 00:36:13,256
That's how you'll

750

how to get some money

So Anders covered these steps up

752
00:36:22,426 --> 00:36:24,246
What happens next?

753
00:36:25,856 --> 00:36:29,346
Well you have two options,

754
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:35,086
The first option is to decrypt

755
00:36:35,086 --> 00:36:36,876
on your own servers.

756
00:36:38,236 --> 00:36:40,606
That's a good option if you

757
00:36:40,606 --> 00:36:42,836
or you have a very large

758
00:36:42,896 --> 00:36:45,186
You're familiar with the

759
00:36:45,186 --> 00:36:46,846
It is documented, though,

760
00:36:47,576 --> 00:36:50,306
But another option

761
00:36:50,306 --> 00:36:52,406
to just pass this

762
00:36:52,706 --> 00:36:56,486
to your payment provider, and

763
00:36:56,486 --> 00:36:58,866
on your behalf if you

764
00:37:00,456 --> 00:37:02,216
This is a really easy option,

765
00:37:02,216 --> 00:37:05,246
and many payment

766
00:37:05,246 --> 00:37:06,856
to do this in-app.

767
00:37:06,856 --> 00:37:07,986
We are highly confident

768
00:37:07,986 --> 00:37:10,236
that these payment processors

769
00:37:10,236 --> 00:37:12,316
JavaScript-based SDKs;

770
00:37:12,316 --> 00:37:14,636
these integrate directly

771
00:37:15,456 --> 00:37:18,476
In fact, in the U.S. and Europe

772
00:37:18,476 --> 00:37:22,036
over 40 payment processors

773
00:37:22,086 --> 00:37:23,886
too many for me to

774
00:37:24,276 --> 00:37:26,736
But there's a full list

775
00:37:28,176 --> 00:37:31,026
And as I said, many of these

776
00:37:31,026 --> 00:37:33,506
for in-app; and they'll

777
00:37:33,506 --> 00:37:34,246
for the web as well.

778
00:37:35,516 --> 00:37:39,116
I also want to highlight

779
00:37:39,326 --> 00:37:41,886
As you may know, Apple

780
00:37:41,886 --> 00:37:44,366
And of course this feature

781
00:37:44,366 --> 00:37:45,356
as in the U.S. and Europe.

782
00:37:45,676 --> 00:37:47,716
And we have four payment

783
00:37:47,956 --> 00:37:49,496
that support Apple Pay.

784
00:37:49,776 --> 00:37:53,856
They are China UMS, LianLianPay,

785
00:37:54,126 --> 00:37:56,306
So if you are looking to

786
00:37:56,306 --> 00:37:58,716
in Asia, you have got great

787
00:38:00,666 --> 00:38:04,736
Now one thing I mentioned at the

788
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:08,316
Many sites don't build

789
00:38:08,316 --> 00:38:11,866
They use the platforms provided

790
00:38:12,366 --> 00:38:13,196
And we are partnering

791
00:38:13,196 --> 00:38:16,016
with multiple eCommerce

792
00:38:16,426 --> 00:38:18,466
We are partnering with

793
00:38:18,786 --> 00:38:20,626
They are Demandware,

794
00:38:20,626 --> 00:38:25,036
And if you are using any

795
00:38:25,036 --> 00:38:28,016
you will be able to use

796
00:38:28,016 --> 00:38:30,386
you will be able to use

797
00:38:30,386 --> 00:38:31,576
to have a developer account.

798
00:38:32,456 --> 00:38:34,946
These platforms can

799
00:38:34,946 --> 00:38:36,846
They can handle all

800
00:38:36,846 --> 00:38:38,976
with their deep Apple

801
00:38:43,266 --> 00:38:45,166
Now you are probably

802
00:38:45,166 --> 00:38:46,066
to go off and try this.

803
00:38:46,066 --> 00:38:46,666
I hope you are.

804
00:38:47,606 --> 00:38:50,066
I want to talk a

805
00:38:51,386 --> 00:38:53,736
So testing your sites:

806
00:38:54,046 --> 00:38:55,816
We are introducing a

807
00:38:55,816 --> 00:38:58,306
for Apple Pay called

808
00:38:58,826 --> 00:39:00,856
It's a new way to test.

809
00:38:58,826 --> 00:39:00,856
It's a new way to test.

810
00:39:00,856 --> 00:39:03,886
And initially Apple Pay for

811
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:05,046
within this sandbox.

812
00:39:05,746 --> 00:39:07,446
Now if you'd like

813
00:39:07,536 --> 00:39:09,366
we don't quite have enough

814
00:39:09,616 --> 00:39:12,026
But you can check the

815
00:39:12,026 --> 00:39:13,726
we are going to be

816
00:39:13,876 --> 00:39:16,476
Or if you go to our site

817
00:39:16,726 --> 00:39:18,606
we have some information

818
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:19,836
to use the Apple Pay Sandbox.

819
00:39:20,026 --> 00:39:21,986
But for the initial seeds,

820
00:39:21,986 --> 00:39:23,296
to test Apple Pay on the web.

821
00:39:23,586 --> 00:39:25,626
Then we'll roll it out into

822
00:39:25,826 --> 00:39:28,946
as we near the release of

823
00:39:36,856 --> 00:39:39,836
Now also, when testing

824
00:39:39,836 --> 00:39:43,456
please give us some feedback,

825
00:39:43,736 --> 00:39:46,926
We really want to hear about

826
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:48,346
and all the great

827
00:39:48,346 --> 00:39:49,416
If you just have compliments,

828
00:39:49,466 --> 00:39:51,276
I'd love to receive

829
00:39:52,416 --> 00:39:59,116
OK. Let's talk about the final

830
00:39:59,556 --> 00:40:02,976
How to build a compelling

831
00:39:59,556 --> 00:40:02,976
How to build a compelling

832
00:40:03,176 --> 00:40:06,716
And a lot of these tips are

833
00:40:07,276 --> 00:40:10,826
At the start of this

834
00:40:10,826 --> 00:40:15,456
about how Apple Pay has three

835
00:40:15,646 --> 00:40:18,466
secure, and private way to pay.

836
00:40:19,006 --> 00:40:21,846
And your designs

837
00:40:22,476 --> 00:40:23,686
They shouldn't make

838
00:40:23,726 --> 00:40:26,276
They shouldn't make it

839
00:40:26,816 --> 00:40:29,576
There are three main

840
00:40:30,096 --> 00:40:31,386
There's pre-payment,

841
00:40:32,016 --> 00:40:35,476
that's before you have seen the

842
00:40:35,476 --> 00:40:38,066
of using Apple Pay before

843
00:40:39,316 --> 00:40:42,266
There's payment itself,

844
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:44,776
when the sheet's

845
00:40:45,226 --> 00:40:46,136
You can customize that.

846
00:40:46,136 --> 00:40:47,196
How should you customize it?

847
00:40:47,376 --> 00:40:47,996
We'll find out.

848
00:40:49,286 --> 00:40:50,726
There's also post-payments.

849
00:40:51,686 --> 00:40:54,566
That's the experience after

850
00:40:55,496 --> 00:40:57,786
So let's run through

851
00:40:57,786 --> 00:41:01,446
and discuss how your

852
00:40:57,786 --> 00:41:01,446
and discuss how your

853
00:41:01,446 --> 00:41:04,146
with Apple Pay for each phase.

854
00:41:04,956 --> 00:41:07,656
Prepayment starts with

855
00:41:08,156 --> 00:41:11,056
And the Apple Pay button is

856
00:41:11,056 --> 00:41:15,606
and, as I've just shown you,

857
00:41:15,606 --> 00:41:16,726
that you can use as well.

858
00:41:17,116 --> 00:41:19,156
It's available in a

859
00:41:19,236 --> 00:41:20,816
Here are a couple of them.

860
00:41:20,816 --> 00:41:23,346
And Anders showed you the CSS,

861
00:41:23,346 --> 00:41:28,536
but just to reiterate we have

862
00:41:28,536 --> 00:41:29,276
that you can use.

863
00:41:29,746 --> 00:41:32,446
You can get an Apple

864
00:41:32,446 --> 00:41:34,606
that for your buttons

865
00:41:35,516 --> 00:41:37,806
There are some do's and

866
00:41:37,846 --> 00:41:38,986
when you are using

867
00:41:39,636 --> 00:41:41,856
Do use the built-in assets.

868
00:41:42,626 --> 00:41:45,196
Sometimes, you never know,

869
00:41:45,196 --> 00:41:46,746
You want to make sure

870
00:41:47,616 --> 00:41:50,886
Also, place wherever a user

871
00:41:50,886 --> 00:41:51,756
Don't hide it away.

872
00:41:51,756 --> 00:41:54,106
Don't make it difficult

873
00:41:54,106 --> 00:41:56,336
with what is a very

874
00:41:57,086 --> 00:41:58,726
There is also some don'ts.

875
00:41:59,446 --> 00:42:03,586
Don't modify the button, or

876
00:41:59,446 --> 00:42:03,586
Don't modify the button, or

877
00:42:04,286 --> 00:42:06,666
It's very important

878
00:42:06,666 --> 00:42:08,646
on an Apple Pay button,

879
00:42:08,646 --> 00:42:10,496
We want that expectation

880
00:42:10,996 --> 00:42:12,896
And also don't suppress

881
00:42:12,896 --> 00:42:16,056
As part of the Apple Pay

882
00:42:16,056 --> 00:42:17,536
to suppress the button.

883
00:42:17,536 --> 00:42:20,606
It needs to be at the same level

884
00:42:21,106 --> 00:42:25,306
Let's talk about where

885
00:42:26,706 --> 00:42:28,876
Now Anders' demo showed you how

886
00:42:28,876 --> 00:42:31,436
to place the Apple Pay button

887
00:42:32,556 --> 00:42:35,866
And placing it on product pages

888
00:42:35,866 --> 00:42:38,686
We've seen some great data from

889
00:42:38,686 --> 00:42:41,226
to show they've seen

890
00:42:41,226 --> 00:42:44,066
when they place the Apple Pay

891
00:42:44,746 --> 00:42:46,306
Now obviously you

892
00:42:46,306 --> 00:42:48,676
in regular checkout

893
00:42:49,376 --> 00:42:50,566
Let's look at a few examples.

894
00:42:50,566 --> 00:42:54,946
We gave the Apple Pay API to

895
00:42:54,946 --> 00:42:57,186
to come up with some designs

896
00:42:57,696 --> 00:42:59,376
and some experiences

897
00:43:00,736 --> 00:43:02,106
Here's one from StubHub.

898
00:43:03,636 --> 00:43:05,946
Now StubHub has decided to a Buy

899
00:43:05,946 --> 00:43:08,236
with Apple Pay button during

900
00:43:08,236 --> 00:43:09,796
You select the number

901
00:43:09,796 --> 00:43:12,796
and then you just

902
00:43:13,036 --> 00:43:14,746
You can also bring

903
00:43:14,746 --> 00:43:17,486
You can do what I call

904
00:43:17,586 --> 00:43:19,326
This is from Warby Parker.

905
00:43:20,186 --> 00:43:21,926
This is after you have

906
00:43:22,736 --> 00:43:23,716
You see we have two options.

907
00:43:23,716 --> 00:43:26,576
We can add the product to our

908
00:43:27,126 --> 00:43:29,746
or you can just buy it there

909
00:43:31,096 --> 00:43:33,566
Finally, you can place

910
00:43:33,566 --> 00:43:34,946
on your actual product pages.

911
00:43:35,616 --> 00:43:37,396
Here's an example

912
00:43:37,786 --> 00:43:40,646
The Apple Pay button right

913
00:43:40,766 --> 00:43:42,646
Let me show you that

914
00:43:42,646 --> 00:43:45,396
Here you can see there's

915
00:43:45,396 --> 00:43:48,806
So if I want to create my

916
00:43:49,106 --> 00:43:53,506
Or I can just buy

917
00:43:53,716 --> 00:43:55,956
Now one thing that

918
00:43:55,956 --> 00:43:59,216
on the product pages is

919
00:43:59,776 --> 00:44:03,166
Required registration is a

920
00:43:59,776 --> 00:44:03,166
Required registration is a

921
00:44:03,166 --> 00:44:05,776
I don't know about you, but I've

922
00:44:05,986 --> 00:44:08,316
because the site I didn't

923
00:44:08,316 --> 00:44:09,836
to create an account up front.

924
00:44:11,486 --> 00:44:14,146
And so Apple Pay can help

925
00:44:14,146 --> 00:44:17,086
by making guest checkout

926
00:44:18,356 --> 00:44:20,876
Also, you can optionally

927
00:44:20,876 --> 00:44:22,266
collect in the Apple Pay sheet

928
00:44:22,786 --> 00:44:25,296
to create accounts

929
00:44:25,936 --> 00:44:28,676
I'll show you an example of that

930
00:44:29,226 --> 00:44:33,566
Let's move on now to actual

931
00:44:34,116 --> 00:44:37,946
Now the Apple Pay sheet

932
00:44:37,946 --> 00:44:38,746
for merchants.

933
00:44:38,896 --> 00:44:40,256
It's highly customizable,

934
00:44:40,746 --> 00:44:44,826
but it also offers a

935
00:44:45,546 --> 00:44:48,366
You can decide what

936
00:44:48,366 --> 00:44:50,956
but the user always

937
00:44:51,576 --> 00:44:54,866
Here is an example of

938
00:44:54,866 --> 00:44:56,676
I am using the Mac OS sheet.

939
00:44:57,236 --> 00:45:00,546
But the same fields

940
00:44:57,236 --> 00:45:00,546
But the same fields

941
00:45:00,546 --> 00:45:03,976
if you're making a web payment

942
00:45:05,446 --> 00:45:08,606
The first field is where

943
00:45:08,606 --> 00:45:11,346
It's also optionally where you

944
00:45:11,386 --> 00:45:13,036
although billing

945
00:45:13,036 --> 00:45:14,296
to process an Apple Pay payment.

946
00:45:15,616 --> 00:45:17,606
The next field is shipping.

947
00:45:19,016 --> 00:45:21,666
This is where you request

948
00:45:22,156 --> 00:45:25,816
You can request billing,

949
00:45:25,816 --> 00:45:27,806
and contact information

950
00:45:28,126 --> 00:45:31,646
and you can also specify

951
00:45:32,256 --> 00:45:33,696
You can change the terminology.

952
00:45:33,696 --> 00:45:34,626
If you don't like it saying --

953
00:45:34,626 --> 00:45:37,286
to say "shipping," you can

954
00:45:37,896 --> 00:45:39,446
It's good if you're

955
00:45:39,446 --> 00:45:41,036
or maybe a takeaway service.

956
00:45:44,276 --> 00:45:46,946
Now you can list

957
00:45:47,396 --> 00:45:49,036
You can list them

958
00:45:49,236 --> 00:45:50,716
which we'll talk

959
00:45:51,086 --> 00:45:54,336
But when you're collecting

960
00:45:54,336 --> 00:45:56,666
make sure you have a

961
00:45:56,946 --> 00:45:59,506
When you use Apple Pay within

962
00:45:59,506 --> 00:46:00,686
to the App Store

963
00:45:59,506 --> 00:46:00,686
to the App Store

964
00:46:00,686 --> 00:46:02,436
to provide a link

965
00:46:02,876 --> 00:46:04,206
Now when you are

966
00:46:04,586 --> 00:46:06,266
obviously there is

967
00:46:06,266 --> 00:46:09,356
So instead we just ask that you

968
00:46:09,356 --> 00:46:12,106
on your site that clearly

969
00:46:12,106 --> 00:46:13,166
to do with this information.

970
00:46:13,576 --> 00:46:17,656
Now you can also

971
00:46:18,316 --> 00:46:20,276
that lets you select

972
00:46:21,596 --> 00:46:24,796
And just like the shipping

973
00:46:25,776 --> 00:46:27,566
Users can pick from

974
00:46:27,656 --> 00:46:29,836
Now these methods can

975
00:46:29,836 --> 00:46:31,316
to address changes perhaps

976
00:46:31,316 --> 00:46:33,866
if you already offer express

977
00:46:34,056 --> 00:46:36,226
you can easily reflect that.

978
00:46:36,636 --> 00:46:39,616
Methods could also be free if

979
00:46:40,266 --> 00:46:41,526
And just like shipping

980
00:46:41,706 --> 00:46:43,976
the naming can be

981
00:46:47,606 --> 00:46:49,826
Now although you

982
00:46:49,826 --> 00:46:52,426
and phone number in

983
00:46:52,846 --> 00:46:54,426
they are separate

984
00:46:55,266 --> 00:46:56,786
So this field here,

985
00:46:56,786 --> 00:46:58,656
is where you enter

986
00:46:58,656 --> 00:46:59,546
than postal address.

987
00:46:59,906 --> 00:47:01,746
Now we support collecting

988
00:46:59,906 --> 00:47:01,746
Now we support collecting

989
00:47:02,296 --> 00:47:03,916
We support collecting

990
00:47:04,156 --> 00:47:06,186
And if you are not

991
00:47:06,386 --> 00:47:08,536
we also allow you to

992
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:12,516
That's useful if maybe you

993
00:47:12,516 --> 00:47:14,046
and you want to have

994
00:47:14,046 --> 00:47:15,826
but you don't need

995
00:47:18,596 --> 00:47:21,936
Now is the most important field,

996
00:47:22,896 --> 00:47:25,426
This highlights the amount

997
00:47:25,646 --> 00:47:27,096
sorry, that the user

998
00:47:28,246 --> 00:47:30,066
And you can use this

999
00:47:30,296 --> 00:47:33,036
to display a concise indication

1000
00:47:33,396 --> 00:47:36,406
Things like subtotals,

1001
00:47:36,926 --> 00:47:40,076
Now it's not a line-by-line

1002
00:47:40,076 --> 00:47:42,016
It's not intended to

1003
00:47:42,416 --> 00:47:44,746
So you should keep it concise.

1004
00:47:45,916 --> 00:47:48,616
Also, be upfront and clear

1005
00:47:49,316 --> 00:47:52,356
Make sure that the total amount

1006
00:47:52,356 --> 00:47:55,326
actually going to be

1007
00:47:55,326 --> 00:47:57,496
That being said,

1008
00:47:57,496 --> 00:47:59,886
where you don't necessarily know

1009
00:48:00,766 --> 00:48:02,396
Sometimes you don't

1010
00:48:02,936 --> 00:48:05,016
Maybe it's a hotel

1011
00:48:05,316 --> 00:48:07,826
or car hire, or a taxi service.

1012
00:48:08,756 --> 00:48:11,016
And you can use the

1013
00:48:11,016 --> 00:48:12,996
on our summary item

1014
00:48:14,636 --> 00:48:16,836
Now again, just make

1015
00:48:17,486 --> 00:48:19,316
Why do I keep saying

1016
00:48:19,806 --> 00:48:22,646
Well as you may have seen

1017
00:48:22,646 --> 00:48:25,976
with Apple Pay normally you'll

1018
00:48:26,056 --> 00:48:28,256
from your bank with the

1019
00:48:28,256 --> 00:48:29,876
So you want to make sure

1020
00:48:29,876 --> 00:48:32,956
on the sheet matches this,

1021
00:48:32,956 --> 00:48:34,556
in the case where you

1022
00:48:34,556 --> 00:48:35,806
final amount.

1023
00:48:37,456 --> 00:48:40,396
Summary items also support

1024
00:48:40,936 --> 00:48:42,366
Items can be marked as free.

1025
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:46,216
And summary items can also be

1026
00:48:46,336 --> 00:48:48,776
The total amount needs

1027
00:48:49,066 --> 00:48:50,166
But anything before that,

1028
00:48:50,166 --> 00:48:52,766
if you want to indicate a

1029
00:48:53,326 --> 00:48:58,766
Now there's one other

1030
00:48:59,266 --> 00:49:03,156
and that's the field that tells

1031
00:48:59,266 --> 00:49:03,156
and that's the field that tells

1032
00:49:04,486 --> 00:49:06,386
Which brings me to

1033
00:49:07,766 --> 00:49:09,076
around the site icon.

1034
00:49:09,356 --> 00:49:13,056
So this is a sheet on iPhone

1035
00:49:13,576 --> 00:49:15,356
You can't customize

1036
00:49:15,536 --> 00:49:17,586
We inform you of the card,

1037
00:49:17,586 --> 00:49:18,716
you need to do that on a Mac.

1038
00:49:19,366 --> 00:49:20,656
By the way, if you

1039
00:49:20,656 --> 00:49:22,876
on the Mac the price here

1040
00:49:22,906 --> 00:49:24,866
So if you change shipping

1041
00:49:24,866 --> 00:49:27,086
that costs more, we'll

1042
00:49:27,086 --> 00:49:32,006
But this site icon is

1043
00:49:32,206 --> 00:49:34,416
You can specify it

1044
00:49:34,976 --> 00:49:40,126
It uses the existing Apple Touch

1045
00:49:40,126 --> 00:49:44,686
for Apple Pay at 180

1046
00:49:45,266 --> 00:49:49,046
The easiest way to specify this

1047
00:49:49,856 --> 00:49:54,126
But you can also specify at

1048
00:49:55,616 --> 00:49:57,016
Whatever works best for you.

1049
00:49:58,216 --> 00:49:59,966
I'd also like to briefly

1050
00:50:00,086 --> 00:50:01,996
That's semantic markup.

1051
00:50:02,346 --> 00:50:05,216
So many of you may already

1052
00:50:05,216 --> 00:50:08,156
on your pages to indicate

1053
00:50:08,156 --> 00:50:10,156
that are available for

1054
00:50:10,466 --> 00:50:13,076
We actually index the

1055
00:50:13,076 --> 00:50:14,986
in Spotlight on iOS.

1056
00:50:15,656 --> 00:50:17,886
You can also indicate that

1057
00:50:17,886 --> 00:50:19,816
appropriate semantic markup.

1058
00:50:19,816 --> 00:50:22,976
We think this will benefit,

1059
00:50:23,106 --> 00:50:25,256
people who want to know where

1060
00:50:25,356 --> 00:50:28,056
if you'd like to

1061
00:50:29,126 --> 00:50:31,096
OK, let's move on

1062
00:50:31,096 --> 00:50:32,766
of payment, the confirmation.

1063
00:50:33,346 --> 00:50:35,686
Now in your confirmation

1064
00:50:35,686 --> 00:50:38,286
to reflect the appropriate

1065
00:50:38,806 --> 00:50:42,036
So for example, don't

1066
00:50:42,036 --> 00:50:43,046
if you returned a failure.

1067
00:50:43,296 --> 00:50:43,956
That would be silly.

1068
00:50:43,956 --> 00:50:47,276
You can also leverage

1069
00:50:47,276 --> 00:50:49,226
by Apple Pay to offer

1070
00:50:49,226 --> 00:50:50,146
I mentioned this earlier.

1071
00:50:50,146 --> 00:50:53,266
I want to show you an example

1072
00:50:53,266 --> 00:50:55,196
Here's an example.

1073
00:50:55,346 --> 00:50:57,196
After you have made

1074
00:50:57,736 --> 00:50:58,956
you get a confirmation page

1075
00:50:59,376 --> 00:51:03,356
and you actually get a create

1076
00:50:59,376 --> 00:51:03,356
and you actually get a create

1077
00:51:03,356 --> 00:51:04,756
pre-populated with

1078
00:51:04,756 --> 00:51:05,676
that came from Apple Pay.

1079
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:08,156
So I can create an

1080
00:51:08,396 --> 00:51:10,376
I can enter into a

1081
00:51:10,506 --> 00:51:11,636
and it's easy to do so.

1082
00:51:14,006 --> 00:51:16,446
OK. We covered quite

1083
00:51:17,166 --> 00:51:18,286
What did we cover?

1084
00:51:19,486 --> 00:51:21,446
We covered Apply Pay merchant

1085
00:51:21,526 --> 00:51:24,696
We learned about the differences

1086
00:51:25,876 --> 00:51:28,566
We also covered the Apple

1087
00:51:28,566 --> 00:51:29,116
with Anders.

1088
00:51:29,276 --> 00:51:33,176
And we also talked

1089
00:51:33,176 --> 00:51:35,396
of Apple Pay in our designs.

1090
00:51:35,396 --> 00:51:39,496
Now we have a lot of information

1091
00:51:39,986 --> 00:51:43,096
You can check out our developer

1092
00:51:43,806 --> 00:51:45,386
We've also got the

1093
00:51:46,176 --> 00:51:47,586
Firstly, don't go anywhere.

1094
00:51:48,006 --> 00:51:48,816
Stay right here.

1095
00:51:48,976 --> 00:51:49,636
Don't you even leave.

1096
00:51:49,636 --> 00:51:52,326
I am going to be right back here

1097
00:51:52,326 --> 00:51:53,336
with Wallet &amp; Apple Pay.

1098
00:51:53,586 --> 00:51:54,986
We're going to talk

1099
00:51:55,186 --> 00:51:56,416
We're going to talk

1100
00:51:56,586 --> 00:51:57,876
We're going to talk

1101
00:51:57,976 --> 00:52:00,636
And we're going to talk about

1102
00:51:57,976 --> 00:52:00,636
And we're going to talk about

1103
00:52:00,636 --> 00:52:03,036
and Apple Pay for

1104
00:52:03,366 --> 00:52:06,256
There's also a session

1105
00:52:06,346 --> 00:52:08,416
Optimizing Web Content

1106
00:52:08,866 --> 00:52:10,336
That is Friday at 4:00.

1107
00:52:10,966 --> 00:52:12,116
That's everything from us.

1108
00:52:12,396 --> 00:52:13,636
Thank you so much for coming.

1109
00:52:13,686 --> 00:52:16,126
I can't wait to see all the

1110
00:52:16,126 --> 00:52:16,956
with Apple Pay on the web.

1111
00:52:17,336 --> 00:52:18,976
Thank you, and have

1112
00:52:19,016 --> 00:52:21,000
[ Applause ]
