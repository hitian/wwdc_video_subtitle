00:00:20,346 --> 00:00:23,766
&gt;&gt; Hello. My name is Ellis

3
00:00:23,766 --> 00:00:25,726
for public transit

4
00:00:26,166 --> 00:00:28,086
Our goal here at Apple is always

5
00:00:28,086 --> 00:00:30,596
to create the best possible

6
00:00:31,176 --> 00:00:32,996
We believe that design

7
00:00:32,996 --> 00:00:35,396
about how something

8
00:00:35,986 --> 00:00:38,776
Great experiences are

9
00:00:39,326 --> 00:00:42,486
In this talk, I'd like to

10
00:00:42,486 --> 00:00:44,086
to transit in Apple Maps.

11
00:00:44,446 --> 00:00:45,836
But first, I'd like to start

12
00:00:45,836 --> 00:00:50,886
by giving you an

13
00:00:50,976 --> 00:00:55,156
Transit launched in September

14
00:00:55,336 --> 00:00:57,016
and Mac OS X, El Capitan.

15
00:00:57,016 --> 00:01:02,126
As of today, it is available

16
00:00:57,016 --> 00:01:02,126
As of today, it is available

17
00:01:02,126 --> 00:01:04,385
as well as over 300

18
00:01:05,616 --> 00:01:09,756
We use transit schedule data

19
00:01:10,996 --> 00:01:12,286
Here's a bit of a fun fact.

20
00:01:12,586 --> 00:01:16,576
To date, we've mapped more

21
00:01:17,726 --> 00:01:19,556
Next, I'd like to

22
00:01:19,656 --> 00:01:21,856
of the four key features

23
00:01:22,456 --> 00:01:26,586
The first is a beautiful

24
00:01:27,166 --> 00:01:29,926
Roads and other driving-related

25
00:01:29,926 --> 00:01:32,316
out while transit

26
00:01:32,316 --> 00:01:34,276
and transfer stations

27
00:01:38,626 --> 00:01:40,656
The second feature

28
00:01:40,656 --> 00:01:43,976
for each station showing each

29
00:01:49,376 --> 00:01:52,696
The third is detailed point

30
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:54,726
with a guided navigation

31
00:01:58,556 --> 00:02:01,236
Finally, we show

32
00:01:58,556 --> 00:02:01,236
Finally, we show

33
00:02:01,236 --> 00:02:04,646
and even modify our recommended

34
00:02:04,766 --> 00:02:07,556
to planned service changes

35
00:02:11,216 --> 00:02:13,886
Our goal is to provide

36
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:15,566
in each city we support.

37
00:02:16,296 --> 00:02:17,676
So how do we do that?

38
00:02:17,996 --> 00:02:21,436
We start with agency schedule

39
00:02:21,936 --> 00:02:23,246
We collect additional data

40
00:02:23,246 --> 00:02:25,566
through original research

41
00:02:26,026 --> 00:02:28,486
Then we add in a layer

42
00:02:28,486 --> 00:02:29,916
and delight our customers.

43
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:33,556
Our goal is that at every

44
00:02:33,556 --> 00:02:36,466
to match the instruction we're

45
00:02:36,466 --> 00:02:38,636
in the real world around them.

46
00:02:39,266 --> 00:02:41,416
Gathering these details

47
00:02:41,636 --> 00:02:44,766
But as Steve Jobs once

48
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:46,896
It's worth waiting

49
00:02:49,906 --> 00:02:52,136
Here are some examples

50
00:02:52,136 --> 00:02:53,616
that we collect ourselves.

51
00:02:56,106 --> 00:02:57,976
Station entrances and exits.

52
00:03:00,126 --> 00:03:02,936
Station footprints or

53
00:03:04,876 --> 00:03:06,036
Agency signage.

54
00:03:06,426 --> 00:03:11,436
And the real world

55
00:03:11,516 --> 00:03:14,316
by which I mean the path

56
00:03:14,316 --> 00:03:20,806
and ferries actually

57
00:03:21,056 --> 00:03:23,696
This example shows a

58
00:03:24,126 --> 00:03:26,976
We've individually surveys

59
00:03:26,976 --> 00:03:28,746
for location but also type.

60
00:03:29,076 --> 00:03:31,996
Stairs, escalator,

61
00:03:35,626 --> 00:03:38,556
Here is that same entrance

62
00:03:39,086 --> 00:03:41,106
You can also see the

63
00:03:41,856 --> 00:03:44,946
This is really helpful in

64
00:03:44,946 --> 00:03:46,216
and out of train stations.

65
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:52,486
Stations have different names

66
00:03:52,856 --> 00:03:55,506
From the outside, the entrance

67
00:03:55,706 --> 00:03:58,996
But from the inside, there's

68
00:04:01,196 --> 00:04:03,476
We show that number

69
00:04:03,586 --> 00:04:05,346
so that you can be

70
00:04:05,346 --> 00:04:06,316
in the correct direction.

71
00:04:10,476 --> 00:04:14,796
We try to match agency signage

72
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:18,255
in terms of the signage itself,

73
00:04:18,255 --> 00:04:19,555
where and in what order.

74
00:04:19,866 --> 00:04:25,446
Again, you see that

75
00:04:29,716 --> 00:04:32,486
Finally, something that

76
00:04:32,486 --> 00:04:33,766
that the transit lines shown

77
00:04:33,766 --> 00:04:35,886
on the map follow

78
00:04:36,386 --> 00:04:40,006
Many iconic transit maps such as

79
00:04:40,006 --> 00:04:43,526
schematic, not representative of

80
00:04:44,056 --> 00:04:47,506
However, with a digital map on

81
00:04:47,506 --> 00:04:50,966
that your location position as

82
00:04:50,966 --> 00:04:52,696
up with the line you're

83
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:54,586
This builds confidence

84
00:04:54,626 --> 00:04:57,286
in the directions the

85
00:05:01,056 --> 00:05:03,536
After we've gathered all

86
00:05:03,716 --> 00:05:05,796
we go even deeper

87
00:05:06,046 --> 00:05:09,696
Our belief is that every city

88
00:05:10,016 --> 00:05:11,326
and we try to understand

89
00:05:11,326 --> 00:05:13,726
and respect this culture

90
00:05:13,726 --> 00:05:14,756
at our customers.

91
00:05:15,566 --> 00:05:16,766
In the next few slides,

92
00:05:16,766 --> 00:05:19,026
I'm going to dive

93
00:05:22,286 --> 00:05:25,286
Boarding instructions vary

94
00:05:26,286 --> 00:05:29,656
For example, in London

95
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:32,906
Whereas in New York

96
00:05:33,896 --> 00:05:36,016
You don't take the

97
00:05:36,146 --> 00:05:37,686
or the A Line in New York.

98
00:05:37,816 --> 00:05:39,236
That's not a local convention.

99
00:05:40,476 --> 00:05:42,086
Sometimes the line name matters,

100
00:05:42,266 --> 00:05:44,366
but sometimes only the

101
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:47,696
Here in the Bay Area, for

102
00:05:47,696 --> 00:05:52,226
Sometimes the local convention

103
00:05:52,396 --> 00:05:53,546
sometimes it's assumed.

104
00:05:54,026 --> 00:05:57,016
In Mexico City, we specify

105
00:05:58,216 --> 00:05:59,716
We capture these subtleties

106
00:05:59,716 --> 00:06:01,226
because that allows

107
00:05:59,716 --> 00:06:01,226
because that allows

108
00:06:01,226 --> 00:06:04,686
to match what we're telling them

109
00:06:06,996 --> 00:06:08,556
Here is a different example.

110
00:06:09,656 --> 00:06:12,196
In New York, the MTA

111
00:06:12,196 --> 00:06:13,306
in alphabetical order.

112
00:06:13,676 --> 00:06:15,236
Instead, they list

113
00:06:15,636 --> 00:06:18,476
A and C are blue,

114
00:06:21,646 --> 00:06:24,446
You see the same ordering

115
00:06:29,276 --> 00:06:32,106
Trams and street cars are

116
00:06:32,466 --> 00:06:34,286
but different cities

117
00:06:34,286 --> 00:06:35,596
to one or the other.

118
00:06:35,806 --> 00:06:38,686
For example, in Toronto,

119
00:06:38,686 --> 00:06:42,226
to board the 510 Spadina Tram,

120
00:06:42,506 --> 00:06:45,136
Everyone calls it the

121
00:06:45,616 --> 00:06:48,756
so that's what we

122
00:06:49,236 --> 00:06:55,296
In Berlin, on the other

123
00:06:59,056 --> 00:07:01,166
And that is reflected

124
00:06:59,056 --> 00:07:01,166
And that is reflected

125
00:07:01,636 --> 00:07:06,056
Here's another example.

126
00:07:06,616 --> 00:07:09,286
In San Francisco, you

127
00:07:09,776 --> 00:07:12,906
Whereas in London or Toronto,

128
00:07:12,906 --> 00:07:13,916
eastbound, and westbound.

129
00:07:14,316 --> 00:07:20,346
But in New York, you

130
00:07:20,446 --> 00:07:22,866
Again, you see this

131
00:07:25,636 --> 00:07:27,046
One final example.

132
00:07:27,246 --> 00:07:30,486
In Rio, the bus rapid transit

133
00:07:31,056 --> 00:07:33,296
In many ways, they are

134
00:07:33,296 --> 00:07:34,546
and commuter rail systems.

135
00:07:35,016 --> 00:07:37,716
We raise the prominence of

136
00:07:37,716 --> 00:07:40,076
on our map to reflect

137
00:07:40,586 --> 00:07:43,466
That's the blue and orange lines

138
00:07:43,466 --> 00:07:45,176
that you see in this

139
00:07:48,656 --> 00:07:50,556
Here is how we build

140
00:07:51,296 --> 00:07:55,266
We start with agency data for

141
00:07:55,326 --> 00:07:57,096
to add additional curated data.

142
00:07:57,276 --> 00:07:59,626
For example, station

143
00:07:59,626 --> 00:08:00,766
as we've previously seen.

144
00:07:59,626 --> 00:08:00,766
as we've previously seen.

145
00:08:01,836 --> 00:08:03,366
Then we customize the experience

146
00:08:03,366 --> 00:08:05,806
to respect the unique

147
00:08:06,576 --> 00:08:09,576
Finally, this is all

148
00:08:09,866 --> 00:08:11,696
to bring delight

149
00:08:15,596 --> 00:08:16,976
Now, I'd like to give

150
00:08:25,106 --> 00:08:28,136
Let's say you just flew into San

151
00:08:28,326 --> 00:08:31,486
and you'd like directions

152
00:08:32,395 --> 00:08:34,936
First, you can see our

153
00:08:35,326 --> 00:08:38,336
As I mentioned, transit lines

154
00:08:38,336 --> 00:08:38,885
are dimmed.

155
00:08:39,486 --> 00:08:43,166
Now, we're going to

156
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:44,376
for Powell Street Station.

157
00:08:45,086 --> 00:08:48,056
Powell Street is serviced

158
00:08:48,056 --> 00:08:50,416
and you can see the upcoming

159
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:51,896
as the upcoming Muni departures.

160
00:09:00,086 --> 00:09:02,446
Now, at the top I noticed

161
00:09:03,496 --> 00:09:04,556
When I tap on details,

162
00:09:04,556 --> 00:09:07,366
I see that Muni has some

163
00:09:07,366 --> 00:09:09,476
and we are communicating

164
00:09:09,476 --> 00:09:10,386
to our customers.

165
00:09:17,836 --> 00:09:20,596
You can zoom out to see

166
00:09:20,596 --> 00:09:20,976
of the Bay Area.

167
00:09:29,506 --> 00:09:32,036
Or you can zoom in

168
00:09:35,336 --> 00:09:37,896
The information density

169
00:09:37,896 --> 00:09:40,046
that we show changes

170
00:09:40,796 --> 00:09:43,756
Now, some people may want

171
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,156
So, for example,

172
00:09:46,156 --> 00:09:47,556
if a bus route is available.

173
00:09:48,096 --> 00:09:52,636
In our product, you can select

174
00:09:52,636 --> 00:09:53,806
like to use for your journey.

175
00:09:54,846 --> 00:09:56,856
Here is a competing bus route.

176
00:09:57,916 --> 00:09:59,986
Now, we didn't recommend

177
00:10:00,486 --> 00:10:03,986
But it's an option

178
00:10:04,696 --> 00:10:08,536
So let's go back to our

179
00:10:08,536 --> 00:10:09,716
that in greater detail.

180
00:10:13,776 --> 00:10:16,726
The route planner tells you when

181
00:10:16,726 --> 00:10:17,946
and gives a summary

182
00:10:18,386 --> 00:10:20,636
Tapping on this, I get

183
00:10:21,256 --> 00:10:23,266
A detailed list of

184
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:26,736
I can expand the list

185
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:33,106
Now, when I select start,

186
00:10:33,106 --> 00:10:34,416
with detailed instructions.

187
00:10:34,746 --> 00:10:36,056
Since I'm already

188
00:10:36,096 --> 00:10:37,656
it just tells me

189
00:10:38,366 --> 00:10:41,346
Tells me to exit at Powell, and

190
00:10:41,866 --> 00:10:44,896
Here you can see we're

191
00:10:44,896 --> 00:10:49,946
exit with an exit code, E3,

192
00:10:52,256 --> 00:10:54,616
