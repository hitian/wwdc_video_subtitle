00:00:19,606 --> 00:00:21,376
&gt;&gt; Hi. I'm Todd Ritland,

3
00:00:21,786 --> 00:00:23,606
and the lead engineer

4
00:00:24,646 --> 00:00:27,166
And this is Deploying

5
00:00:30,296 --> 00:00:32,356
AirPrint is Apple's

6
00:00:32,976 --> 00:00:34,556
It's a technology that helps you

7
00:00:34,556 --> 00:00:37,476
to create full-quality

8
00:00:37,476 --> 00:00:39,236
to download or install drivers.

9
00:00:40,546 --> 00:00:42,516
If you're an app developer

10
00:00:42,516 --> 00:00:46,426
to your app, see

11
00:00:46,516 --> 00:00:51,106
for a previous talk I gave at

12
00:00:51,806 --> 00:00:53,566
and download the sample

13
00:00:54,806 --> 00:00:56,326
If you are a printer

14
00:00:56,666 --> 00:00:58,566
or a print server

15
00:00:58,566 --> 00:01:00,726
to license AirPrint

16
00:00:58,566 --> 00:01:00,726
to license AirPrint

17
00:01:01,506 --> 00:01:03,766
please email airprint@apple.com.

18
00:01:05,325 --> 00:01:07,636
This talk will focus on

19
00:01:07,636 --> 00:01:09,516
for deploying AirPrint

20
00:01:09,516 --> 00:01:11,056
about all the enterprise

21
00:01:11,216 --> 00:01:13,616
that make AirPrint work great

22
00:01:16,426 --> 00:01:18,626
Printing in enterprise has

23
00:01:19,206 --> 00:01:22,026
Our enterprise customers

24
00:01:22,026 --> 00:01:24,226
of printers, often

25
00:01:24,226 --> 00:01:27,376
and with different features,

26
00:01:27,376 --> 00:01:28,926
or across many different

27
00:01:29,436 --> 00:01:30,536
and in many locations.

28
00:01:31,666 --> 00:01:33,716
These can be hugely

29
00:01:35,786 --> 00:01:38,316
The network infrastructure

30
00:01:39,576 --> 00:01:41,756
Often they're wireless

31
00:01:42,616 --> 00:01:45,076
and their network

32
00:01:45,076 --> 00:01:46,806
to the physical location

33
00:01:48,936 --> 00:01:51,706
IT departments also have

34
00:01:51,706 --> 00:01:53,756
such as no access

35
00:01:54,296 --> 00:01:56,286
no multicast packet

36
00:01:56,816 --> 00:02:00,366
and certain ports blocks, which

37
00:01:56,816 --> 00:02:00,366
and certain ports blocks, which

38
00:02:01,616 --> 00:02:04,596
Enterprise customers also may

39
00:02:05,046 --> 00:02:06,906
since every page

40
00:02:08,466 --> 00:02:12,436
And of course security

41
00:02:12,436 --> 00:02:14,516
and are increasingly important

42
00:02:18,046 --> 00:02:22,446
The top requests we get from

43
00:02:22,446 --> 00:02:27,276
to create PDF and have more

44
00:02:27,986 --> 00:02:29,436
access control and accounting,

45
00:02:30,376 --> 00:02:31,806
and better discovery

46
00:02:33,036 --> 00:02:34,596
So let's go into

47
00:02:34,596 --> 00:02:35,836
for each of these in detail.

48
00:02:38,236 --> 00:02:40,386
First, create PDF

49
00:02:41,896 --> 00:02:43,646
Mac OS has long had the ability

50
00:02:43,646 --> 00:02:46,056
to get a PDF anywhere

51
00:02:46,896 --> 00:02:49,666
And now in iOS 10, all iOS

52
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:50,976
as well and I'd like to

53
00:02:56,116 --> 00:03:00,716
Here we have an iPad running

54
00:02:56,116 --> 00:03:00,716
Here we have an iPad running

55
00:03:01,626 --> 00:03:04,576
I just pinch out with my two

56
00:03:07,746 --> 00:03:09,976
And from here, I have a Share

57
00:03:11,966 --> 00:03:14,756
Any app can accept PDFs will

58
00:03:14,876 --> 00:03:17,486
as well as AirDrop and other

59
00:03:18,746 --> 00:03:22,166
This also works with the Managed

60
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:24,736
that keeps business items

61
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:29,966
On devices with 3D Touch, you

62
00:03:29,966 --> 00:03:32,776
and Pop gesture to

63
00:03:32,776 --> 00:03:33,696
from the Print Preview.

64
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:37,586
We think enterprise users will

65
00:03:37,586 --> 00:03:40,206
workflow on all of

66
00:03:43,406 --> 00:03:46,496
Next onto a hugely

67
00:03:49,356 --> 00:03:52,546
AirPrint on iOS and Mac

68
00:03:52,546 --> 00:03:55,126
encryption so your documents

69
00:03:56,986 --> 00:04:00,386
AirPrint supports the latest

70
00:03:56,986 --> 00:04:00,386
AirPrint supports the latest

71
00:04:00,386 --> 00:04:02,206
encryption on top of HTTP.

72
00:04:03,726 --> 00:04:06,066
This encryption technology

73
00:04:06,066 --> 00:04:08,206
for all new AirPrint

74
00:04:11,516 --> 00:04:13,366
Next, for additional security,

75
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:16,565
many enterprise customers don't

76
00:04:16,565 --> 00:04:18,156
around in the output

77
00:04:18,776 --> 00:04:23,496
where an unauthorized person

78
00:04:23,496 --> 00:04:26,516
iOS and Mac OS support PIN

79
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:30,316
that support it, where the user

80
00:04:30,556 --> 00:04:31,606
to receive their output.

81
00:04:33,526 --> 00:04:35,576
On iOS, when a PIN is required,

82
00:04:36,496 --> 00:04:38,686
the Print panel has a

83
00:04:38,686 --> 00:04:42,896
And when the user taps

84
00:04:42,896 --> 00:04:43,976
with the PIN to release the job.

85
00:04:49,896 --> 00:04:53,646
On Mac OS, the user can

86
00:04:53,646 --> 00:04:55,726
to use to release the job.

87
00:04:55,936 --> 00:04:59,496
Mac OS also supports

88
00:04:59,496 --> 00:05:00,706
and not required to print.

89
00:04:59,496 --> 00:05:00,706
and not required to print.

90
00:05:01,496 --> 00:05:03,506
Next, Access Control

91
00:05:05,456 --> 00:05:07,726
AirPrint has always

92
00:05:07,726 --> 00:05:10,446
that require authentication

93
00:05:11,846 --> 00:05:14,456
We store the username and

94
00:05:14,896 --> 00:05:16,616
so the user never has

95
00:05:17,896 --> 00:05:20,836
iOS 10 now supports

96
00:05:20,836 --> 00:05:23,876
that stored authentication

97
00:05:23,876 --> 00:05:24,976
where a different

98
00:05:30,646 --> 00:05:33,836
Also new this year is support

99
00:05:33,836 --> 00:05:35,246
so printer can be protected

100
00:05:35,246 --> 00:05:36,976
with just a simple

101
00:05:41,896 --> 00:05:43,756
When an enterprise

102
00:05:43,946 --> 00:05:46,736
or account information

103
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:50,596
iOS and Mac OS both support

104
00:05:50,596 --> 00:05:51,776
that account information.

105
00:05:52,446 --> 00:05:55,456
If the account information

106
00:05:56,076 --> 00:05:57,676
the user will be

107
00:05:57,676 --> 00:05:58,946
that information before

108
00:06:04,056 --> 00:06:06,816
And iOS and Mac OS

109
00:06:06,816 --> 00:06:09,186
or required account

110
00:06:09,706 --> 00:06:10,976
and this is what the UI

111
00:06:18,556 --> 00:06:19,886
Next, Better Discovery.

112
00:06:22,786 --> 00:06:25,426
AirPrint has many supportive

113
00:06:25,946 --> 00:06:27,926
The main method which

114
00:06:27,926 --> 00:06:29,586
with AirPrint is Local Bonjour.

115
00:06:30,786 --> 00:06:31,976
There is no setup required.

116
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:35,056
The printer automatically

117
00:06:35,056 --> 00:06:36,336
in the list without any setup.

118
00:06:38,536 --> 00:06:41,516
AirPrint has also always

119
00:06:42,656 --> 00:06:45,546
Bonjour is based on

120
00:06:45,966 --> 00:06:47,556
And if a DNS server

121
00:06:47,556 --> 00:06:48,636
with the correct records,

122
00:06:49,476 --> 00:06:50,946
printers can be discovered

123
00:06:51,386 --> 00:06:52,616
and I'll go over how to do this.

124
00:06:53,586 --> 00:06:58,526
Both iOS and Mac OS also now

125
00:06:58,526 --> 00:07:01,836
or MDM profiles with a

126
00:06:58,526 --> 00:07:01,836
or MDM profiles with a

127
00:07:03,996 --> 00:07:07,816
And new in iOS 10, we have

128
00:07:07,816 --> 00:07:09,976
as a way to discover

129
00:07:09,976 --> 00:07:11,796
low-energy beacons.

130
00:07:15,116 --> 00:07:16,336
Configuring a DNS server

131
00:07:16,336 --> 00:07:18,176
to advertise AirPrint

132
00:07:19,046 --> 00:07:22,516
First, the configured DNS

133
00:07:22,516 --> 00:07:24,956
of DNS servers used

134
00:07:24,956 --> 00:07:26,566
and Macs you want

135
00:07:27,146 --> 00:07:30,186
There are lots of ways to

136
00:07:30,186 --> 00:07:34,686
and search domains are used,

137
00:07:35,266 --> 00:07:41,446
And next you want to add A

138
00:07:41,446 --> 00:07:44,876
of the printer and the printer

139
00:07:46,936 --> 00:07:50,066
Add a PTR record for the

140
00:07:50,066 --> 00:07:53,136
and one additional PTR record

141
00:07:54,106 --> 00:07:57,046
This is key for AirPrint

142
00:07:57,046 --> 00:07:57,916
IPPS service.

143
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:00,316
It has a subtype of universal

144
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:00,316
It has a subtype of universal

145
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:03,126
and that's what iOS

146
00:08:04,546 --> 00:08:09,526
You'll add a SRV record for

147
00:08:09,526 --> 00:08:12,406
or text record that

148
00:08:12,406 --> 00:08:13,556
and information about

149
00:08:14,936 --> 00:08:18,336
It's super important to

150
00:08:18,336 --> 00:08:19,426
of the printer or server,

151
00:08:19,926 --> 00:08:22,626
which can easily be accomplished

152
00:08:22,626 --> 00:08:24,116
OS, dns-sd.

153
00:08:24,116 --> 00:08:30,796
To use dns-sd to figure out the

154
00:08:30,796 --> 00:08:33,006
on the same subnet as the

155
00:08:33,936 --> 00:08:37,076
You run with the -Z option

156
00:08:37,076 --> 00:08:41,405
in zone file format and

157
00:08:41,405 --> 00:08:45,916
underscore ipps.service

158
00:08:46,226 --> 00:08:47,256
like shown here in blue.

159
00:08:49,606 --> 00:08:50,806
This is the output you'll get

160
00:08:50,806 --> 00:08:52,676
for each printer that's

161
00:08:53,996 --> 00:08:58,176
These are almost the PTR, SRV,

162
00:08:58,176 --> 00:09:00,996
to add to DNS server

163
00:08:58,176 --> 00:09:00,996
to add to DNS server

164
00:09:03,546 --> 00:09:05,246
The changes are highlighted

165
00:09:05,716 --> 00:09:08,456
As I mentioned, you'll add

166
00:09:08,456 --> 00:09:11,836
for the universal subtype, like

167
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:16,086
You'll also replace the local

168
00:09:16,366 --> 00:09:18,116
with the fully-qualified

169
00:09:18,956 --> 00:09:22,326
the A record I mentioned

170
00:09:22,326 --> 00:09:25,296
to replace any other instances

171
00:09:25,296 --> 00:09:28,706
with this fully-qualified domain

172
00:09:28,706 --> 00:09:31,026
in green, with the

173
00:09:32,966 --> 00:09:35,846
If this isn't fixed, users

174
00:09:35,846 --> 00:09:38,116
in Mac OS that quickly

175
00:09:38,116 --> 00:09:39,786
to the printer's admin webpage.

176
00:09:41,286 --> 00:09:43,766
And so this is the text here

177
00:09:43,766 --> 00:09:46,616
into a zone file and a

178
00:09:46,616 --> 00:09:47,836
of printers for your users,

179
00:09:47,836 --> 00:09:50,056
if they have this

180
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:51,816
as one of their DNS servers.

181
00:09:52,456 --> 00:09:55,166
So the key to setting up

182
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:58,246
to get some help from the

183
00:10:01,696 --> 00:10:04,796
MDM profiles are very

184
00:10:04,796 --> 00:10:06,376
to configure printers

185
00:10:07,506 --> 00:10:09,736
The AirPrint payload can

186
00:10:09,996 --> 00:10:12,016
and that payload

187
00:10:12,016 --> 00:10:14,336
or IP address and

188
00:10:15,866 --> 00:10:20,036
The resource path is ipp/print

189
00:10:20,896 --> 00:10:22,866
and for an AirPrint server,

190
00:10:24,616 --> 00:10:27,846
And the screenshot shown

191
00:10:28,286 --> 00:10:31,016
one of the most popular Mobile

192
00:10:31,286 --> 00:10:35,746
Next we have a new

193
00:10:35,746 --> 00:10:37,306
about that's new in iOS 10

194
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:39,266
and that's the AirPrint

195
00:10:42,046 --> 00:10:44,766
So what is an AirPrint Bluetooth

196
00:10:46,046 --> 00:10:47,476
Well, it can be configured

197
00:10:47,476 --> 00:10:49,936
of the many third-party

198
00:10:49,936 --> 00:10:53,806
available on the market and

199
00:10:54,746 --> 00:10:57,116
or can it be built into the

200
00:10:57,116 --> 00:10:59,036
printer's built-in

201
00:10:59,546 --> 00:11:02,226
And future AirPrint printers

202
00:10:59,546 --> 00:11:02,226
And future AirPrint printers

203
00:11:02,226 --> 00:11:03,986
right in.

204
00:11:04,906 --> 00:11:07,336
What it does is beacon out

205
00:11:08,026 --> 00:11:11,546
And if the iPhone can

206
00:11:11,886 --> 00:11:14,686
the printer will be

207
00:11:15,826 --> 00:11:18,436
This is really powerful

208
00:11:18,436 --> 00:11:19,096
don't matter.

209
00:11:19,156 --> 00:11:21,666
All that matters is that

210
00:11:22,926 --> 00:11:25,146
This could even be a public

211
00:11:25,686 --> 00:11:28,206
So long as the iOS device

212
00:11:28,366 --> 00:11:30,206
and the IP address

213
00:11:30,206 --> 00:11:31,836
the printer will show up

214
00:11:31,836 --> 00:11:32,996
on the list for users.

215
00:11:35,286 --> 00:11:38,546
And the AirPrint Beacon works

216
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:44,046
Here we have an AirPrint server

217
00:11:44,046 --> 00:11:46,266
on the network has an

218
00:11:46,636 --> 00:11:49,076
which is advertising

219
00:11:49,546 --> 00:11:51,616
and the Queue ID

220
00:11:52,616 --> 00:11:56,726
When the user prints, the

221
00:11:57,696 --> 00:12:02,716
with the queue information, and

222
00:11:57,696 --> 00:12:02,716
with the queue information, and

223
00:12:02,786 --> 00:12:05,496
to the associated printer that

224
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:11,816
Let's go into detail about what

225
00:12:11,816 --> 00:12:14,356
format is so you can set

226
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:18,316
First, we have a header.

227
00:12:19,046 --> 00:12:23,516
This is what identifies this BLE

228
00:12:24,696 --> 00:12:27,046
It's the same for all

229
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:28,306
so this can just be copied.

230
00:12:29,756 --> 00:12:32,486
Next, we have the

231
00:12:33,006 --> 00:12:35,036
This tells whether the

232
00:12:35,036 --> 00:12:38,586
in the beacon is an IPv4

233
00:12:39,506 --> 00:12:42,216
It also tells whether the

234
00:12:42,216 --> 00:12:44,836
or identifies a printer

235
00:12:44,836 --> 00:12:47,026
if the connection

236
00:12:47,656 --> 00:12:51,006
For this example, the

237
00:12:51,046 --> 00:12:54,186
the IP address is

238
00:12:54,706 --> 00:12:55,816
and this is not a server.

239
00:12:57,496 --> 00:13:00,786
See the specification

240
00:12:57,496 --> 00:13:00,786
See the specification

241
00:13:01,486 --> 00:13:02,646
for how this byte is set up.

242
00:13:05,696 --> 00:13:07,976
Next we have a printer

243
00:13:07,976 --> 00:13:11,896
to a print server or information

244
00:13:11,896 --> 00:13:13,266
if this is directly

245
00:13:14,936 --> 00:13:18,156
This printer has ipp/print

246
00:13:19,356 --> 00:13:22,936
Again, see the specification

247
00:13:22,936 --> 00:13:25,356
about specifying resource paths.

248
00:13:28,076 --> 00:13:29,906
Next we have the port

249
00:13:30,946 --> 00:13:33,536
631 is the standard IPP port.

250
00:13:34,176 --> 00:13:37,736
Port 443 is often used for

251
00:13:38,376 --> 00:13:43,456
For this example, 277

252
00:13:43,456 --> 00:13:45,466
which is the standard IPP port.

253
00:13:47,886 --> 00:13:50,186
And next we have the IP address.

254
00:13:50,676 --> 00:13:55,326
If you're using a non-updatable

255
00:13:55,746 --> 00:13:57,716
make sure the printer

256
00:13:58,396 --> 00:14:01,036
Otherwise, this IP in the

257
00:13:58,396 --> 00:14:01,036
Otherwise, this IP in the

258
00:14:01,036 --> 00:14:02,486
when the IP address changes.

259
00:14:05,446 --> 00:14:09,276
And last, like iBeacon, we have

260
00:14:09,276 --> 00:14:10,076
at 1 meter.

261
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:14,536
This uses the same methodology

262
00:14:15,256 --> 00:14:17,606
This gives the iOS

263
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:19,216
about the physical

264
00:14:20,266 --> 00:14:23,536
For this example, the

265
00:14:23,536 --> 00:14:27,666
to be on average 64 decibels,

266
00:14:30,016 --> 00:14:32,106
The format of the AirPrint

267
00:14:32,106 --> 00:14:33,116
similar to iBeacon.

268
00:14:35,496 --> 00:14:37,406
iBeacon format is

269
00:14:37,926 --> 00:14:39,556
but the beginning

270
00:14:41,236 --> 00:14:43,396
If you're following setup

271
00:14:43,396 --> 00:14:46,636
with iBeacon technology,

272
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:49,436
and use a similar setup for

273
00:14:50,516 --> 00:14:54,036
and many manufacturers of

274
00:14:54,036 --> 00:14:56,406
or will have specific

275
00:14:56,406 --> 00:14:57,536
setup procedures.

276
00:15:00,016 --> 00:15:02,016
So for enterprise users, iOS

277
00:15:02,016 --> 00:15:04,286
and Mac OS provides

278
00:15:04,286 --> 00:15:07,576
to support PDF workflows for

279
00:15:07,876 --> 00:15:11,856
And AirPrint provides great

280
00:15:11,956 --> 00:15:14,486
accounting, and new

281
00:15:14,486 --> 00:15:16,456
to make printing great

282
00:15:17,796 --> 00:15:19,736
And as always, let

283
00:15:19,736 --> 00:15:22,556
about what specific enterprise

284
00:15:22,556 --> 00:15:24,386
