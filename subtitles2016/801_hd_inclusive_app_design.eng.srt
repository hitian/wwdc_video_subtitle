3
00:00:27,446 --> 00:00:31,176
&gt;&gt; Hi, I'm Caroline

4
00:00:31,176 --> 00:00:33,276
and production manager

5
00:00:33,936 --> 00:00:37,546
Today, I'm excited to talk

6
00:00:37,836 --> 00:00:39,446
about inclusive design.

7
00:00:39,976 --> 00:00:43,776
When you put so much hard work

8
00:00:44,186 --> 00:00:46,576
you really want it

9
00:00:47,226 --> 00:00:50,586
But ultimately, everyone

10
00:00:50,906 --> 00:00:54,466
in their own way and if you

11
00:00:54,466 --> 00:00:56,666
of people who could

12
00:00:56,966 --> 00:00:59,956
you have to consider how

13
00:01:01,506 --> 00:01:05,176
Some people are just learning

14
00:01:07,126 --> 00:01:10,946
Others are digital natives

15
00:01:11,226 --> 00:01:12,846
with the latest and greatest.

16
00:01:13,276 --> 00:01:16,906
And there's some who are just

17
00:01:16,906 --> 00:01:18,466
with the new way to communicate.

18
00:01:19,986 --> 00:01:22,466
And some will have

19
00:01:22,466 --> 00:01:24,136
that are very different

20
00:01:24,646 --> 00:01:28,946
And some will interact with your

21
00:01:29,176 --> 00:01:30,946
like a Bluetooth

22
00:01:32,326 --> 00:01:35,516
So when you're trying to

23
00:01:35,516 --> 00:01:38,786
like there isn't enough time and

24
00:01:38,966 --> 00:01:41,856
and it only gets worse the

25
00:01:42,416 --> 00:01:45,726
So that's why it's important to

26
00:01:46,056 --> 00:01:48,656
as early as possible in

27
00:01:49,486 --> 00:01:52,896
The problem is that early in

28
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:55,506
to talk about the cool

29
00:01:56,096 --> 00:01:59,106
So you need to convince your

30
00:01:59,386 --> 00:02:02,796
And here are some statistics

31
00:01:59,386 --> 00:02:02,796
And here are some statistics

32
00:02:03,006 --> 00:02:05,736
to make inclusiveness

33
00:02:06,836 --> 00:02:11,606
Tim Cook recently announced

34
00:02:11,856 --> 00:02:13,906
in the second quarter

35
00:02:14,446 --> 00:02:17,166
Your app needs to be

36
00:02:17,166 --> 00:02:21,026
to reach this huge market of

37
00:02:22,436 --> 00:02:29,046
Worldwide, 285 million people

38
00:02:29,496 --> 00:02:32,076
That's like half the

39
00:02:33,716 --> 00:02:38,556
Over one billion people live

40
00:02:39,086 --> 00:02:42,256
That's one out of every

41
00:02:43,266 --> 00:02:46,916
Now disability and diversity

42
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:49,616
think about when you think

43
00:02:50,106 --> 00:02:53,196
But these numbers make it

44
00:02:53,246 --> 00:02:57,396
that use your app and creating

45
00:02:57,396 --> 00:02:59,506
at the heart of the

46
00:03:00,646 --> 00:03:04,286
So, how can you make

47
00:03:04,876 --> 00:03:08,376
Fortunately, there are a

48
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:10,316
that I have found to be helpful.

49
00:03:11,606 --> 00:03:14,286
If you incorporate these

50
00:03:14,656 --> 00:03:17,556
you will have more informed

51
00:03:17,976 --> 00:03:21,216
And in the end, your app

52
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:24,096
for more people, but

53
00:03:24,096 --> 00:03:25,456
on localization and QA.

54
00:03:26,576 --> 00:03:29,086
So today, I'm going

55
00:03:29,086 --> 00:03:32,366
that I found eye opening and now

56
00:03:33,356 --> 00:03:36,616
I'll discuss how to use

57
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:38,076
in different localizations.

58
00:03:38,896 --> 00:03:42,016
I'll show you why layouts

59
00:03:42,276 --> 00:03:44,006
to accommodate translation

60
00:03:44,176 --> 00:03:46,216
screen sizes and dynamic type.

61
00:03:46,216 --> 00:03:50,996
And we'll discuss emotions

62
00:03:51,246 --> 00:03:53,076
when making design

63
00:03:54,116 --> 00:03:56,986
And we'll go over certain

64
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:57,966
around iconography.

65
00:04:04,376 --> 00:04:08,386
So first, we'll talk about

66
00:04:08,386 --> 00:04:10,806
for everyone regardless

67
00:04:11,426 --> 00:04:14,846
Because the most fundamental

68
00:04:14,846 --> 00:04:16,786
to communicate information

69
00:04:16,956 --> 00:04:19,106
and we largely do

70
00:04:19,736 --> 00:04:22,576
So let's look at a quick

71
00:04:23,326 --> 00:04:27,276
One of the ways you know

72
00:04:27,276 --> 00:04:29,546
by using basic typographic

73
00:04:29,706 --> 00:04:33,106
and compositional elements to

74
00:04:33,966 --> 00:04:37,486
You can use extra space between

75
00:04:38,836 --> 00:04:40,726
or try different font sizes.

76
00:04:42,276 --> 00:04:45,636
Or you can explore typographic

77
00:04:46,726 --> 00:04:51,176
or character styles like

78
00:04:51,886 --> 00:04:55,546
Or start adding color

79
00:04:55,546 --> 00:04:57,236
you have so many good options.

80
00:04:57,626 --> 00:05:00,736
And at this stage, it's

81
00:04:57,626 --> 00:05:00,736
And at this stage, it's

82
00:05:00,976 --> 00:05:05,156
to preview your favorite options

83
00:05:05,156 --> 00:05:08,276
to localize in because

84
00:05:08,276 --> 00:05:11,326
to have this same impact

85
00:05:12,276 --> 00:05:15,546
In this example, the hierarchy

86
00:05:15,546 --> 00:05:17,976
and subtitle of the

87
00:05:18,216 --> 00:05:21,346
because the Chinese writing

88
00:05:21,516 --> 00:05:22,796
of upper and lowercase.

89
00:05:23,036 --> 00:05:28,606
In the second design, the title

90
00:05:28,606 --> 00:05:30,836
size and color from the subtitle

91
00:05:31,076 --> 00:05:33,696
which helps maintain a

92
00:05:34,226 --> 00:05:36,536
So out of my two favorites,

93
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:39,856
this second design is

94
00:05:40,116 --> 00:05:41,456
because it creates hierarchy

95
00:05:41,456 --> 00:05:43,626
through using two

96
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:47,466
both localizations can support,

97
00:05:47,886 --> 00:05:51,556
I've found that once a design

98
00:05:51,556 --> 00:05:54,716
into multiple languages,

99
00:05:54,716 --> 00:05:57,286
of change will be

100
00:05:57,286 --> 00:06:00,216
in case a treatment isn't

101
00:05:57,286 --> 00:06:00,216
in case a treatment isn't

102
00:06:01,036 --> 00:06:03,396
And sometimes, designing

103
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:06,166
like these can help come up

104
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:06,876
for everyone.

105
00:06:08,156 --> 00:06:10,156
Here's another example

106
00:06:10,156 --> 00:06:15,006
They use font size, color, and

107
00:06:15,236 --> 00:06:17,806
to maintain hierarchy

108
00:06:18,306 --> 00:06:22,766
And so now for you to have

109
00:06:22,766 --> 00:06:25,436
and feel informed to

110
00:06:25,436 --> 00:06:29,086
I want to dive a little

111
00:06:30,506 --> 00:06:33,466
First, it's important to

112
00:06:33,506 --> 00:06:36,616
we speak different languages

113
00:06:37,096 --> 00:06:39,826
So, I want to introduce

114
00:06:39,906 --> 00:06:41,436
that you may not

115
00:06:41,896 --> 00:06:44,946
and how hierarchy can be

116
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:46,116
of their typographic support.

117
00:06:47,396 --> 00:06:50,486
So everyone here knows this

118
00:06:51,356 --> 00:06:53,286
But you may not be

119
00:06:53,286 --> 00:06:56,056
in the extended Latin

120
00:06:56,506 --> 00:06:58,716
And you really might

121
00:06:58,986 --> 00:07:01,476
with all ten writing

122
00:06:58,986 --> 00:07:01,476
with all ten writing

123
00:07:01,476 --> 00:07:04,906
in over forty languages or

124
00:07:05,386 --> 00:07:09,786
A few typographic things that

125
00:07:09,786 --> 00:07:12,846
that some writing systems do

126
00:07:12,936 --> 00:07:14,726
and lowercase as I

127
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:20,176
Also, the same subset does

128
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:23,306
and it's not in good

129
00:07:23,306 --> 00:07:24,576
on these writing systems.

130
00:07:26,176 --> 00:07:29,396
So now you need to know

131
00:07:29,426 --> 00:07:32,306
for these writing systems

132
00:07:32,306 --> 00:07:33,286
of font weights.

133
00:07:34,826 --> 00:07:36,606
Currently these are

134
00:07:36,606 --> 00:07:39,256
in the system font,

135
00:07:39,256 --> 00:07:43,616
But you can see that the system

136
00:07:43,616 --> 00:07:46,826
at the moment do not have the

137
00:07:47,836 --> 00:07:52,156
So this means your designs using

138
00:07:52,156 --> 00:07:52,966
to the reduced set.

139
00:07:52,966 --> 00:07:55,336
And this can be unexpected

140
00:07:55,336 --> 00:07:57,496
and sometimes lose

141
00:07:57,706 --> 00:08:01,506
In the next consideration,

142
00:07:57,706 --> 00:08:01,506
In the next consideration,

143
00:08:01,506 --> 00:08:05,306
about is using larger text sizes

144
00:08:05,306 --> 00:08:07,776
between languages and

145
00:08:08,396 --> 00:08:09,646
So let's start with

146
00:08:09,646 --> 00:08:11,056
which is, "What is too small?"

147
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:15,516
Maybe everyone here can

148
00:08:15,516 --> 00:08:16,656
on this enormous screen.

149
00:08:16,986 --> 00:08:19,996
But on a smaller device,

150
00:08:20,646 --> 00:08:22,766
Legibility is really

151
00:08:22,766 --> 00:08:24,586
on what device you are targeting

152
00:08:24,866 --> 00:08:27,246
because the standard viewing

153
00:08:27,936 --> 00:08:30,676
But, even if the

154
00:08:30,816 --> 00:08:33,716
it doesn't mean it's going to

155
00:08:34,546 --> 00:08:37,366
Let's look at a non-Latin

156
00:08:38,785 --> 00:08:41,535
It gets harder to read

157
00:08:41,655 --> 00:08:45,816
because rendering dense writing

158
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:47,156
clarity of letter forms.

159
00:08:47,686 --> 00:08:50,236
The meaning can be

160
00:08:50,236 --> 00:08:51,856
because the strokes

161
00:08:52,436 --> 00:08:57,156
You want people to read their

162
00:08:57,596 --> 00:09:01,206
So leaning toward larger font

163
00:08:57,596 --> 00:09:01,206
So leaning toward larger font

164
00:09:01,206 --> 00:09:02,346
readable for everyone.

165
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:06,516
Now one more thing

166
00:09:07,126 --> 00:09:10,386
Some writing systems are

167
00:09:10,626 --> 00:09:12,616
because they have

168
00:09:14,116 --> 00:09:16,736
As you might have noticed in

169
00:09:16,736 --> 00:09:19,586
some of the examples

170
00:09:19,636 --> 00:09:20,936
that we don't use in English.

171
00:09:21,356 --> 00:09:24,646
These are call diacritics,

172
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:27,406
and sometimes they're

173
00:09:28,376 --> 00:09:31,956
For example, in this Thai font

174
00:09:32,036 --> 00:09:33,616
higher than Latin characters.

175
00:09:35,476 --> 00:09:37,986
And in these Arabic

176
00:09:38,236 --> 00:09:41,426
they have descenders much

177
00:09:43,146 --> 00:09:45,046
And you should also be aware

178
00:09:45,276 --> 00:09:47,416
that in some code

179
00:09:47,736 --> 00:09:50,566
characters that draw

180
00:09:50,566 --> 00:09:52,876
and descender boundaries

181
00:09:52,876 --> 00:09:55,456
and text views can

182
00:09:55,486 --> 00:09:57,316
to bounds is true for the label.

183
00:09:57,616 --> 00:10:00,976
This should be off,

184
00:09:57,616 --> 00:10:00,976
This should be off,

185
00:10:01,586 --> 00:10:04,916
Missing marks can change the

186
00:10:06,276 --> 00:10:08,736
So, also in design comps,

187
00:10:08,736 --> 00:10:11,646
you should avoid assuming

188
00:10:11,946 --> 00:10:13,956
because the letter

189
00:10:13,956 --> 00:10:15,136
in different writing systems.

190
00:10:16,446 --> 00:10:19,386
So you might be thinking how

191
00:10:19,636 --> 00:10:21,226
So let me show you

192
00:10:21,226 --> 00:10:23,496
of how labels will

193
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:25,676
for these tall writing

194
00:10:27,276 --> 00:10:29,306
If you look at this

195
00:10:29,306 --> 00:10:32,326
of three separate

196
00:10:32,846 --> 00:10:35,756
and you can see in a tall

197
00:10:35,756 --> 00:10:38,096
larger line height

198
00:10:38,726 --> 00:10:40,236
And here they are, side by side.

199
00:10:40,466 --> 00:10:44,536
And you can see that Thai text

200
00:10:44,536 --> 00:10:45,916
to expand appropriately.

201
00:10:46,316 --> 00:10:49,546
And it's important that you

202
00:10:49,546 --> 00:10:52,066
of the view so this

203
00:10:52,536 --> 00:10:55,406
because letter forms could

204
00:10:55,956 --> 00:10:58,966
And later, we'll explain how to

205
00:10:58,966 --> 00:11:01,346
between labels increase

206
00:10:58,966 --> 00:11:01,346
between labels increase

207
00:11:01,346 --> 00:11:02,836
to accommodate dynamic type.

208
00:11:04,026 --> 00:11:07,956
So some things to remember

209
00:11:07,956 --> 00:11:11,996
to make sure designs will retain

210
00:11:11,996 --> 00:11:14,786
in other languages by

211
00:11:15,086 --> 00:11:18,756
by choosing universal character

212
00:11:18,756 --> 00:11:22,026
to three levels of change

213
00:11:22,026 --> 00:11:23,306
in one of the localizations.

214
00:11:25,116 --> 00:11:28,366
Use font sizes that will

215
00:11:28,366 --> 00:11:31,686
of your localizations and

216
00:11:31,686 --> 00:11:34,006
who will use your app.

217
00:11:34,006 --> 00:11:37,636
And don't restrict drawing of

218
00:11:38,446 --> 00:11:40,866
So now we've looked at a

219
00:11:41,096 --> 00:11:44,316
For more information about

220
00:11:44,316 --> 00:11:47,266
out my friend Antonio's

221
00:11:47,266 --> 00:11:49,966
Typography and Fonts

222
00:11:49,966 --> 00:11:52,626
on typographic treatments

223
00:11:53,726 --> 00:11:55,696
But now, let's talk

224
00:11:56,396 --> 00:12:01,506
We've talked about the

225
00:11:56,396 --> 00:12:01,506
We've talked about the

226
00:12:01,506 --> 00:12:02,996
over the world, but

227
00:12:02,996 --> 00:12:05,446
about how they come

228
00:12:05,956 --> 00:12:08,616
An Auto Layout can really

229
00:12:08,616 --> 00:12:11,446
considerations, but I'm

230
00:12:11,446 --> 00:12:13,286
about Auto Layout

231
00:12:13,696 --> 00:12:18,126
I want to focus on why having

232
00:12:18,126 --> 00:12:19,996
on so many different levels.

233
00:12:20,456 --> 00:12:22,096
It helps with localization,

234
00:12:22,386 --> 00:12:26,256
adapting to different screen

235
00:12:26,256 --> 00:12:27,696
when type is able to scale.

236
00:12:28,376 --> 00:12:31,296
So first, let's see how

237
00:12:31,296 --> 00:12:33,006
with varying translation

238
00:12:33,476 --> 00:12:37,386
As crazy it sounds, the

239
00:12:37,576 --> 00:12:39,766
the longer the translations

240
00:12:40,196 --> 00:12:42,746
The word edit in English

241
00:12:43,106 --> 00:12:44,896
but in Russian, it's

242
00:12:45,356 --> 00:12:47,876
Just kidding, it's

243
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:52,116
If an English word is less

244
00:12:52,116 --> 00:12:54,986
the translation can be

245
00:12:56,606 --> 00:13:01,316
A seemingly concise English

246
00:12:56,606 --> 00:13:01,316
A seemingly concise English

247
00:13:01,316 --> 00:13:02,316
in another language.

248
00:13:02,876 --> 00:13:09,056
And an English sentence

249
00:13:09,276 --> 00:13:11,116
and might need to

250
00:13:12,486 --> 00:13:15,966
So this variation

251
00:13:15,966 --> 00:13:19,256
of maximum text lines should

252
00:13:19,526 --> 00:13:21,516
and text should be

253
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:23,296
by having a flexible layout.

254
00:13:23,926 --> 00:13:27,866
You need to allow enough space

255
00:13:28,006 --> 00:13:31,156
especially if there's no other

256
00:13:31,896 --> 00:13:33,296
You would hate for the end

257
00:13:33,296 --> 00:13:37,506
of a very important

258
00:13:38,746 --> 00:13:42,436
Titles and other key texts

259
00:13:42,436 --> 00:13:46,746
because it can lose meaning

260
00:13:47,016 --> 00:13:49,836
So those expansion

261
00:13:49,836 --> 00:13:51,436
and I hope it is for you too.

262
00:13:51,776 --> 00:13:55,526
I can't stress enough that

263
00:13:55,896 --> 00:13:58,096
for what you aren't

264
00:13:58,096 --> 00:14:00,156
that you are designing in.

265
00:13:58,096 --> 00:14:00,156
that you are designing in.

266
00:14:00,426 --> 00:14:01,616
Let me show you an example

267
00:14:01,616 --> 00:14:04,736
of a dynamic layout

268
00:14:04,736 --> 00:14:06,216
looks like in a few

269
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:09,726
Here's this What's

270
00:14:09,856 --> 00:14:11,156
that was created

271
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:15,016
In Chinese, it's actually

272
00:14:15,246 --> 00:14:18,406
and in German it's much longer

273
00:14:18,406 --> 00:14:21,516
and would start a Scroll

274
00:14:22,786 --> 00:14:25,416
And here is Thai with

275
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:26,526
and extra line height.

276
00:14:27,006 --> 00:14:32,296
And here's Arabic which is also

277
00:14:33,146 --> 00:14:37,116
It's best to look at each

278
00:14:37,116 --> 00:14:39,816
in each language that

279
00:14:39,816 --> 00:14:41,776
in so you aren't

280
00:14:41,776 --> 00:14:43,486
that will create

281
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:46,976
Accommodating translation

282
00:14:47,196 --> 00:14:48,786
into making your app inclusive

283
00:14:48,786 --> 00:14:50,926
and it will have

284
00:14:50,926 --> 00:14:53,126
from the people who

285
00:14:53,266 --> 00:14:57,226
But I have one more reason

286
00:14:57,676 --> 00:14:59,076
and that's Dynamic Type.

287
00:14:59,676 --> 00:15:03,146
This feature might be one of

288
00:14:59,676 --> 00:15:03,146
This feature might be one of

289
00:15:03,146 --> 00:15:05,906
that you could add to your

290
00:15:07,126 --> 00:15:09,736
In settings, you have the

291
00:15:10,266 --> 00:15:14,196
This enables a broad audience to

292
00:15:14,196 --> 00:15:16,466
in control of their

293
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,276
But it also allows them

294
00:15:18,276 --> 00:15:20,316
to choose how they

295
00:15:21,046 --> 00:15:24,056
Small text sizes may

296
00:15:24,316 --> 00:15:27,086
And larger text sizes

297
00:15:27,746 --> 00:15:29,916
This is a highly used feature.

298
00:15:30,266 --> 00:15:33,466
In fact, who here uses a text

299
00:15:34,886 --> 00:15:37,976
Nice. So let's get

300
00:15:38,046 --> 00:15:39,576
across all of our apps.

301
00:15:40,756 --> 00:15:43,916
And you also might not be aware,

302
00:15:44,146 --> 00:15:48,176
low vision people can get even

303
00:15:48,436 --> 00:15:51,176
And here is Ulysses.

304
00:15:51,426 --> 00:15:54,286
They do a great job scaling

305
00:15:58,326 --> 00:16:01,456
So, how do I specify a

306
00:15:58,326 --> 00:16:01,456
So, how do I specify a

307
00:16:02,646 --> 00:16:05,926
First you start by specifying

308
00:16:05,926 --> 00:16:09,896
for semantically distinct blocks

309
00:16:09,896 --> 00:16:13,106
body, etc. for the platform

310
00:16:14,086 --> 00:16:17,606
This gives ample variety to

311
00:16:17,996 --> 00:16:20,166
and today I've got a

312
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:21,776
when making designs

313
00:16:22,406 --> 00:16:24,806
The font size, leading,

314
00:16:24,806 --> 00:16:26,836
for each style is now published

315
00:16:26,836 --> 00:16:28,866
on the iOS Human

316
00:16:29,146 --> 00:16:30,506
in the typography section.

317
00:16:30,876 --> 00:16:34,956
And you will be able to download

318
00:16:35,516 --> 00:16:40,916
[ Applause ]

319
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:43,446
Okay, so, let's go into detail,

320
00:16:43,506 --> 00:16:46,346
I'm focused for a

321
00:16:46,956 --> 00:16:49,796
These are the font styles

322
00:16:49,796 --> 00:16:51,996
at for the default

323
00:16:52,866 --> 00:16:56,746
When the user slides the

324
00:16:57,456 --> 00:16:59,506
these other columns

325
00:16:59,556 --> 00:17:02,196
that the fonts will appear at.

326
00:16:59,556 --> 00:17:02,196
that the fonts will appear at.

327
00:17:02,376 --> 00:17:05,826
You can see how the font sizes

328
00:17:05,826 --> 00:17:08,386
and down in text

329
00:17:08,386 --> 00:17:09,766
in the text size slider.

330
00:17:10,236 --> 00:17:13,476
And here's an iOS

331
00:17:13,476 --> 00:17:15,816
And I'm going to show you some

332
00:17:16,086 --> 00:17:18,915
about how to use text styles

333
00:17:20,376 --> 00:17:23,796
First, you will need to assign

334
00:17:24,675 --> 00:17:28,256
The sender and the subject

335
00:17:28,256 --> 00:17:31,156
and will be headlined so

336
00:17:32,486 --> 00:17:35,766
The To field and the time stamp

337
00:17:35,956 --> 00:17:37,006
and will be subhead.

338
00:17:37,486 --> 00:17:40,826
And then the message

339
00:17:41,516 --> 00:17:43,676
Then the next step,

340
00:17:43,676 --> 00:17:47,296
to add a baseline measurement

341
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:50,296
of each label to other

342
00:17:51,016 --> 00:17:54,426
And in the dynamic type

343
00:17:54,466 --> 00:17:58,406
to create a ratio to scale

344
00:17:58,696 --> 00:18:00,906
to the font size as it changes.

345
00:17:58,696 --> 00:18:00,906
to the font size as it changes.

346
00:18:01,406 --> 00:18:03,886
These are not fixed

347
00:18:03,886 --> 00:18:04,476
measurements.

348
00:18:06,116 --> 00:18:08,696
The bottom space under

349
00:18:08,726 --> 00:18:10,726
to be specified dynamically

350
00:18:10,936 --> 00:18:13,996
so that the text cluster will

351
00:18:14,056 --> 00:18:18,306
in the header and the

352
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:19,146
follow similarly.

353
00:18:20,486 --> 00:18:22,506
The next step, you'll specify

354
00:18:22,506 --> 00:18:25,046
or enforce the standard

355
00:18:25,406 --> 00:18:28,906
It's important to at least use

356
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:32,266
because the actual value is

357
00:18:32,636 --> 00:18:36,776
You want to be consistent

358
00:18:36,986 --> 00:18:38,926
And lastly, we'll

359
00:18:38,926 --> 00:18:40,636
between horizontal elements.

360
00:18:41,126 --> 00:18:44,506
So now together, with the

361
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:47,166
margins, and padding,

362
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:48,366
to be coded dynamically.

363
00:18:48,826 --> 00:18:50,646
And so now, let's watch

364
00:18:54,286 --> 00:18:57,426
So, ta-da, this is the

365
00:18:57,426 --> 00:18:59,576
growing from large to

366
00:19:00,626 --> 00:19:03,686
There's also another legibility

367
00:19:03,686 --> 00:19:07,366
for free if you use text styles

368
00:19:08,136 --> 00:19:11,586
This helps people who would

369
00:19:11,586 --> 00:19:13,006
reading lightweight fonts.

370
00:19:13,896 --> 00:19:16,056
And additionally,

371
00:19:16,056 --> 00:19:17,406
for tall writing systems.

372
00:19:18,536 --> 00:19:23,456
So sometimes, with the 12.9-inch

373
00:19:23,726 --> 00:19:27,156
or large blocks of texts,

374
00:19:27,156 --> 00:19:28,396
for the reading experience

375
00:19:28,626 --> 00:19:32,096
if the layout margins were

376
00:19:33,336 --> 00:19:35,546
So when you're reading

377
00:19:35,996 --> 00:19:37,886
it's hard for your

378
00:19:37,886 --> 00:19:39,416
to the beginning

379
00:19:40,466 --> 00:19:44,486
So in iOS 9, we introduced the

380
00:19:44,486 --> 00:19:48,766
of UIView to respect a suitable

381
00:19:48,766 --> 00:19:51,646
on the size of the font

382
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:54,286
which makes the margins

383
00:19:56,946 --> 00:19:58,796
And now, so the margins adjust

384
00:19:58,796 --> 00:19:59,976
when the text size

385
00:20:00,976 --> 00:20:03,856
This way, the line

386
00:20:03,856 --> 00:20:06,526
for each font size.

387
00:20:06,636 --> 00:20:08,686
Also, layouts need

388
00:20:08,686 --> 00:20:11,506
for right-to-left writing

389
00:20:11,506 --> 00:20:14,366
and Hebrew because they

390
00:20:14,366 --> 00:20:15,296
of the screen to the left.

391
00:20:15,996 --> 00:20:20,016
These languages require

392
00:20:20,016 --> 00:20:20,626
Here's Tweetbot.

393
00:20:20,816 --> 00:20:24,156
They've done a great job at

394
00:20:24,976 --> 00:20:28,326
If using Auto Layout's leading

395
00:20:28,326 --> 00:20:30,986
the flow and elements

396
00:20:31,506 --> 00:20:33,496
However, it's important

397
00:20:33,496 --> 00:20:35,146
that some things do not mirror.

398
00:20:36,176 --> 00:20:36,916
Like numerals.

399
00:20:37,616 --> 00:20:40,536
They are presented

400
00:20:40,536 --> 00:20:42,266
of right-to-left phrases.

401
00:20:42,986 --> 00:20:51,026
You should not mirror phone

402
00:20:52,426 --> 00:20:56,246
graphs, and video

403
00:20:56,706 --> 00:20:59,916
Video progress sliders

404
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:03,616
to the right and rewind always

405
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:03,616
to the right and rewind always

406
00:21:03,766 --> 00:21:05,066
and fast-forward to the right.

407
00:21:05,896 --> 00:21:09,796
And images do not need to be

408
00:21:09,796 --> 00:21:12,956
of direction or design

409
00:21:12,956 --> 00:21:14,776
to other parts of

410
00:21:15,276 --> 00:21:18,056
So now let's internationalize

411
00:21:18,376 --> 00:21:20,216
so you can see how this

412
00:21:21,506 --> 00:21:24,846
Here's a step one, two,

413
00:21:24,846 --> 00:21:25,936
in a hypothetical app.

414
00:21:26,526 --> 00:21:28,106
If we were going

415
00:21:28,106 --> 00:21:31,276
for right-to-left languages,

416
00:21:31,276 --> 00:21:33,896
through three with step

417
00:21:34,836 --> 00:21:37,856
And then of course,

418
00:21:38,136 --> 00:21:41,266
by making them localizable

419
00:21:41,266 --> 00:21:42,676
of being baked into the art.

420
00:21:43,546 --> 00:21:47,206
But here, the story of the

421
00:21:47,206 --> 00:21:49,656
in the opposite direction

422
00:21:50,126 --> 00:21:54,246
So we would want to mirror each

423
00:21:54,246 --> 00:21:56,166
of the images follows the steps.

424
00:21:56,676 --> 00:21:59,666
However, we should not

425
00:22:00,066 --> 00:22:03,606
because checkmarks

426
00:22:03,686 --> 00:22:06,546
And now, the onboarding

427
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:08,086
for right-to-left languages.

428
00:22:08,646 --> 00:22:13,166
So some things to remember

429
00:22:13,516 --> 00:22:16,686
that translation lengths are

430
00:22:16,686 --> 00:22:20,536
and longer, than the

431
00:22:20,816 --> 00:22:23,826
Dynamic Type is an

432
00:22:23,826 --> 00:22:25,186
that allows scalable type.

433
00:22:25,876 --> 00:22:29,586
And reability margins help

434
00:22:29,826 --> 00:22:31,726
at nice readable line lengths.

435
00:22:32,556 --> 00:22:35,766
And Arabic and Hebrew will

436
00:22:37,176 --> 00:22:38,806
So now we've looked

437
00:22:38,806 --> 00:22:40,776
and I hope your apps

438
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:42,616
to these size changes

439
00:22:43,156 --> 00:22:46,176
There are new additions to the

440
00:22:46,176 --> 00:22:49,076
to implement, so check out

441
00:22:49,106 --> 00:22:50,106
for more information.

442
00:22:50,486 --> 00:22:52,166
The Auditing Your App

443
00:22:52,166 --> 00:22:54,526
for Accessibility

444
00:22:54,526 --> 00:22:57,696
for previewing your app using

445
00:22:58,136 --> 00:23:02,036
and Making Apps Adaptive, Part

446
00:22:58,136 --> 00:23:02,036
and Making Apps Adaptive, Part

447
00:23:02,036 --> 00:23:05,496
of the new Dynamic Type

448
00:23:05,496 --> 00:23:08,376
in International User Interfaces

449
00:23:08,376 --> 00:23:11,116
for handling right-to-left

450
00:23:11,596 --> 00:23:14,726
But now, let's talk about color.

451
00:23:17,086 --> 00:23:20,506
Color is another

452
00:23:21,036 --> 00:23:23,746
There's a -- and there's a lot

453
00:23:23,746 --> 00:23:26,666
for your app because

454
00:23:26,726 --> 00:23:27,696
to the experience.

455
00:23:28,656 --> 00:23:30,126
So first, it's important

456
00:23:30,126 --> 00:23:33,126
to recognize what

457
00:23:33,316 --> 00:23:36,246
to your particular

458
00:23:36,896 --> 00:23:38,696
So let's talk about

459
00:23:38,696 --> 00:23:40,666
of the three most

460
00:23:41,696 --> 00:23:44,916
Surveys have told us that blue

461
00:23:45,036 --> 00:23:46,736
favored color around the world.

462
00:23:47,306 --> 00:23:50,596
And the second most popular

463
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:53,506
but is usually green or red.

464
00:23:55,466 --> 00:23:57,206
So first let's talk about blue.

465
00:23:57,626 --> 00:23:59,496
Why does everybody

466
00:23:59,556 --> 00:24:03,656
I mean, blue has a short

467
00:23:59,556 --> 00:24:03,656
I mean, blue has a short

468
00:24:03,826 --> 00:24:06,606
and actually makes it

469
00:24:07,216 --> 00:24:10,606
And our eyes are trained to

470
00:24:10,956 --> 00:24:13,746
because the short wavelengths

471
00:24:13,746 --> 00:24:14,516
by the molecules.

472
00:24:15,056 --> 00:24:17,516
FYI, that's why the sky's blue.

473
00:24:18,006 --> 00:24:21,926
But also seeing some colors

474
00:24:21,926 --> 00:24:24,486
in your body and lowers

475
00:24:25,586 --> 00:24:27,336
However, universally,

476
00:24:27,456 --> 00:24:30,236
some shades of blue

477
00:24:30,236 --> 00:24:33,206
and loneliness likely

478
00:24:33,416 --> 00:24:35,056
with the vast and

479
00:24:36,946 --> 00:24:38,576
So now, let's talk about green.

480
00:24:39,386 --> 00:24:42,246
It has a wide range of

481
00:24:42,966 --> 00:24:46,426
In the western cultures, it's

482
00:24:46,426 --> 00:24:49,226
live healthy, and

483
00:24:49,526 --> 00:24:52,046
as a natural eco-friendly

484
00:24:53,486 --> 00:24:56,626
In Ireland, green commemorates

485
00:24:56,626 --> 00:24:57,636
on Saint Patrick's Day

486
00:24:58,036 --> 00:24:59,966
and is also known throughout

487
00:25:01,976 --> 00:25:04,776
Green is also a universal

488
00:25:05,246 --> 00:25:08,686
It's used in traffic light

489
00:25:08,686 --> 00:25:11,376
over the world to indicate

490
00:25:12,706 --> 00:25:14,936
So now, let's talk about red.

491
00:25:15,446 --> 00:25:18,126
It's pretty consistent around

492
00:25:18,126 --> 00:25:20,986
up both similar positive

493
00:25:22,316 --> 00:25:25,016
Red has a long wavelength

494
00:25:25,286 --> 00:25:27,496
which grabs our attention

495
00:25:28,626 --> 00:25:32,336
Therefore, in many parts of

496
00:25:32,336 --> 00:25:34,106
of revolution and conflict.

497
00:25:35,656 --> 00:25:38,156
It exudes passion and love.

498
00:25:39,466 --> 00:25:43,286
And to most Asian cultures, red

499
00:25:43,286 --> 00:25:46,006
and good luck because

500
00:25:46,006 --> 00:25:46,936
with the Lunar New Year.

501
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:49,496
And it's also worn at weddings.

502
00:25:50,076 --> 00:25:52,516
In fact, red is so

503
00:25:52,866 --> 00:25:56,786
that the Chinese stock

504
00:25:56,936 --> 00:25:58,276
and green to mean losses.

505
00:25:58,976 --> 00:26:04,416
And the next color consideration

506
00:25:58,976 --> 00:26:04,416
And the next color consideration

507
00:26:04,676 --> 00:26:06,256
And you need to be aware

508
00:26:06,426 --> 00:26:09,156
that color blindness affects

509
00:26:09,576 --> 00:26:13,706
It's actually one in 12

510
00:26:13,996 --> 00:26:15,726
That's almost 5 percent

511
00:26:15,726 --> 00:26:17,716
of the total population

512
00:26:18,786 --> 00:26:22,106
And all of these popular

513
00:26:22,106 --> 00:26:24,056
implications to color

514
00:26:24,656 --> 00:26:26,206
It's not that these are --

515
00:26:26,206 --> 00:26:30,106
these colors are confused with

516
00:26:30,106 --> 00:26:32,936
of blue, red, and green

517
00:26:32,936 --> 00:26:33,826
in all colors.

518
00:26:34,576 --> 00:26:36,356
For one kind of color blindness,

519
00:26:36,476 --> 00:26:39,226
this color palette may

520
00:26:40,276 --> 00:26:42,646
This is why our platforms

521
00:26:42,676 --> 00:26:46,176
to differentiate key information

522
00:26:47,186 --> 00:26:49,706
Like here in mail

523
00:26:49,756 --> 00:26:54,266
between an orange dot or an

524
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:57,766
because if you are color

525
00:26:57,766 --> 00:27:00,796
to tell the difference from

526
00:26:57,766 --> 00:27:00,796
to tell the difference from

527
00:27:00,796 --> 00:27:02,086
with the blue and red dot.

528
00:27:02,576 --> 00:27:06,216
So the additional shape option

529
00:27:06,746 --> 00:27:12,056
And the next topic is about

530
00:27:12,056 --> 00:27:14,766
for legibility between

531
00:27:16,036 --> 00:27:18,566
Contrast is important

532
00:27:18,566 --> 00:27:22,036
because you want people who

533
00:27:22,296 --> 00:27:25,746
as well as situational

534
00:27:25,746 --> 00:27:28,556
or wearing sunglasses to

535
00:27:29,176 --> 00:27:31,166
And to find what

536
00:27:31,486 --> 00:27:34,176
you need to calculate

537
00:27:34,286 --> 00:27:38,906
between two colors or one way

538
00:27:39,226 --> 00:27:42,866
without calculation is to

539
00:27:43,796 --> 00:27:47,236
You can quickly see if the

540
00:27:47,236 --> 00:27:49,976
with each other in your app.

541
00:27:49,976 --> 00:27:52,606
And soon, on the iOS

542
00:27:52,606 --> 00:27:54,636
in the resources

543
00:27:54,636 --> 00:27:57,956
to download a helpful tool

544
00:27:57,956 --> 00:28:02,166
by using RGB values and it

545
00:27:57,956 --> 00:28:02,166
by using RGB values and it

546
00:28:02,166 --> 00:28:04,786
in compliance with common

547
00:28:04,786 --> 00:28:06,366
for different text

548
00:28:07,376 --> 00:28:09,766
But you can also use

549
00:28:09,996 --> 00:28:10,946
ratio calculators.

550
00:28:12,016 --> 00:28:15,236
If we calculate the contrast

551
00:28:15,236 --> 00:28:18,396
and orange, it was

552
00:28:19,146 --> 00:28:21,066
That is not in compliance

553
00:28:21,096 --> 00:28:23,226
because it is a very low ratio.

554
00:28:23,656 --> 00:28:28,306
In fact, 1 to 1 is the

555
00:28:28,586 --> 00:28:29,946
Let's look at another example

556
00:28:29,946 --> 00:28:31,986
to see the highest

557
00:28:32,446 --> 00:28:34,176
and that's between

558
00:28:34,956 --> 00:28:37,696
A contrast ratio calculator

559
00:28:37,696 --> 00:28:40,446
and black has a ratio of 21 to 1

560
00:28:40,766 --> 00:28:45,036
and of course it passes

561
00:28:45,036 --> 00:28:47,936
Now let's check out some gray

562
00:28:49,376 --> 00:28:52,796
The ratio comes in at

563
00:28:53,236 --> 00:28:55,226
It's okay for large font sizes,

564
00:28:55,446 --> 00:28:57,826
but it's too low for

565
00:28:58,176 --> 00:29:01,886
When font sizes are small

566
00:28:58,176 --> 00:29:01,886
When font sizes are small

567
00:29:02,096 --> 00:29:05,196
your eyes can't distinguish

568
00:29:05,236 --> 00:29:06,596
to easily read the text.

569
00:29:07,136 --> 00:29:08,376
Let's look at one more gray.

570
00:29:09,526 --> 00:29:12,726
Maybe not on this screen,

571
00:29:12,726 --> 00:29:16,486
this is really hard to

572
00:29:16,806 --> 00:29:20,176
That's because the

573
00:29:20,176 --> 00:29:22,656
And this fails at

574
00:29:23,106 --> 00:29:26,006
You wouldn't want your

575
00:29:26,006 --> 00:29:29,836
at this low contrast if

576
00:29:29,836 --> 00:29:31,676
and be able to use it.

577
00:29:31,676 --> 00:29:35,336
Ideally gray text should be

578
00:29:35,336 --> 00:29:41,216
or inactive states rather than

579
00:29:41,216 --> 00:29:43,706
Now, have you ever debated

580
00:29:43,706 --> 00:29:45,776
text or black text on

581
00:29:46,186 --> 00:29:47,076
Happens to me all the time.

582
00:29:47,656 --> 00:29:51,026
If we use this calculator,

583
00:29:51,026 --> 00:29:54,786
on an orange button is a

584
00:29:55,206 --> 00:29:58,686
And black text on an

585
00:29:59,196 --> 00:30:03,056
So in this particular example,

586
00:29:59,196 --> 00:30:03,056
So in this particular example,

587
00:30:03,056 --> 00:30:04,416
It's a higher ratio.

588
00:30:05,246 --> 00:30:08,416
Your texts and glyph colors

589
00:30:08,696 --> 00:30:10,976
to the background color for

590
00:30:13,216 --> 00:30:15,186
So some things to

591
00:30:16,106 --> 00:30:19,186
some of the most popular colors

592
00:30:19,186 --> 00:30:19,946
around the world.

593
00:30:21,246 --> 00:30:24,196
Additionally, you should

594
00:30:24,196 --> 00:30:27,426
to show the difference

595
00:30:27,456 --> 00:30:28,786
that have different meanings.

596
00:30:29,846 --> 00:30:33,076
And you need a high color

597
00:30:33,076 --> 00:30:34,736
and backgrounds for legibility.

598
00:30:35,296 --> 00:30:37,536
And so now we've

599
00:30:38,276 --> 00:30:39,706
Let's talk about iconography.

600
00:30:42,446 --> 00:30:44,626
It's important for you to know

601
00:30:44,626 --> 00:30:46,926
that iconography can

602
00:30:46,926 --> 00:30:47,726
around the world too.

603
00:30:48,816 --> 00:30:51,276
Semiotics shows us

604
00:30:51,276 --> 00:30:54,796
of visible symbols is

605
00:30:55,106 --> 00:30:58,736
and how cultural references

606
00:30:59,176 --> 00:31:01,936
For example, to be -- in

607
00:30:59,176 --> 00:31:01,936
For example, to be -- in

608
00:31:02,246 --> 00:31:05,646
the International Red Cross

609
00:31:05,646 --> 00:31:07,066
for protection during conflict.

610
00:31:07,576 --> 00:31:10,526
They have the red cross for

611
00:31:11,096 --> 00:31:13,256
the red crescent

612
00:31:13,786 --> 00:31:16,246
and the red crystal

613
00:31:16,786 --> 00:31:20,566
These religious connotations

614
00:31:20,746 --> 00:31:23,886
risk the safety of people in

615
00:31:24,766 --> 00:31:27,716
So, when you design glyphs

616
00:31:27,716 --> 00:31:29,486
to remember that different areas

617
00:31:29,486 --> 00:31:31,946
of the world might

618
00:31:31,946 --> 00:31:33,706
with even the simplest

619
00:31:34,716 --> 00:31:37,636
Something as simple as a hand

620
00:31:37,636 --> 00:31:38,246
around the world.

621
00:31:38,906 --> 00:31:43,026
In most places, it means stop or

622
00:31:43,776 --> 00:31:47,096
But in Hinduism and Buddhism,

623
00:31:47,096 --> 00:31:49,256
of Abhaya and it means no fear.

624
00:31:50,416 --> 00:31:54,076
However, maybe you wanted to

625
00:31:54,076 --> 00:31:57,716
to spread out the fingers

626
00:31:57,716 --> 00:31:59,606
in a glyph, but an open,

627
00:31:59,746 --> 00:32:02,996
facing palm is actually

628
00:31:59,746 --> 00:32:02,996
facing palm is actually

629
00:32:03,306 --> 00:32:04,886
And I'm not going to

630
00:32:06,746 --> 00:32:11,156
Additionally, non-directional

631
00:32:11,156 --> 00:32:14,636
to be more universal

632
00:32:14,896 --> 00:32:16,466
on one region's alphabet

633
00:32:16,676 --> 00:32:19,256
or particular cultural

634
00:32:19,496 --> 00:32:22,966
For example, iBooks using

635
00:32:22,966 --> 00:32:25,936
of a book showing the binding

636
00:32:25,936 --> 00:32:27,146
for right-to-left locals.

637
00:32:28,096 --> 00:32:31,366
You don't want to alienate

638
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:33,946
because they can't

639
00:32:34,176 --> 00:32:37,626
or if something will

640
00:32:37,626 --> 00:32:39,556
Also, sometimes you

641
00:32:39,556 --> 00:32:40,896
that mimic other

642
00:32:40,896 --> 00:32:44,336
For example, in right-to-left

643
00:32:44,616 --> 00:32:46,776
the notification

644
00:32:46,776 --> 00:32:49,726
to match the way it appears on

645
00:32:50,256 --> 00:32:51,756
The badge should be on the left

646
00:32:51,756 --> 00:32:54,526
of the glyph representing

647
00:32:55,076 --> 00:32:58,636
So some things to remember

648
00:32:59,076 --> 00:33:01,866
iconography can conflict

649
00:32:59,076 --> 00:33:01,866
iconography can conflict

650
00:33:02,036 --> 00:33:04,116
or symbols can have

651
00:33:05,126 --> 00:33:09,276
Iconography are ideally

652
00:33:10,426 --> 00:33:14,036
And iconography should match

653
00:33:14,066 --> 00:33:15,286
for right-to-left languages.

654
00:33:15,966 --> 00:33:19,956
You want the meaning of your

655
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:23,536
and used, not offensive,

656
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:30,156
Okay, so we've looked at ways in

657
00:33:30,156 --> 00:33:32,276
to be more intuitive

658
00:33:32,466 --> 00:33:34,296
for a culturally

659
00:33:34,666 --> 00:33:37,306
and in ways in which

660
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:39,346
around more assessable

661
00:33:39,886 --> 00:33:43,666
But it's a lot to consider and

662
00:33:43,856 --> 00:33:45,746
if you're doing something

663
00:33:46,466 --> 00:33:49,996
So what I encourage you to

664
00:33:50,176 --> 00:33:52,946
in the countries you plan to

665
00:33:53,116 --> 00:33:54,386
and ask them for feedback.

666
00:33:54,726 --> 00:33:57,076
Ask them how they

667
00:33:57,076 --> 00:33:58,946
If it feels logical

668
00:33:59,246 --> 00:34:01,266
Is everything easy to read?

669
00:33:59,246 --> 00:34:01,266
Is everything easy to read?

670
00:34:01,266 --> 00:34:03,756
And then I want you

671
00:34:04,066 --> 00:34:05,906
"How can you be more inclusive?"

672
00:34:06,426 --> 00:34:11,505
So to watch this talk again,

673
00:34:11,505 --> 00:34:13,775
and to also find

674
00:34:13,775 --> 00:34:15,085
for what I discussed today.

675
00:34:15,516 --> 00:34:16,926
And it also has a link

676
00:34:16,926 --> 00:34:20,866
to the completely redesigned

677
00:34:21,536 --> 00:34:24,755
It has been migrated to

678
00:34:24,996 --> 00:34:27,766
with fresh imagery and

679
00:34:27,766 --> 00:34:29,266
for designing great apps.

680
00:34:29,946 --> 00:34:32,206
It's also been updated

681
00:34:32,206 --> 00:34:34,505
on the new features in iOS 10.

682
00:34:36,076 --> 00:34:39,186
Be sure to check out these

683
00:34:39,186 --> 00:34:39,795
all week.

684
00:34:40,076 --> 00:34:42,346
As I mentioned before,

685
00:34:42,346 --> 00:34:45,826
and Fonts tomorrow morning

686
00:34:45,826 --> 00:34:48,176

All information that

694
00:35:04,786 --> 00:35:06,696
to put my considerations

695
00:35:07,406 --> 00:35:08,326
And the What's New

696
00:35:08,326 --> 00:35:11,896
in International User Interfaces

697
00:35:11,936 --> 00:35:14,926
for handling the right-to-left

698
00:35:15,276 --> 00:35:16,976
Thank you and have
