00:00:22,046 --> 00:00:22,406
&gt;&gt; Alright.

3
00:00:22,406 --> 00:00:23,556
Good afternoon, everyone.

00:00:24,061 --> 00:00:26,061
[ Applause ]

5
00:00:26,106 --> 00:00:28,876
Welcome, and thank you for

6
00:00:29,026 --> 00:00:32,735
My name is Ryan Griggs, and I

7
00:00:33,216 --> 00:00:36,546
and I am thrilled to be here

8
00:00:36,546 --> 00:00:39,346
about some of the great things

9
00:00:39,396 --> 00:00:42,326
how to get set up, and

10
00:00:43,206 --> 00:00:45,866
So we have a lot to cover

11
00:00:45,866 --> 00:00:47,716
through a quick agenda

12
00:00:47,716 --> 00:00:49,566
in the presentation as

13
00:00:49,896 --> 00:00:53,336
So first we'll do a quick intro

14
00:00:53,336 --> 00:00:55,836
of sort of why News exists,

15
00:00:55,836 --> 00:00:58,446
We'll also take a quick look

16
00:00:58,446 --> 00:01:01,276
as far as where your,

17
00:00:58,446 --> 00:01:01,276
as far as where your,

18
00:01:01,276 --> 00:01:02,586
and your publication

19
00:01:03,416 --> 00:01:05,796
And then next we'll

20
00:01:05,796 --> 00:01:09,816
up your channel using News

21
00:01:09,816 --> 00:01:11,976
that we use to manage

22
00:01:13,666 --> 00:01:16,136
Then we'll do a quick

23
00:01:16,136 --> 00:01:20,896
and then we'll dive a bit

24
00:01:21,976 --> 00:01:23,826
Then we'll also talk about how

25
00:01:23,826 --> 00:01:26,016
to publish articles

26
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:28,096
We have a few different

27
00:01:28,096 --> 00:01:30,896
to author and then deliver

28
00:01:31,726 --> 00:01:33,736
We'll talk about how to

29
00:01:34,496 --> 00:01:36,306
Talk about analytics

30
00:01:36,306 --> 00:01:37,706
Specifically, what's

31
00:01:37,706 --> 00:01:41,306
as an Apple News Format

32
00:01:41,306 --> 00:01:42,536
about a few best practices

33
00:01:42,536 --> 00:01:45,976
for making your publication

34
00:01:47,426 --> 00:01:51,186
So, first, let's do a quick

35
00:01:51,856 --> 00:01:56,126
So News was launched with

36
00:01:56,126 --> 00:01:58,976
of delivering the best stories

37
00:01:59,226 --> 00:02:00,846
and then personalizing

38
00:01:59,226 --> 00:02:00,846
and then personalizing

39
00:02:02,426 --> 00:02:06,596
And so News is built right into

40
00:02:06,596 --> 00:02:12,116
to anyone with an iOS device

41
00:02:12,116 --> 00:02:15,056
of the three countries News is

42
00:02:15,056 --> 00:02:18,536
in the U.S., U.K. and

43
00:02:20,156 --> 00:02:23,856
And so one of the big parts

44
00:02:24,206 --> 00:02:26,316
which is our JSON

45
00:02:26,576 --> 00:02:30,086
It makes it possible to create

46
00:02:30,086 --> 00:02:32,426
experiences within

47
00:02:32,426 --> 00:02:34,596
And so we'll talk a bit

48
00:02:35,066 --> 00:02:37,876
But in order to understand

49
00:02:37,876 --> 00:02:40,986
I wanted to show you a few

50
00:02:40,986 --> 00:02:41,866
of what you can do with it.

51
00:02:41,866 --> 00:02:44,556
So this one is an

52
00:02:44,556 --> 00:02:47,316
and we'll actually

53
00:02:47,316 --> 00:02:49,246
and take a look at

54
00:02:49,246 --> 00:02:51,436
You can see there's a little

55
00:02:51,436 --> 00:02:52,556
There's beautiful imagery.

56
00:02:52,556 --> 00:02:54,216
This is a photo mosaic.

57
00:02:54,526 --> 00:02:56,916
Can tap in on the photos,

58
00:02:57,526 --> 00:02:59,926
It's really great,

59
00:02:59,976 --> 00:03:02,866
And you'll also notice, too,

60
00:02:59,976 --> 00:03:02,866
And you'll also notice, too,

61
00:03:02,866 --> 00:03:04,286
of course, a, a "Wired" article.

62
00:03:04,646 --> 00:03:05,886
This looks like "Wired".

63
00:03:05,886 --> 00:03:08,496
And so we give you the

64
00:03:08,496 --> 00:03:10,456
and your channel

65
00:03:11,876 --> 00:03:13,916
So here's another

66
00:03:14,226 --> 00:03:17,666
Very different look to this,

67
00:03:17,756 --> 00:03:18,956
with some beautiful photography.

68
00:03:18,956 --> 00:03:21,736
You see we have some of

69
00:03:22,096 --> 00:03:25,156
As you scroll, some really

70
00:03:25,276 --> 00:03:26,816
Great use of parallax here.

71
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:31,376
It really shows a lot of emotion

72
00:03:31,946 --> 00:03:33,336
So another great example.

73
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:34,276
Show you one more.

74
00:03:34,276 --> 00:03:35,116
This one in iPad.

75
00:03:35,116 --> 00:03:37,966
You can really do a lot of

76
00:03:37,966 --> 00:03:40,166
and this is an example of

77
00:03:40,566 --> 00:03:43,216
who really created something

78
00:03:43,216 --> 00:03:44,876
that makes you want

79
00:03:44,876 --> 00:03:47,426
and see what other great

80
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:51,176
So Apple News Format gives you

81
00:03:52,086 --> 00:03:53,686
So let's take a quick

82
00:03:54,146 --> 00:03:56,466
Just understand where

83
00:03:56,946 --> 00:03:59,936
So News is organized

84
00:04:00,746 --> 00:04:02,206
So first we have For You.

85
00:04:02,206 --> 00:04:06,176
For You is a personalized feed

86
00:04:06,176 --> 00:04:08,156
that you're interested in based

87
00:04:08,156 --> 00:04:08,816
and what you're reading.

88
00:04:09,536 --> 00:04:11,726
And it's got a huge update,

89
00:04:12,246 --> 00:04:15,736
We have a completely new

90
00:04:15,736 --> 00:04:19,766
and feel but also the concept of

91
00:04:19,766 --> 00:04:22,996
like trending, topic groups

92
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:26,736
in News, and then featured

93
00:04:26,736 --> 00:04:28,176
to find some of the

94
00:04:28,376 --> 00:04:30,286
engaging Apple News

95
00:04:30,286 --> 00:04:32,176
and feature them

96
00:04:33,716 --> 00:04:34,516
Favorites.

97
00:04:34,516 --> 00:04:35,896
This is where your

98
00:04:35,896 --> 00:04:37,866
when a user taps the Plus

99
00:04:37,866 --> 00:04:41,306
and it allows you just to return

100
00:04:42,356 --> 00:04:43,546
And then we have Explorer.

101
00:04:44,026 --> 00:04:47,606
This is where users will

102
00:04:47,876 --> 00:04:51,156
and then new topics, and so we

103
00:04:51,156 --> 00:04:55,386
to publications, and these

104
00:04:55,386 --> 00:04:58,126
of articles from

105
00:04:58,126 --> 00:04:59,286
around a specific topic.

106
00:04:59,286 --> 00:05:01,546
So you can follow

107
00:04:59,286 --> 00:05:01,546
So you can follow

108
00:05:01,546 --> 00:05:03,516
or heavy metal or

109
00:05:04,756 --> 00:05:06,576
Then, of course, we have Search.

110
00:05:06,686 --> 00:05:08,706
We have hundreds of

111
00:05:08,706 --> 00:05:10,216
and you can search for topics

112
00:05:10,276 --> 00:05:12,476
and publications

113
00:05:12,476 --> 00:05:15,196
And then, finally, your

114
00:05:15,196 --> 00:05:18,016
If a user starts reading

115
00:05:18,016 --> 00:05:20,556
to finish reading it

116
00:05:20,556 --> 00:05:22,746
at your history and clear

117
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:26,376
So that's how News is

118
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:29,196
So during this session, we're

119
00:05:29,196 --> 00:05:31,556
of the best practices when

120
00:05:31,556 --> 00:05:34,816
to get set up, but, first,

121
00:05:35,186 --> 00:05:36,806
and how it shows up in News.

122
00:05:37,146 --> 00:05:39,906
So publications in News

123
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:41,326
So what is a channel?

124
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:43,966
Well, this is what a

125
00:05:43,966 --> 00:05:45,676
and this is the one

126
00:05:45,676 --> 00:05:48,126
in News today in

127
00:05:48,576 --> 00:05:51,256
So channels represent your

128
00:05:51,256 --> 00:05:52,896
of like your home page.

129
00:05:53,356 --> 00:05:56,036
Articles you publish

130
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:59,556
and it's where users can

131
00:05:59,556 --> 00:06:01,806
and directly specifically

132
00:05:59,556 --> 00:06:01,806
and directly specifically

133
00:06:03,236 --> 00:06:06,046
So a good example for, of

134
00:06:06,046 --> 00:06:09,486
a magazines, a newspaper,

135
00:06:10,606 --> 00:06:11,876
They're very customizable.

136
00:06:11,876 --> 00:06:14,306
So you can really make them

137
00:06:14,306 --> 00:06:17,706
So you can do things

138
00:06:17,706 --> 00:06:19,856
add a cover image, which

139
00:06:19,856 --> 00:06:22,256
and customize sections

140
00:06:22,806 --> 00:06:24,996
And you can create

141
00:06:24,996 --> 00:06:28,406
So if you have more than one

142
00:06:28,536 --> 00:06:30,286
you can have a separate

143
00:06:31,846 --> 00:06:35,396
They can be based on Apple News

144
00:06:35,396 --> 00:06:37,546
to them just using

145
00:06:39,936 --> 00:06:42,256
So how do we set up a

146
00:06:42,966 --> 00:06:44,826
or to set up a channel

147
00:06:44,826 --> 00:06:49,216
You go to our web, online web

148
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:52,996
And so News Publisher

149
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:54,666
to manage your presence

150
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:57,706
It lets you do things like

151
00:06:57,706 --> 00:06:59,606
for your channels to

152
00:06:59,606 --> 00:07:00,776
and works like you want it to.

153
00:06:59,606 --> 00:07:00,776
and works like you want it to.

154
00:07:00,856 --> 00:07:03,786
It lets you assign roles to

155
00:07:04,546 --> 00:07:08,276
It lets you view analytics, set

156
00:07:08,346 --> 00:07:10,576
on how your articles and

157
00:07:11,646 --> 00:07:14,156
It also helps you set

158
00:07:14,156 --> 00:07:15,096
and helps you manage it.

159
00:07:16,566 --> 00:07:20,036
It even lets you create Apple

160
00:07:20,036 --> 00:07:22,266
from News Publisher, and we'll

161
00:07:23,626 --> 00:07:25,176
So a few things to think

162
00:07:25,176 --> 00:07:27,006
about before you sign

163
00:07:27,286 --> 00:07:28,676
You want to consider who will,

164
00:07:28,676 --> 00:07:29,946
who's going to manage

165
00:07:30,336 --> 00:07:32,746
Think about people like interns.

166
00:07:32,746 --> 00:07:35,116
They eventually leave, and

167
00:07:35,116 --> 00:07:37,016
to your account to an intern

168
00:07:37,016 --> 00:07:38,216
that won't be here

169
00:07:38,216 --> 00:07:40,726
So make sure you give

170
00:07:40,726 --> 00:07:42,056
who will be with

171
00:07:42,326 --> 00:07:43,826
So a common problem

172
00:07:44,606 --> 00:07:47,576
You also want to use a real

173
00:07:47,576 --> 00:07:50,556
Sounds like an obvious thing,

174
00:07:50,556 --> 00:07:53,236
with you via this e-mail

175
00:07:53,536 --> 00:07:55,996
for example, your RSS

176
00:07:55,996 --> 00:07:57,376
in your Apple News

177
00:07:57,806 --> 00:07:59,606
And so we want to be able to

178
00:08:00,096 --> 00:08:02,706
And also think about

179
00:08:03,476 --> 00:08:05,706
So News is available in the

180
00:08:05,706 --> 00:08:07,816
You want to make sure

181
00:08:07,816 --> 00:08:10,076
to deliver whatever

182
00:08:10,076 --> 00:08:13,186
etc. in Apple News

183
00:08:13,186 --> 00:08:17,016
And so the easiest way to sign

184
00:08:17,016 --> 00:08:20,396
to go to our developer page or

185
00:08:20,396 --> 00:08:22,926
to the bottom, and then

186
00:08:22,996 --> 00:08:25,556
That will take you

187
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:28,046
So News Publisher

188
00:08:28,046 --> 00:08:30,306
If you don't have one already,

189
00:08:30,306 --> 00:08:32,775
to set one up, although I

190
00:08:32,775 --> 00:08:33,216
have one.

191
00:08:33,716 --> 00:08:36,025
And then once you've signed

192
00:08:36,356 --> 00:08:39,525
the News Publisher icon

193
00:08:39,525 --> 00:08:41,856
to your other icons so you can

194
00:08:42,525 --> 00:08:44,706
It's one of the great things

195
00:08:45,156 --> 00:08:46,596
that when you use the same one

196
00:08:46,596 --> 00:08:47,986
as on your iOS device

197
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:49,986
to easily preview articles

198
00:08:49,986 --> 00:08:50,656
on your device.

199
00:08:53,696 --> 00:08:55,486
So this is what News

200
00:08:55,546 --> 00:08:58,636
We're not going to dive into

201
00:08:58,636 --> 00:09:00,896
to start up by talking about

202
00:08:58,636 --> 00:09:00,896
to start up by talking about

203
00:09:01,036 --> 00:09:02,856
when you're setting

204
00:09:03,846 --> 00:09:06,276
So every channel, no

205
00:09:07,096 --> 00:09:09,116
or Apple News format,

206
00:09:09,336 --> 00:09:12,406
One, it needs sections; two,

207
00:09:12,646 --> 00:09:14,306
and it needs a cover image.

208
00:09:14,986 --> 00:09:18,086
And so let's talk about the best

209
00:09:18,976 --> 00:09:20,066
So, first, sections.

210
00:09:20,496 --> 00:09:23,836
So sections make it possible

211
00:09:23,836 --> 00:09:27,416
So, like, entertainment,

212
00:09:28,246 --> 00:09:30,516
You can have a lot

213
00:09:30,516 --> 00:09:33,286
but we really recommend

214
00:09:33,546 --> 00:09:36,866
because essentially we

215
00:09:36,866 --> 00:09:39,706
to find more channels that are

216
00:09:39,706 --> 00:09:42,646
to fit on an iPhone

217
00:09:44,046 --> 00:09:47,146
And for the same reason as

218
00:09:47,146 --> 00:09:49,686
as you need, keep

219
00:09:49,866 --> 00:09:51,166
You don't want to

220
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:52,706
that push your other

221
00:09:52,836 --> 00:09:56,026
It's important to note that

222
00:09:56,116 --> 00:09:56,646
the default.

223
00:09:56,646 --> 00:09:59,306
So when users come to your

224
00:09:59,306 --> 00:10:00,976
this is what they

225
00:09:59,306 --> 00:10:00,976
this is what they

226
00:10:01,076 --> 00:10:02,576
It's sort of like

227
00:10:03,036 --> 00:10:04,456
that they'll, that

228
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:08,486
Another really important

229
00:10:08,486 --> 00:10:12,216
and builds the For You feed,

230
00:10:12,216 --> 00:10:16,006
that are in your default first

231
00:10:16,006 --> 00:10:17,836
from there and not

232
00:10:18,516 --> 00:10:21,786
So if you want to have your

233
00:10:21,786 --> 00:10:25,606
For You, for, in user's Apple

234
00:10:25,606 --> 00:10:28,296
that you're publishing them

235
00:10:30,056 --> 00:10:32,306
So for the channel logo,

236
00:10:32,646 --> 00:10:35,206
the channel logo is

237
00:10:35,546 --> 00:10:37,206
of your publication's logo.

238
00:10:37,796 --> 00:10:39,806
And so for maximum

239
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:42,906
to be horizontal

240
00:10:42,906 --> 00:10:44,866
use transparent background

241
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:46,926
If you don't use a transparent

242
00:10:46,926 --> 00:10:49,026
up with a logo that looks

243
00:10:49,026 --> 00:10:51,966
Something that we see fairly

244
00:10:52,586 --> 00:10:53,856
to reach out to publishers

245
00:10:54,376 --> 00:10:56,806
Also avoid using

246
00:10:56,806 --> 00:10:58,466
They're going to end

247
00:10:58,466 --> 00:11:00,436
in the various places

248
00:10:58,466 --> 00:11:00,436
in the various places

249
00:11:00,686 --> 00:11:03,526
and sometimes we end up just

250
00:11:03,526 --> 00:11:04,836
because they don't

251
00:11:05,696 --> 00:11:10,326
We recommend having a logo

252
00:11:10,326 --> 00:11:13,066
and then not more than

253
00:11:13,066 --> 00:11:14,796
but don't make it any

254
00:11:15,226 --> 00:11:17,656
Otherwise, it will make

255
00:11:17,656 --> 00:11:19,116
in some places like 4U Feeds.

256
00:11:19,116 --> 00:11:22,466
If you can, avoid

257
00:11:22,466 --> 00:11:24,916
and trademarks alongside

258
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:27,416
In many places, the logos

259
00:11:27,756 --> 00:11:29,686
and they just get lost

260
00:11:30,626 --> 00:11:33,516
And then, finally, with

261
00:11:33,516 --> 00:11:36,036
you typically want to avoid

262
00:11:36,186 --> 00:11:38,546
The promotional text will be

263
00:11:38,546 --> 00:11:39,936
and just makes your

264
00:11:39,936 --> 00:11:42,546
And then URL's set

265
00:11:42,546 --> 00:11:45,846
that they will be tappable,

266
00:11:47,616 --> 00:11:52,426
And so this is what a channel

267
00:11:52,606 --> 00:11:54,826
And so this is a

268
00:11:54,826 --> 00:11:58,436
for your channel logo to look

269
00:11:58,436 --> 00:12:01,856
of our users spend time in 4U,

270
00:11:58,436 --> 00:12:01,856
of our users spend time in 4U,

271
00:12:01,856 --> 00:12:04,236
that your logo looks great

272
00:12:05,276 --> 00:12:08,416
So your logo also appears

273
00:12:08,866 --> 00:12:11,036
and so the channel tile is a

274
00:12:11,036 --> 00:12:12,766
and what we call a cover image.

275
00:12:13,936 --> 00:12:16,346
And a channel tile is

276
00:12:16,626 --> 00:12:19,896
within News to bring readers

277
00:12:19,896 --> 00:12:24,826
like in favorites, but it's also

278
00:12:24,826 --> 00:12:27,506
in News, including our

279
00:12:27,506 --> 00:12:30,806
This is where users first

280
00:12:30,806 --> 00:12:33,296
about who they're going to

281
00:12:33,296 --> 00:12:35,656
And so this is going to be

282
00:12:35,656 --> 00:12:38,266
especially for those users

283
00:12:38,266 --> 00:12:39,206
about your publication.

284
00:12:39,206 --> 00:12:41,376
You want to make sure

285
00:12:41,376 --> 00:12:43,386
and a great cover image

286
00:12:43,606 --> 00:12:46,626
of what your brand is all

287
00:12:47,306 --> 00:12:50,886
We also have channel

288
00:12:51,216 --> 00:12:54,956
where editors can feature them,

289
00:12:54,956 --> 00:12:57,106
in the For You feed

290
00:12:57,296 --> 00:13:01,366
So it's a really important way

291
00:12:57,296 --> 00:13:01,366
So it's a really important way

292
00:13:01,486 --> 00:13:03,806
to follow your channel

293
00:13:04,956 --> 00:13:08,266
So to make the cover image look

294
00:13:08,266 --> 00:13:11,866
please submit a high-quality,

295
00:13:11,866 --> 00:13:14,266
We recommend 600 x 600 pixels.

296
00:13:14,336 --> 00:13:17,076
You can choose two

297
00:13:17,076 --> 00:13:19,006
You can either do

298
00:13:19,376 --> 00:13:21,136
which means that it

299
00:13:21,436 --> 00:13:22,816
This is great for brands

300
00:13:22,816 --> 00:13:26,356
that have a really

301
00:13:26,356 --> 00:13:29,096
an image that users will

302
00:13:29,786 --> 00:13:32,856
but you can also choose to have

303
00:13:33,246 --> 00:13:35,826
This is great if you want users

304
00:13:35,826 --> 00:13:38,916
and they see your tile,

305
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:42,146
from articles in your feed,

306
00:13:42,146 --> 00:13:43,866
and dynamic with what's

307
00:13:45,316 --> 00:13:48,116
So when you're signing up

308
00:13:48,336 --> 00:13:49,826
you'll eventually

309
00:13:50,216 --> 00:13:52,826
where you can choose whether to

310
00:13:52,826 --> 00:13:54,246
or whether to use RSS.

311
00:13:54,376 --> 00:13:56,586
So we're going to talk

312
00:13:57,786 --> 00:14:00,236
Let's briefly talk about RSS.

313
00:13:57,786 --> 00:14:00,236
Let's briefly talk about RSS.

314
00:14:00,716 --> 00:14:03,116
So when does it make

315
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:07,046
So News supports displaying

316
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:10,026
if you have one, and it's

317
00:14:10,026 --> 00:14:13,386
if you already have a website

318
00:14:13,516 --> 00:14:15,956
and you want to get your content

319
00:14:16,776 --> 00:14:20,066
But, ultimately, we only

320
00:14:20,066 --> 00:14:23,056
as a stepping stone to

321
00:14:23,466 --> 00:14:26,576
It's important to note that the

322
00:14:26,576 --> 00:14:29,136
in Apple News are using

323
00:14:29,366 --> 00:14:30,806
and so they're really engaging.

324
00:14:31,076 --> 00:14:33,996
They have animations and

325
00:14:33,996 --> 00:14:35,296
that Apple News format allows.

326
00:14:35,656 --> 00:14:38,516
And so if you're not using

327
00:14:38,516 --> 00:14:41,066
it's not a great comparison.

328
00:14:41,066 --> 00:14:43,596
So we, it's always best

329
00:14:43,596 --> 00:14:46,006
But if you do need to use Apple

330
00:14:46,006 --> 00:14:47,466
to use RSS, these are some

331
00:14:47,626 --> 00:14:50,386
of the features that,

332
00:14:50,386 --> 00:14:52,356
Gives you the ability

333
00:14:52,356 --> 00:14:53,526
headlines, and excerpts.

334
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:57,366
We also show a preview

335
00:14:57,366 --> 00:14:58,606
that it pulls from your feed.

336
00:14:59,016 --> 00:15:02,816
And so this allows

337
00:14:59,016 --> 00:15:02,816
And so this allows

338
00:15:02,816 --> 00:15:04,796
to load really quickly

339
00:15:04,796 --> 00:15:06,146
to load from your web page.

340
00:15:06,866 --> 00:15:08,506
We host the RSS excerpt.

341
00:15:08,506 --> 00:15:11,566
So when you use a [inaudible]

342
00:15:11,566 --> 00:15:13,596
And then, of course,

343
00:15:13,596 --> 00:15:16,626
you ultimately will host your

344
00:15:16,626 --> 00:15:18,526
through to your web page.

345
00:15:19,986 --> 00:15:22,306
So there's some best

346
00:15:22,306 --> 00:15:25,376
You want to make your

347
00:15:25,826 --> 00:15:29,186
If you make it really short,

348
00:15:29,186 --> 00:15:31,786
see that it's only a sentence

349
00:15:31,786 --> 00:15:34,066
and look for one of the many

350
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:36,046
that offer a full experience.

351
00:15:37,696 --> 00:15:41,486
So use long form, full

352
00:15:42,186 --> 00:15:44,516
and avoid links to

353
00:15:44,816 --> 00:15:47,086
Things like boilerplates,

354
00:15:47,086 --> 00:15:49,836
terms and conditions, user

355
00:15:49,836 --> 00:15:52,226
You don't really need

356
00:15:52,366 --> 00:15:55,066
and it just clutters up the

357
00:15:55,066 --> 00:15:57,666
from the simplicity and

358
00:15:58,446 --> 00:16:01,526
And then Apple News

359
00:15:58,446 --> 00:16:01,526
And then Apple News

360
00:16:01,526 --> 00:16:05,066
into some great sharing features

361
00:16:05,066 --> 00:16:07,366
to using to share your

362
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:10,906
to include links like tweet

363
00:16:11,256 --> 00:16:13,126
The app already takes

364
00:16:13,126 --> 00:16:14,656
it just adds noise

365
00:16:15,496 --> 00:16:20,506
Make sure your actual web page

366
00:16:20,656 --> 00:16:22,866
The worst thing you can

367
00:16:22,866 --> 00:16:24,386
through the preview,

368
00:16:24,386 --> 00:16:26,926
and then they have a big

369
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:30,246
Then, finally, similar to

370
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:32,286
make sure you provide a

371
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:34,336
So something happens

372
00:16:34,336 --> 00:16:36,986
and we're having trouble getting

373
00:16:36,986 --> 00:16:38,506
we want to be able

374
00:16:40,056 --> 00:16:42,846
So when you first set up your

375
00:16:42,846 --> 00:16:47,176
you can configure your feeds,

376
00:16:47,176 --> 00:16:49,026
up your sections that

377
00:16:49,026 --> 00:16:50,646
So you start out with

378
00:16:50,646 --> 00:16:52,746
This is the one that

379
00:16:53,216 --> 00:16:55,246
and you can customize

380
00:16:55,246 --> 00:16:57,806
You can change the name, and

381
00:16:57,806 --> 00:17:01,036
up your RSS feed, you can have

382
00:16:57,806 --> 00:17:01,036
up your RSS feed, you can have

383
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:02,406
per section if you like.

384
00:17:02,406 --> 00:17:05,016
And so this is what it looks

385
00:17:05,126 --> 00:17:08,715
You can reorder them, and change

386
00:17:10,856 --> 00:17:13,086
And so once you're up and

387
00:17:13,086 --> 00:17:17,935
in Apple News, this is what your

388
00:17:17,935 --> 00:17:18,465
look like.

389
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:20,915
You'll see we have a couple

390
00:17:20,915 --> 00:17:24,386
and manage your sections,

391
00:17:26,576 --> 00:17:30,196
But, ultimately, you want to

392
00:17:30,196 --> 00:17:32,526
as soon as you can, and so

393
00:17:32,526 --> 00:17:34,096
at the top that makes

394
00:17:34,516 --> 00:17:37,286
Once you click that, you can

395
00:17:37,286 --> 00:17:39,166
and that'll move you on

396
00:17:40,216 --> 00:17:42,086
So what can you do

397
00:17:42,086 --> 00:17:42,926
Why is it so great?

398
00:17:43,126 --> 00:17:48,406
Well, first, we provide a, a

399
00:17:48,406 --> 00:17:50,306
We have points of

400
00:17:50,306 --> 00:17:52,926
that ensures lightning

401
00:17:52,926 --> 00:17:54,806
Nothing will ensure people

402
00:17:54,806 --> 00:17:56,426
like an article that

403
00:17:58,056 --> 00:17:59,846
We also supply rich analytics,

404
00:18:00,836 --> 00:18:03,786
and we also automatically

405
00:18:03,786 --> 00:18:06,906
Apple News format is really

406
00:18:06,906 --> 00:18:10,296
and having it look great on

407
00:18:11,206 --> 00:18:14,576
We provide simple but

408
00:18:15,556 --> 00:18:19,166
We have a dedicated Apple News

409
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:21,116
looking for great

410
00:18:21,116 --> 00:18:23,066
and that's a huge

411
00:18:23,066 --> 00:18:26,326
if you're creating really

412
00:18:26,546 --> 00:18:28,016
We also have built-in

413
00:18:28,016 --> 00:18:31,296
So if publish an article

414
00:18:31,716 --> 00:18:35,956
it's really easy to have at

415
00:18:35,956 --> 00:18:38,846
from your channel and related

416
00:18:39,216 --> 00:18:40,816
It's a great way to

417
00:18:41,996 --> 00:18:44,826
Apple News format itself

418
00:18:45,146 --> 00:18:47,956
like animations,

419
00:18:47,956 --> 00:18:50,796
videos, photo mosaics.

420
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:52,666
It's incredibly powerful

421
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:54,496
to add these elements

422
00:18:55,226 --> 00:18:58,026
We also support dynamic

423
00:18:58,026 --> 00:19:02,806
If you have that set in iOS

424
00:18:58,026 --> 00:19:02,806
If you have that set in iOS

425
00:19:03,346 --> 00:19:05,506
and then we're also

426
00:19:05,506 --> 00:19:07,366
We have great support for

427
00:19:07,366 --> 00:19:08,626
in iOS like voice over.

428
00:19:08,996 --> 00:19:11,146
And we have lots of

429
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:13,476
of content into Apple News.

430
00:19:13,546 --> 00:19:17,306
So lots of advantages to

431
00:19:18,376 --> 00:19:21,556
And so we clicked our

432
00:19:21,896 --> 00:19:25,436
and we've been approved

433
00:19:25,436 --> 00:19:27,236
And so we've got our channel

434
00:19:27,236 --> 00:19:31,316
to deliver an article into Apple

435
00:19:31,316 --> 00:19:33,616
and make sure that it's

436
00:19:33,616 --> 00:19:34,636
and is working as it should,

437
00:19:34,636 --> 00:19:36,286
and so you can do

438
00:19:37,316 --> 00:19:39,976
You can do that by creating

439
00:19:39,976 --> 00:19:43,866
authoring tool, or you can

440
00:19:43,866 --> 00:19:46,316
And so we'll talk about both

441
00:19:47,196 --> 00:19:50,386
but let's say that you've

442
00:19:50,386 --> 00:19:53,356
We'll take a moment to look

443
00:19:53,356 --> 00:19:55,086
through a pending state.

444
00:19:55,086 --> 00:19:56,846
And then once you're

445
00:19:57,826 --> 00:20:01,326
you'll see at the top

446
00:19:57,826 --> 00:20:01,326
you'll see at the top

447
00:20:01,326 --> 00:20:02,976
and that means your channel

448
00:20:03,116 --> 00:20:04,556
You're starting, you're ready

449
00:20:04,556 --> 00:20:06,296
to start publishing

450
00:20:07,996 --> 00:20:09,656
And so once you're approved,

451
00:20:09,656 --> 00:20:12,526
that you're going to have more

452
00:20:12,806 --> 00:20:15,436
to RSS, to your RSS channel.

453
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:17,406
And so there are

454
00:20:17,406 --> 00:20:18,716
and some of these

455
00:20:18,716 --> 00:20:21,186
than the RSS sections.

456
00:20:21,956 --> 00:20:25,116
So one example is the

457
00:20:25,466 --> 00:20:28,096
You can see here that there

458
00:20:28,096 --> 00:20:29,626
that are associated

459
00:20:29,936 --> 00:20:31,236
You don't need your

460
00:20:31,236 --> 00:20:33,656
because Apple News format

461
00:20:33,656 --> 00:20:34,796
And, of course, you

462
00:20:34,796 --> 00:20:36,606
rename them here as

463
00:20:37,616 --> 00:20:40,516
We also have the

464
00:20:40,516 --> 00:20:42,346
and roles within Apple News.

465
00:20:42,346 --> 00:20:44,846
So if you work in a multi-person

466
00:20:44,846 --> 00:20:47,736
to invite new users,

467
00:20:47,736 --> 00:20:50,306
which has full access

468
00:20:50,356 --> 00:20:53,156
in News Publisher all the

469
00:20:53,436 --> 00:20:57,566
who only access analytics and

470
00:20:57,566 --> 00:20:58,776
who can only view

471
00:20:59,306 --> 00:21:00,146
So very powerful.

472
00:20:59,306 --> 00:21:00,146
So very powerful.

473
00:21:01,626 --> 00:21:04,236
So a few best practices when

474
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:06,516
First, you want to make sure

475
00:21:06,516 --> 00:21:07,306
subject matter.

476
00:21:07,306 --> 00:21:08,706
You want to avoid

477
00:21:08,706 --> 00:21:09,696
or misleading headlines.

478
00:21:09,696 --> 00:21:11,206
It's really not what

479
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:13,786
News is also not

480
00:21:13,786 --> 00:21:15,346
to be used as a marketing

481
00:21:15,756 --> 00:21:18,426
We really encourage you to

482
00:21:18,426 --> 00:21:21,366
to engage, inform,

483
00:21:22,486 --> 00:21:25,896
And then take advantage of

484
00:21:26,006 --> 00:21:30,486
So use things like the animation

485
00:21:30,486 --> 00:21:32,786
and imagery that

486
00:21:32,786 --> 00:21:34,556
and makes them come back

487
00:21:34,606 --> 00:21:37,096
And use analytics

488
00:21:37,096 --> 00:21:38,636
Pay attention to what

489
00:21:38,636 --> 00:21:40,806
and maybe they're reading a

490
00:21:40,806 --> 00:21:42,866
or a specific article that

491
00:21:43,126 --> 00:21:44,866
and they may want

492
00:21:44,866 --> 00:21:45,956
to write more articles

493
00:21:47,066 --> 00:21:48,386
Then, of course, you

494
00:21:48,386 --> 00:21:49,316
which we'll talk

495
00:21:50,126 --> 00:21:54,036
So three ways to get your

496
00:21:55,076 --> 00:21:58,496
One is web authoring,

497
00:21:58,496 --> 00:22:00,626
and the third is plug-ins.

498
00:21:58,496 --> 00:22:00,626
and the third is plug-ins.

499
00:22:02,046 --> 00:22:03,506
And so, first, let's

500
00:22:04,826 --> 00:22:07,746
So News Publisher supports

501
00:22:07,746 --> 00:22:08,706
authoring experience.

502
00:22:09,016 --> 00:22:10,896
The output's beautiful, simple,

503
00:22:10,896 --> 00:22:12,826
Apple News Format

504
00:22:12,826 --> 00:22:13,836
to your channel in News.

505
00:22:14,276 --> 00:22:15,476
So rather than showing

506
00:22:15,476 --> 00:22:17,976
let me show you a quick demo,

507
00:22:24,346 --> 00:22:27,556
Alright. So this is News

508
00:22:27,556 --> 00:22:29,306
to make a new Apple

509
00:22:29,936 --> 00:22:33,926
you can just click create

510
00:22:33,926 --> 00:22:35,236
in the authoring interface.

511
00:22:36,006 --> 00:22:37,496
And so just a quick

512
00:22:37,496 --> 00:22:39,556
We have our standard

513
00:22:39,796 --> 00:22:41,316
You have undo, redo.

514
00:22:41,316 --> 00:22:43,446
We have a styling palette

515
00:22:43,446 --> 00:22:44,826
and feel of each article.

516
00:22:45,486 --> 00:22:46,566
We have a Publish button

517
00:22:46,566 --> 00:22:48,586
that lets you publish

518
00:22:48,586 --> 00:22:51,786
We also have a Help Link up

519
00:22:51,786 --> 00:22:54,026
and very rich, very deep

520
00:22:54,026 --> 00:22:55,736
with publishing in Apple News.

521
00:22:56,526 --> 00:22:58,026
And then we've got

522
00:22:58,026 --> 00:22:59,946
and the content of

523
00:22:59,946 --> 00:23:02,486
So let's start off

524
00:22:59,946 --> 00:23:02,486
So let's start off

525
00:23:02,536 --> 00:23:03,956
So for our header

526
00:23:03,956 --> 00:23:06,266
to have an image

527
00:23:06,756 --> 00:23:08,356
You can have the

528
00:23:08,806 --> 00:23:11,696
or we can have a text-only

529
00:23:12,406 --> 00:23:14,086
So let's go and create

530
00:23:14,086 --> 00:23:15,986
that has a beautiful image.

531
00:23:17,046 --> 00:23:23,456
OK. And so let's go, and let's

532
00:23:26,866 --> 00:23:29,236
Alright. So that looks nice.

533
00:23:29,236 --> 00:23:35,516
Let's add a nice

534
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:41,156
Let's go to an extra space here,

535
00:23:41,746 --> 00:23:43,046
let's put that in

536
00:23:44,776 --> 00:23:46,186
And let's add some body text.

537
00:23:46,186 --> 00:23:48,376
Rather than typing it, just

538
00:23:50,036 --> 00:23:51,326
Alright. So now we've

539
00:23:51,326 --> 00:23:54,046
of a beautiful Apple

540
00:23:54,046 --> 00:23:55,236
So you can do a lot of things

541
00:23:55,236 --> 00:23:57,156
to make it really

542
00:23:57,156 --> 00:23:59,146
So it's really easy to

543
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:01,486
if we can just, let's

544
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:01,486
if we can just, let's

545
00:24:03,116 --> 00:24:06,686
and we can just select the text

546
00:24:06,686 --> 00:24:08,506
and then we get a

547
00:24:08,676 --> 00:24:11,626
We can just click the link

548
00:24:11,626 --> 00:24:13,486
hit OK, and we've got a link.

549
00:24:13,486 --> 00:24:16,206
And so you can also

550
00:24:16,206 --> 00:24:18,766
For example, if we

551
00:24:18,766 --> 00:24:20,316
we can make it italic.

552
00:24:20,616 --> 00:24:22,766
We can also make it bold.

553
00:24:22,766 --> 00:24:25,166
And so pull quotes are one

554
00:24:25,166 --> 00:24:27,176
about Apple News, and

555
00:24:27,256 --> 00:24:31,226
Let's grab a piece of text,

556
00:24:31,226 --> 00:24:34,076
and then if we select

557
00:24:34,076 --> 00:24:35,886
into a pull quote

558
00:24:36,276 --> 00:24:38,426
And so that really makes it

559
00:24:38,426 --> 00:24:42,106
Now let's do some, some work

560
00:24:42,106 --> 00:24:44,006
So if we click on

561
00:24:44,006 --> 00:24:46,456
we can very quickly jump

562
00:24:46,456 --> 00:24:47,186
Here's modern.

563
00:24:47,696 --> 00:24:49,656
A nice sanserif.

564
00:24:49,746 --> 00:24:53,876
Here's bold, and let's

565
00:24:53,876 --> 00:24:55,756
I think classic looks,

566
00:24:56,986 --> 00:24:59,386
OK, and let's mess around

567
00:24:59,386 --> 00:25:02,026
You can go with a darker

568
00:24:59,386 --> 00:25:02,026
You can go with a darker

569
00:25:02,856 --> 00:25:06,006
or you can try different

570
00:25:06,006 --> 00:25:07,106
since that looks pretty nice.

571
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:10,716
It's also really easy to add

572
00:25:11,076 --> 00:25:12,666
So we just grab a

573
00:25:12,666 --> 00:25:15,666
from the desktop and drag it in.

574
00:25:17,416 --> 00:25:23,866
The images pop right in, and

575
00:25:24,046 --> 00:25:25,486
just by typing right

576
00:25:25,486 --> 00:25:26,876
So that looks pretty good.

577
00:25:27,146 --> 00:25:28,346
I think we're ready to publish.

578
00:25:28,346 --> 00:25:30,616
So we can just go up

579
00:25:31,146 --> 00:25:33,176
and then remember what

580
00:25:33,176 --> 00:25:35,216
to your default section if you

581
00:25:35,216 --> 00:25:37,416
So let's publish it to Top

582
00:25:37,416 --> 00:25:40,206
and then let's also

583
00:25:40,206 --> 00:25:42,156
because that's what

584
00:25:42,456 --> 00:25:45,966
And we click publish, and

585
00:25:45,966 --> 00:25:46,716
into Apple News.

586
00:25:51,116 --> 00:25:53,496
Alright. So you can see

587
00:25:53,496 --> 00:25:56,486
and this is what the articles

588
00:25:56,946 --> 00:26:00,116
Beautiful, formatted

589
00:25:56,946 --> 00:26:00,116
Beautiful, formatted

590
00:26:00,396 --> 00:26:01,886
and iPad automatically.

591
00:26:01,886 --> 00:26:04,546
You can see at the

592
00:26:04,906 --> 00:26:07,116
from this channel

593
00:26:07,116 --> 00:26:08,116
to the end of this article.

594
00:26:08,766 --> 00:26:11,216
So a few things to think

595
00:26:11,216 --> 00:26:13,546
about when you're

596
00:26:13,846 --> 00:26:16,106
First, choose a striking

597
00:26:16,106 --> 00:26:18,036
Great imagery drives

598
00:26:18,556 --> 00:26:21,406
Use a consistent methodology

599
00:26:21,406 --> 00:26:22,876
You want to have an

600
00:26:22,876 --> 00:26:25,746
that you follow regularly

601
00:26:26,036 --> 00:26:27,846
Try to include images

602
00:26:27,846 --> 00:26:30,406
This is really true for any

603
00:26:30,856 --> 00:26:32,696
Use imagery and, and multimedia.

604
00:26:33,586 --> 00:26:35,886
Also try to use pull

605
00:26:35,886 --> 00:26:37,426
You know, use all of the

606
00:26:37,426 --> 00:26:38,086
in the authoring tool.

607
00:26:39,366 --> 00:26:40,476
Alright. So that's

608
00:26:40,476 --> 00:26:41,886
Let's talk a little

609
00:26:41,886 --> 00:26:43,366
We're just going to

610
00:26:43,796 --> 00:26:46,796
So Apple News offers

611
00:26:46,976 --> 00:26:49,346
This is great for medium

612
00:26:49,346 --> 00:26:50,776
with existing CMS'

613
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:52,796
to plug directly

614
00:26:53,736 --> 00:26:58,016
It provides functions like read,

615
00:26:59,176 --> 00:27:01,436
and also offers plug in support.

616
00:26:59,176 --> 00:27:01,436
and also offers plug in support.

617
00:27:01,436 --> 00:27:04,266
So if you want to

618
00:27:04,266 --> 00:27:06,966
if you have specific questions

619
00:27:06,966 --> 00:27:09,916
up with the Apple News

620
00:27:09,916 --> 00:27:13,866
that we have a lab today, and we

621
00:27:13,866 --> 00:27:15,916
We'll have Apple News

622
00:27:15,916 --> 00:27:17,456
to answer any questions

623
00:27:18,906 --> 00:27:20,936
Alright. Third, let's

624
00:27:20,936 --> 00:27:22,696
the third way you can get

625
00:27:23,676 --> 00:27:26,096
So WordPress is one of

626
00:27:26,096 --> 00:27:28,516
We actually offer

627
00:27:28,516 --> 00:27:31,416
and the published Apple News

628
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:34,666
to publish articles directly

629
00:27:34,666 --> 00:27:37,046
It's also one of the most

630
00:27:37,046 --> 00:27:37,656
have today.

631
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:40,546
And so this is what it

632
00:27:40,546 --> 00:27:44,346
As a, WordPress is a nice

633
00:27:44,446 --> 00:27:47,496
and there's an Apple News

634
00:27:47,496 --> 00:27:49,286
that gives you many

635
00:27:49,286 --> 00:27:51,636
in Apple News including

636
00:27:51,946 --> 00:27:54,056
adding a pull quote,

637
00:27:54,486 --> 00:27:56,376
So it's really simple

638
00:27:57,906 --> 00:28:00,806
We also support publishing

639
00:27:57,906 --> 00:28:00,806
We also support publishing

640
00:28:00,806 --> 00:28:03,326
which is a content

641
00:28:03,666 --> 00:28:07,636
that many websites that you

642
00:28:08,106 --> 00:28:10,296
And so you can publish directly

643
00:28:10,906 --> 00:28:15,886
And today we also announced that

644
00:28:15,886 --> 00:28:17,926
with Apple News, and

645
00:28:17,926 --> 00:28:18,696
from their system.

646
00:28:19,196 --> 00:28:19,966
It's very exciting.

647
00:28:19,966 --> 00:28:23,276
And then next, I'm really

648
00:28:23,276 --> 00:28:26,816
in this session that we have a

649
00:28:27,166 --> 00:28:30,296
with Squarespace.

650
00:28:30,846 --> 00:28:33,736
And so Squarespace,

651
00:28:33,736 --> 00:28:36,206
helps anyone build

652
00:28:36,646 --> 00:28:40,986
The Apple News integration lets

653
00:28:40,986 --> 00:28:43,866
seamlessly publish into Apple

654
00:28:43,866 --> 00:28:46,736
with the world, and, of

655
00:28:46,736 --> 00:28:48,846
it's really beautiful

656
00:28:48,846 --> 00:28:51,016
So, it's a really

657
00:28:51,046 --> 00:28:52,966
We're thrilled to, to

658
00:28:54,276 --> 00:28:57,646
So integrations of these four

659
00:28:57,646 --> 00:29:00,686
to publish into Apple News using

660
00:28:57,646 --> 00:29:00,686
to publish into Apple News using

661
00:29:00,686 --> 00:29:01,406
day instantly.

662
00:29:01,696 --> 00:29:02,986
So I really urge

663
00:29:02,986 --> 00:29:03,886
out if you use any of these.

664
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:09,086
So next let's talk about

665
00:29:09,086 --> 00:29:10,186
and channels in News.

666
00:29:11,236 --> 00:29:14,436
So News makes it really easy

667
00:29:15,046 --> 00:29:17,486
Now as a publisher,

668
00:29:17,486 --> 00:29:19,496
in a few key places

669
00:29:20,486 --> 00:29:23,516
in articles, and

670
00:29:24,216 --> 00:29:25,846
And so one of the great

671
00:29:25,846 --> 00:29:27,436
in Apple News are

672
00:29:28,066 --> 00:29:29,706
So if you sell your own ads,

673
00:29:29,766 --> 00:29:31,956
you get to keep 100

674
00:29:33,656 --> 00:29:36,136
And for the inventory

675
00:29:36,366 --> 00:29:39,956
you can have Apple backfill, and

676
00:29:40,506 --> 00:29:46,026
So it's a, a really great,

677
00:29:46,206 --> 00:29:50,116
One note, though, is that ads

678
00:29:50,116 --> 00:29:53,976
for articles delivered

679
00:29:54,186 --> 00:29:55,996
So a quick look at

680
00:29:55,996 --> 00:29:58,086
that are available

681
00:29:58,726 --> 00:30:04,676
So we've got standard, we've got

682
00:29:58,726 --> 00:30:04,676
So we've got standard, we've got

683
00:30:06,156 --> 00:30:08,976
mrects in articles,

684
00:30:09,246 --> 00:30:10,136
This is when you're swiping

685
00:30:10,136 --> 00:30:11,526
between articles

686
00:30:12,896 --> 00:30:16,596
We also have sponsored

687
00:30:18,576 --> 00:30:21,336
And then video ads, if

688
00:30:22,126 --> 00:30:24,316
and this is what they

689
00:30:24,406 --> 00:30:26,976
So they're really simple, and

690
00:30:27,886 --> 00:30:29,336
So a few things to think

691
00:30:29,336 --> 00:30:31,986
about when you're

692
00:30:32,336 --> 00:30:33,576
Avoid some common mistakes.

693
00:30:33,576 --> 00:30:35,546
Keeping, keeping an

694
00:30:35,546 --> 00:30:37,196
that you have for your ads.

695
00:30:37,196 --> 00:30:42,766
If, for example, you've booked

696
00:30:42,766 --> 00:30:44,656
and you have mrects

697
00:30:44,846 --> 00:30:47,026
Those, obviously, aren't going

698
00:30:47,026 --> 00:30:48,746
to make sure that you're not

699
00:30:48,746 --> 00:30:49,816
like that.

700
00:30:50,076 --> 00:30:54,446
You also should enable backfill

701
00:30:54,446 --> 00:30:56,716
on selling ads, but you should

702
00:30:56,716 --> 00:30:57,216
if you can.

703
00:30:57,596 --> 00:30:59,746
That's the best way to

704
00:31:01,346 --> 00:31:03,906
Also, we also give

705
00:31:03,906 --> 00:31:08,276
to exclude certain categories

706
00:31:08,656 --> 00:31:10,536
but if you exclude too

707
00:31:10,536 --> 00:31:14,376
up with too low of an ad

708
00:31:14,376 --> 00:31:17,546
where you need to so you don't

709
00:31:18,506 --> 00:31:21,426
You can also experiment

710
00:31:21,606 --> 00:31:23,546
We found out the larger ad

711
00:31:23,546 --> 00:31:24,336
click-through rates.

712
00:31:24,426 --> 00:31:26,676
So think about things

713
00:31:27,286 --> 00:31:29,176
And then consider video

714
00:31:29,176 --> 00:31:31,456
that users are engaging

715
00:31:32,616 --> 00:31:36,116
And so we have a tool that's

716
00:31:36,326 --> 00:31:37,466
which is called Workbench.

717
00:31:37,956 --> 00:31:40,326
And so you can do a couple

718
00:31:40,326 --> 00:31:42,166
First, you can monitor

719
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:44,506
for the campaigns you

720
00:31:44,506 --> 00:31:46,316
It's really easy to keep

721
00:31:46,316 --> 00:31:48,256
and you can also

722
00:31:48,256 --> 00:31:50,066
You can book, manage, report

723
00:31:50,336 --> 00:31:53,226
on individual campaigns

724
00:31:53,226 --> 00:31:55,706
It's a really simple

725
00:31:57,606 --> 00:31:59,536
Next, analytics and insight.

726
00:32:00,106 --> 00:32:03,576
So we offer powerful

727
00:32:03,846 --> 00:32:05,336
Once you've started

728
00:32:05,336 --> 00:32:07,196
you can get some great insight

729
00:32:07,196 --> 00:32:08,816
on how your content

730
00:32:08,816 --> 00:32:10,536
which articles are doing

731
00:32:10,536 --> 00:32:13,116
how your traffic

732
00:32:13,116 --> 00:32:15,616
It's a really great

733
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:17,186
for Apple News Format

734
00:32:17,586 --> 00:32:20,636
We offer a dashboard that gives

735
00:32:20,746 --> 00:32:23,986
on the content performance,

736
00:32:23,986 --> 00:32:25,746
you can download the

737
00:32:27,166 --> 00:32:29,026
but Apple News Format only.

738
00:32:29,666 --> 00:32:32,516
This is what the analytics

739
00:32:32,516 --> 00:32:35,366
This is a view of channel data,

740
00:32:35,366 --> 00:32:38,246
and so you can see these are

741
00:32:38,246 --> 00:32:42,846
particular channel has over

742
00:32:43,986 --> 00:32:45,566
So it's a really nice,

743
00:32:45,566 --> 00:32:48,506
some sense at a glance of

744
00:32:48,786 --> 00:32:50,686
You can even see at

745
00:32:50,686 --> 00:32:54,006
a list of the best performing

746
00:32:54,006 --> 00:32:56,166
which you can sort

747
00:32:57,806 --> 00:33:01,776
And here's a chart for,

748
00:32:57,806 --> 00:33:01,776
And here's a chart for,

749
00:33:01,776 --> 00:33:04,996
and so this one shows shares

750
00:33:04,996 --> 00:33:07,056
that they're split up

751
00:33:07,116 --> 00:33:09,896
So you can really get a sense if

752
00:33:09,896 --> 00:33:12,076
or Twitter or messages or mail,

753
00:33:12,266 --> 00:33:14,056
and that can help you

754
00:33:15,616 --> 00:33:19,376
And then, of course, if you have

755
00:33:19,376 --> 00:33:22,466
and you want to pull the

756
00:33:22,586 --> 00:33:24,156
you can download the CSV

757
00:33:24,156 --> 00:33:26,826
from the analytics tab

758
00:33:30,976 --> 00:33:34,306
So we've talked about a lot of

759
00:33:34,306 --> 00:33:35,306
Let's talk a little bit

760
00:33:35,306 --> 00:33:37,496
about how you can make

761
00:33:37,716 --> 00:33:38,406
in Apple News.

762
00:33:39,386 --> 00:33:41,886
So there are lots of ways

763
00:33:41,886 --> 00:33:42,516
to your channel.

764
00:33:42,516 --> 00:33:45,216
We're going to cover

765
00:33:45,386 --> 00:33:47,516
So, first, you, you want

766
00:33:47,516 --> 00:33:49,226
from wherever you can

767
00:33:49,806 --> 00:33:51,896
Use the promoted articles

768
00:33:52,586 --> 00:33:57,066
And then use conical URL's,

769
00:33:57,066 --> 00:33:58,266
that is in a minute, too.

770
00:33:59,856 --> 00:34:02,466
And, in addition, we have a link

771
00:33:59,856 --> 00:34:02,466
And, in addition, we have a link

772
00:34:02,466 --> 00:34:04,356
to our Marketing

773
00:34:04,646 --> 00:34:06,606
There's lots of information

774
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:09,016
can promote your

775
00:34:11,366 --> 00:34:13,286
So getting the word out about

776
00:34:13,286 --> 00:34:15,496
and make it really easy to

777
00:34:15,916 --> 00:34:18,326
you just go into News Publisher

778
00:34:18,426 --> 00:34:20,085
see that there's a

779
00:34:20,315 --> 00:34:22,886
So you click on that, and

780
00:34:22,886 --> 00:34:23,946
where you can just

781
00:34:24,266 --> 00:34:25,485
and then share it

782
00:34:27,126 --> 00:34:30,335
So we also have a

783
00:34:30,916 --> 00:34:33,025
and so what this does is

784
00:34:33,025 --> 00:34:35,896
it will ensure that every user

785
00:34:35,896 --> 00:34:37,356
of your channel when

786
00:34:37,356 --> 00:34:40,326
And then when they come back,

787
00:34:40,326 --> 00:34:43,045
down as you deliver more

788
00:34:43,045 --> 00:34:45,795
that everyone sees it at the top

789
00:34:46,036 --> 00:34:50,076
And it also, make sure it

790
00:34:50,076 --> 00:34:52,565
at the bottom of articles

791
00:34:53,176 --> 00:34:56,976
You can promote up to

792
00:34:57,746 --> 00:34:58,976
It's really easy to promote.

793
00:34:58,976 --> 00:35:03,756
You just click on the little

794
00:34:58,976 --> 00:35:03,756
You just click on the little

795
00:35:03,826 --> 00:35:08,006
and then it moves up to the

796
00:35:08,006 --> 00:35:09,026
in News Publisher.

797
00:35:09,096 --> 00:35:11,386
So you can always see what you

798
00:35:12,046 --> 00:35:15,506
So a great way to add some

799
00:35:16,856 --> 00:35:18,386
Alright. So, finally,

800
00:35:18,756 --> 00:35:20,856
It's really easy

801
00:35:21,016 --> 00:35:23,396
You can just swipe

802
00:35:23,716 --> 00:35:25,356
In iOS10, we've made

803
00:35:25,356 --> 00:35:28,106
You can, we have a share

804
00:35:28,136 --> 00:35:30,996
So users will be sharing a

805
00:35:30,996 --> 00:35:33,916
that users can get to your,

806
00:35:33,916 --> 00:35:35,036
which platform they're on.

807
00:35:36,126 --> 00:35:39,276
And so conical URL's are

808
00:35:39,276 --> 00:35:40,806
to your original website.

809
00:35:40,866 --> 00:35:45,116
So if you have a website, and a

810
00:35:45,346 --> 00:35:48,626
if you included a conical URL

811
00:35:49,006 --> 00:35:52,706
if a user visits that link on

812
00:35:53,006 --> 00:35:56,166
it will redirect them to Safari

813
00:35:56,676 --> 00:35:57,876
So it's a great way to make sure

814
00:35:57,876 --> 00:36:00,546
that users can read your

815
00:35:57,876 --> 00:36:00,546
that users can read your

816
00:36:01,896 --> 00:36:03,936
they're on.

817
00:36:04,036 --> 00:36:06,026
And so it falls back

818
00:36:06,406 --> 00:36:08,816
And this is an example

819
00:36:08,816 --> 00:36:11,236
and then its accompanying

820
00:36:12,816 --> 00:36:17,036
If you don't have a conical

821
00:36:17,036 --> 00:36:19,036
which isn't an ideal screen.

822
00:36:19,346 --> 00:36:20,706
And so if you do have a website,

823
00:36:21,226 --> 00:36:22,986
you should include

824
00:36:22,986 --> 00:36:26,906
so users can view

825
00:36:26,986 --> 00:36:30,346
Alright. So some of the

826
00:36:30,416 --> 00:36:32,086
for publishing in Apple News.

827
00:36:32,426 --> 00:36:33,836
Write great stuff.

828
00:36:33,836 --> 00:36:37,546
Try to check for errors and

829
00:36:37,546 --> 00:36:40,216
If you have errors or

830
00:36:40,216 --> 00:36:41,616
it makes it harder

831
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:42,836
and then recommend it to users.

832
00:36:43,456 --> 00:36:46,316
So really make sure you're

833
00:36:46,316 --> 00:36:46,706
you can.

834
00:36:47,226 --> 00:36:50,156
Deliver high-resolution

835
00:36:50,516 --> 00:36:53,946
Nothing drives engagement

836
00:36:54,496 --> 00:36:57,166
Use Rich Text and pull quotes,

837
00:36:57,166 --> 00:36:58,706
Anything else that Apple

838
00:36:58,706 --> 00:36:59,676
and be creative.

839
00:36:59,676 --> 00:37:02,546
There are so many interesting

840
00:36:59,676 --> 00:37:02,546
There are so many interesting

841
00:37:02,796 --> 00:37:05,156
Dig around in the documentation,

842
00:37:05,536 --> 00:37:08,856
We really recommend that you

843
00:37:09,026 --> 00:37:09,616
great articles.

844
00:37:09,616 --> 00:37:12,856
And then use Apple.News

845
00:37:12,986 --> 00:37:14,686
but use conical URL's

846
00:37:15,406 --> 00:37:18,376
And then we also recommend

847
00:37:18,376 --> 00:37:21,936
publishing cadence so

848
00:37:22,146 --> 00:37:23,856
if you're publishing

849
00:37:24,166 --> 00:37:25,136
They'll come back

850
00:37:25,136 --> 00:37:26,346
on a regular basis as well.

851
00:37:28,216 --> 00:37:32,676
And so Apple News is very much

852
00:37:32,916 --> 00:37:36,686
beautiful, and inspired stories,

853
00:37:36,686 --> 00:37:40,286
on the Apple News team, the

854
00:37:40,286 --> 00:37:43,046
and look for amazing

855
00:37:43,326 --> 00:37:44,876
They're looking for the

856
00:37:45,466 --> 00:37:47,886
and so we encourage you to

857
00:37:47,886 --> 00:37:48,806
with what you publish,

858
00:37:48,806 --> 00:37:51,556
and if you're doing great

859
00:37:51,556 --> 00:37:54,356
stories, our editors may notice,

860
00:37:54,356 --> 00:37:55,436
and help you find

861
00:37:55,436 --> 00:37:57,006
that you wouldn't

862
00:37:57,006 --> 00:37:59,886
So a few places we do

863
00:38:00,516 --> 00:38:03,826
in our new Featured

864
00:38:04,416 --> 00:38:08,556
in the Explore tab, in the

865
00:38:08,986 --> 00:38:11,656
We also have an Apple News

866
00:38:11,656 --> 00:38:12,766
out some of the best articles

867
00:38:12,766 --> 00:38:14,166
that have been published

868
00:38:14,376 --> 00:38:17,466
and then we have a weekly

869
00:38:17,466 --> 00:38:21,026
many users, and it's another

870
00:38:22,616 --> 00:38:24,786
So some homework to do.

871
00:38:25,336 --> 00:38:27,946
So first you want to sign

872
00:38:28,406 --> 00:38:31,296
create a channel, and then start

873
00:38:31,756 --> 00:38:36,196
your CMS via the Apple News API,

874
00:38:36,946 --> 00:38:39,646
or you can author

875
00:38:43,126 --> 00:38:45,256
So this is more information

876
00:38:45,666 --> 00:38:49,366
and other places

877
00:38:50,186 --> 00:38:53,656
And then there's also a

878
00:38:53,986 --> 00:38:56,356
This is an amazing session

879
00:38:56,356 --> 00:38:59,426
to create incredible Apple

880
00:38:59,516 --> 00:39:01,996
So I can't recommend this

881
00:38:59,516 --> 00:39:01,996
So I can't recommend this

882
00:39:02,056 --> 00:39:05,026
Casey and Dan will help

883
00:39:05,346 --> 00:39:07,566
that really engage and

884
00:39:07,566 --> 00:39:08,596
They use some really cool stuff.

885
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:10,616
So I highly recommend

886
00:39:10,756 --> 00:39:12,786
So thanks, and I hope you're

887
00:39:13,516 --> 00:39:16,000
