[ Applause ]

4
00:00:28,046 --> 00:00:31,216
Thank you for attending this

5
00:00:31,286 --> 00:00:33,496
I'm an internationalization

6
00:00:33,786 --> 00:00:36,456
and today with my

7
00:00:36,456 --> 00:00:39,096
we're going to talk about

8
00:00:39,406 --> 00:00:40,236
So let's get started.

9
00:00:40,896 --> 00:00:46,876
At Apple we support over 40

10
00:00:47,366 --> 00:00:50,416
and every language has its

11
00:00:50,416 --> 00:00:53,686
in particular, we are going to

12
00:00:53,686 --> 00:00:55,246
to left languages

13
00:00:55,676 --> 00:00:57,786
which are Arabic and Hebrew.

14
00:00:58,536 --> 00:01:01,166
So this language has

15
00:00:58,536 --> 00:01:01,166
So this language has

16
00:01:01,776 --> 00:01:05,736
in building your apps and

17
00:01:05,736 --> 00:01:06,936
of the writing direction.

18
00:01:07,566 --> 00:01:10,166
So why are we talking about

19
00:01:10,736 --> 00:01:15,156
With over 400 million

20
00:01:15,446 --> 00:01:16,976
this really is a growing market.

21
00:01:17,626 --> 00:01:20,516
So just last year, we

22
00:01:20,516 --> 00:01:24,186
in the UAE these are images

23
00:01:25,336 --> 00:01:32,056
Dubai and just few weeks ago,

24
00:01:32,246 --> 00:01:33,716
in Arabic for the first time.

25
00:01:34,006 --> 00:01:37,756
This is really, really exciting,

26
00:01:38,516 --> 00:01:43,136
As a developer, you have growth

27
00:01:43,736 --> 00:01:45,216
and designing word ready apps

28
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:47,706
for your customers

29
00:01:48,446 --> 00:01:50,966
So in this session we're mainly

30
00:01:50,966 --> 00:01:54,596
to left languages, but if you

31
00:01:54,596 --> 00:01:57,316
about designing word ready

32
00:01:57,586 --> 00:01:59,936

and Internationalization Best

36
00:02:05,366 --> 00:02:06,676
about internationalization.

37
00:02:08,096 --> 00:02:13,546
Last year, on iOS 9 we extended

38
00:02:13,546 --> 00:02:16,116
to fully support languages

39
00:02:16,526 --> 00:02:20,126
And just after that, we

40
00:02:20,126 --> 00:02:23,536
and Arabic localizations

41
00:02:24,516 --> 00:02:27,916
This year I'm happy to say

42
00:02:27,916 --> 00:02:30,456
on redesigning macOS

43
00:02:31,476 --> 00:02:33,926
So now, I would like to

44
00:02:34,866 --> 00:02:37,486
the agenda to see what we

45
00:02:38,526 --> 00:02:41,986
So first, Joaquim is going

46
00:02:41,986 --> 00:02:45,826
of the APIs we introduced last

47
00:02:45,826 --> 00:02:48,926
about what's new in iOS

48
00:02:48,926 --> 00:02:52,886
and how you can evaluate

49
00:02:54,236 --> 00:02:58,126
He will finish up with

50
00:02:58,456 --> 00:03:02,986
I am going to talk about what's

51
00:02:58,456 --> 00:03:02,986
I am going to talk about what's

52
00:03:02,986 --> 00:03:06,696
in text support and how can you

53
00:03:06,696 --> 00:03:08,276
correctly in your applications.

54
00:03:08,726 --> 00:03:11,276
And with that, I'm going

55
00:03:11,416 --> 00:03:13,846
to talk about iOS, Joaquim.

57
00:03:18,046 --> 00:03:20,106
&gt;&gt; Alright, thank you

58
00:03:20,206 --> 00:03:21,136
Thank you all for coming.

59
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:24,716
So, my name is Joaquim,

60
00:03:24,806 --> 00:03:27,286
by talking about iOS.

61
00:03:27,466 --> 00:03:32,976
So as Sara mentioned, last year

62
00:03:32,976 --> 00:03:36,746
to left UISupport on iOS 9

63
00:03:36,996 --> 00:03:40,166
When your users run their apps

64
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:43,186
in these languages they

65
00:03:43,396 --> 00:03:44,856
to the nature of

66
00:03:45,336 --> 00:03:49,596
UIKit does a lot of the work

67
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:51,676
and views do the correct

68
00:03:51,676 --> 00:03:53,036
in a right to left context.

69
00:03:54,576 --> 00:03:57,366
Managing the layout between

70
00:03:57,366 --> 00:03:57,946
auto layout.

71
00:03:58,006 --> 00:04:00,216
And this can either

72
00:03:58,006 --> 00:04:00,216
And this can either

73
00:04:00,216 --> 00:04:03,656
such as UIStack view new in iOS

74
00:04:04,706 --> 00:04:08,766
which lets you easily model

75
00:04:09,376 --> 00:04:10,866
of easy to use horizontal

76
00:04:10,866 --> 00:04:12,456
and vertical groups

77
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:15,496
And the nice thing

78
00:04:15,496 --> 00:04:17,836
that it manages auto

79
00:04:18,736 --> 00:04:20,836
And in particular, for right

80
00:04:20,836 --> 00:04:23,406
to left languages it manages

81
00:04:23,406 --> 00:04:25,956
and what these are, are

82
00:04:26,296 --> 00:04:29,746
that change automatically to

83
00:04:29,746 --> 00:04:30,966
in a right to left context.

84
00:04:33,296 --> 00:04:36,976
Having said that, it's

85
00:04:36,976 --> 00:04:39,326
because these languages are

86
00:04:39,326 --> 00:04:42,286
to left, this doesn't mean

87
00:04:42,286 --> 00:04:45,536
in an aspect of your app should

88
00:04:45,536 --> 00:04:46,806
direction of these languages.

89
00:04:47,376 --> 00:04:50,776
There are nuances and some

90
00:04:50,776 --> 00:04:52,596
when designing for

91
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:56,576
So one example up above is

92
00:04:56,576 --> 00:05:01,076
to playback such as rewind and

93
00:04:56,576 --> 00:05:01,076
to playback such as rewind and

94
00:05:01,076 --> 00:05:03,226
timeline scrubbers, these

95
00:05:03,226 --> 00:05:06,976
across layout direction.

96
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:09,676
Another example is

97
00:05:09,836 --> 00:05:12,106
this can either refer

98
00:05:12,106 --> 00:05:15,006
that don't have a specific

99
00:05:15,006 --> 00:05:17,846
to them, things like left

100
00:05:17,846 --> 00:05:19,236
which should obviously stay

101
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:21,756
in the same position

102
00:05:22,126 --> 00:05:24,316
And also the example above

103
00:05:24,346 --> 00:05:26,476
so things that have a physical

104
00:05:26,476 --> 00:05:29,426
or geographical correspondence

105
00:05:29,426 --> 00:05:32,346
north, east and west don't

106
00:05:33,006 --> 00:05:37,506
On iOS we have semantic content

107
00:05:37,836 --> 00:05:41,136
and in turn, determine and

108
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:43,006
of individual views

109
00:05:43,836 --> 00:05:46,826
This exposes an enum it's

110
00:05:46,826 --> 00:05:49,566
like I said before, and

111
00:05:49,566 --> 00:05:51,466
that I just mentioned,

112
00:05:51,956 --> 00:05:55,866
one for spatial UI, we have

113
00:05:55,866 --> 00:05:58,626
cases as well, in

114
00:05:58,626 --> 00:05:59,906
which is the default value.

115
00:05:59,986 --> 00:06:02,876
And this is probably where most

116
00:05:59,986 --> 00:06:02,876
And this is probably where most

117
00:06:03,486 --> 00:06:09,066
So, if you want to look

118
00:06:09,066 --> 00:06:11,986
and if you're also new to right

119
00:06:11,986 --> 00:06:14,646
I highly recommend you check

120
00:06:14,726 --> 00:06:16,966
New UIKit Ssupport

121
00:06:17,316 --> 00:06:19,616
It goes into all of these

122
00:06:19,616 --> 00:06:22,936
and also talks about some of

123
00:06:22,936 --> 00:06:26,806
some of the API we added in

124
00:06:27,486 --> 00:06:30,176
So that's a recap of what

125
00:06:30,176 --> 00:06:33,866
for layout, and with that I'd

126
00:06:34,976 --> 00:06:38,236
So images for right to left are

127
00:06:38,236 --> 00:06:40,116
to fall into one of

128
00:06:41,946 --> 00:06:46,056
The first one is universal

129
00:06:46,056 --> 00:06:49,096
where most of your images will

130
00:06:49,096 --> 00:06:52,286
or icons, and they don't need

131
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:54,536
for any language or

132
00:06:54,536 --> 00:06:58,336
So they just stay the same, this

133
00:06:58,786 --> 00:07:01,816
as regular UIImage or

134
00:06:58,786 --> 00:07:01,816
as regular UIImage or

135
00:07:01,816 --> 00:07:02,516
and Interface Builder.

136
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:06,756
The second category is images

137
00:07:06,756 --> 00:07:09,286
that do have the direction

138
00:07:09,566 --> 00:07:12,646
So whether this is

139
00:07:12,646 --> 00:07:16,396
of navigation arrows such as the

140
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:19,806
or the detail disclosure

141
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:22,516
on UITableView cells,

142
00:07:22,516 --> 00:07:24,546
a simplified representation

143
00:07:25,016 --> 00:07:26,886
these should be mirrored

144
00:07:26,886 --> 00:07:29,626
And simply flipping the image

145
00:07:29,986 --> 00:07:32,306
for right to left, so in this

146
00:07:32,306 --> 00:07:35,176
and now bullets are

147
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:39,286
On iOS you can do this

148
00:07:39,286 --> 00:07:42,716
LeftLlayoutDirection, we

149
00:07:42,896 --> 00:07:45,196
and the object returned

150
00:07:45,196 --> 00:07:48,186
in the UIImage view, does the

151
00:07:48,446 --> 00:07:50,426
if it's running in a

152
00:07:53,016 --> 00:07:56,536
Lastly, the third

153
00:07:56,536 --> 00:07:59,746
that do have the direction

154
00:07:59,986 --> 00:08:01,816
they are relatively complex

155
00:07:59,986 --> 00:08:01,816
they are relatively complex

156
00:08:01,846 --> 00:08:04,736
such that simply flipping

157
00:08:04,826 --> 00:08:07,016
incorrect result

158
00:08:07,386 --> 00:08:09,366
So in this case I have

159
00:08:09,966 --> 00:08:11,746
but instead of bullets

160
00:08:11,746 --> 00:08:14,116
and when I flip the image

161
00:08:14,116 --> 00:08:16,866
in the correct place,

162
00:08:17,036 --> 00:08:18,406
and they should actually

163
00:08:18,406 --> 00:08:19,736
in this example for

164
00:08:20,556 --> 00:08:24,036
So really what I need here is

165
00:08:24,036 --> 00:08:25,566
one for each layout direction.

166
00:08:25,566 --> 00:08:28,646
So I can fine-tune my

167
00:08:28,746 --> 00:08:30,216
and now it's displaying

168
00:08:31,096 --> 00:08:32,616
but now I have two

169
00:08:32,616 --> 00:08:35,535
And up until now the way

170
00:08:35,535 --> 00:08:36,736
to display the correct one

171
00:08:36,736 --> 00:08:38,916
at runtime is really

172
00:08:39,346 --> 00:08:42,256
You would use our semantic

173
00:08:42,256 --> 00:08:44,956
for your layout direction and

174
00:08:44,956 --> 00:08:49,216
from your bundle at runtime.

175
00:08:49,216 --> 00:08:51,626
On iOS 10 we're changing

176
00:08:52,336 --> 00:08:55,046
and we're starting with the

177
00:08:55,046 --> 00:08:56,436
for right to left

178
00:08:57,276 --> 00:08:59,666
And with it we're

179
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:01,416
that will let you do all three

180
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:01,416
that will let you do all three

181
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:04,756
of these things using

182
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:06,496
or image names in

183

184
00:09:10,436 --> 00:09:12,566
in Xcode 8 for your

185
00:09:13,266 --> 00:09:14,886
Thank you.

[ Applause ]

187
00:09:18,046 --> 00:09:19,556
So, what does this mean?

188
00:09:20,146 --> 00:09:24,076
So your image assets, in Xcode,

189
00:09:24,076 --> 00:09:27,056
and a new property that you

190
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:30,296
and the values that you

191
00:09:30,296 --> 00:09:31,726
that I mentioned in

192
00:09:31,726 --> 00:09:34,576
So an image can either

193
00:09:35,136 --> 00:09:38,576
you can specify also

194
00:09:38,576 --> 00:09:40,966
for one layout direction

195
00:09:40,966 --> 00:09:43,266
for the other, either from

196
00:09:43,266 --> 00:09:46,176
to left or vice versa.

197
00:09:46,346 --> 00:09:49,336
Or you can simply specify

198
00:09:49,336 --> 00:09:51,706
in your asset catalogs,

199
00:09:52,326 --> 00:09:56,496
Now these are image assets and

200
00:09:56,496 --> 00:09:59,776
with the technology for other

201
00:09:59,776 --> 00:10:03,036
such as different

202
00:09:59,776 --> 00:10:03,036
such as different

203
00:10:03,036 --> 00:10:04,426
across different platforms.

204
00:10:04,966 --> 00:10:07,806
So really this is the same

205
00:10:07,836 --> 00:10:10,546
to do is either set an

206
00:10:10,896 --> 00:10:15,866
or load it using

207
00:10:16,046 --> 00:10:19,896
And with that, I'd love

208
00:10:20,296 --> 00:10:26,096
Alright so, so I have

209
00:10:26,736 --> 00:10:30,236
and let me just run it once

210
00:10:31,156 --> 00:10:35,886
It's called Flags and in

211
00:10:35,886 --> 00:10:38,816
of course it's a

212
00:10:39,326 --> 00:10:42,746
So, this is pretty

213
00:10:42,746 --> 00:10:44,466
it's a lot of fun in groups,

214
00:10:44,546 --> 00:10:47,926
and what you can see

215
00:10:47,926 --> 00:10:50,246
So I've got here the

216
00:10:50,546 --> 00:10:52,356
and I have a Reveal

217
00:10:52,356 --> 00:10:54,586
does anybody know what

218
00:10:55,086 --> 00:10:57,816
I know it's Friday,

219
00:10:58,086 --> 00:10:59,036
Yeah, alright, I heard,

220
00:10:59,376 --> 00:11:00,946
I'm hearing France a

221
00:10:59,376 --> 00:11:00,946
I'm hearing France a

222
00:11:01,196 --> 00:11:03,196
Okay, so thank you.

223
00:11:03,196 --> 00:11:07,866
We also have two arrows,

224
00:11:08,296 --> 00:11:10,236
for the next question

225
00:11:10,636 --> 00:11:14,246
And this is all done using

226
00:11:14,246 --> 00:11:16,076
and this is a vertical

227
00:11:16,406 --> 00:11:18,206
Anybody know what this one is?

228
00:11:18,716 --> 00:11:22,106
Oh, wow, okay, awesome,

229
00:11:22,806 --> 00:11:25,496
Sweet, yeah, that's my

230
00:11:25,586 --> 00:11:26,666
you get the idea, right?

231
00:11:27,556 --> 00:11:31,506
So, I'm thinking of adding right

232
00:11:32,236 --> 00:11:35,646
Now I don't speak a word of

233
00:11:35,646 --> 00:11:38,276
to be written and read in

234
00:11:38,276 --> 00:11:40,896
to see how my app would

235
00:11:41,676 --> 00:11:43,536
Xcode allows me to

236
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,766
to left environment

237
00:11:45,766 --> 00:11:50,996
So all I have to do is go to

238
00:11:50,996 --> 00:11:53,086
and edit the scheme

239
00:11:54,146 --> 00:11:57,146
So this drops down

240
00:11:57,316 --> 00:11:59,086
I have Options tab

241
00:12:00,156 --> 00:12:03,706
And over here I have an

242
00:12:04,596 --> 00:12:07,076
So this lists my

243
00:12:07,076 --> 00:12:08,316
which are just English

244
00:12:08,316 --> 00:12:11,006
but I could also pick a right

245
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:13,636
What this is going to do

246
00:12:13,946 --> 00:12:17,506
in my development language which

247
00:12:17,506 --> 00:12:19,316
to make the UI think

248
00:12:19,316 --> 00:12:20,886
in a right to left environment.

249
00:12:21,406 --> 00:12:26,906
So I can just do that,

250
00:12:31,536 --> 00:12:33,296
Yep. So let me start

251
00:12:33,536 --> 00:12:35,596
So already we're seeing

252
00:12:35,596 --> 00:12:37,546
the navigation bar is

253
00:12:37,546 --> 00:12:40,086
it's showing the Back

254
00:12:41,336 --> 00:12:43,636
And my UI largely

255
00:12:43,876 --> 00:12:45,446
except you might

256
00:12:45,446 --> 00:12:47,026
that the arrows are now pointing

257
00:12:47,026 --> 00:12:49,136
at each other which,

258
00:12:49,716 --> 00:12:52,526
They're actually in the

259
00:12:52,526 --> 00:12:54,456
on the left, which is

260
00:12:54,896 --> 00:12:57,366
But the images themselves

261
00:12:57,596 --> 00:12:59,346
so I need to do that.

262
00:12:59,966 --> 00:13:02,906
Now all I have to do in Xcode

263
00:12:59,966 --> 00:13:02,906
Now all I have to do in Xcode

264
00:13:03,096 --> 00:13:04,976
so I'm going to go ahead

265
00:13:05,546 --> 00:13:09,536
And you'll notice that I

266
00:13:09,596 --> 00:13:11,826
one for the back arrow,

267
00:13:12,086 --> 00:13:15,056
And I'm going to go

268
00:13:15,056 --> 00:13:17,976
and select this new

269
00:13:17,976 --> 00:13:21,186
of it being a fixed image,

270
00:13:21,406 --> 00:13:23,826
that mirrors for the

271
00:13:24,116 --> 00:13:29,726
I'm going to go do the same

272
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:30,876
just so you can see that,

273
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:33,536
left to right mirrors

274
00:13:33,626 --> 00:13:35,836
And now let me just

275
00:13:38,516 --> 00:13:41,206
and see how it looks like.

276
00:13:47,216 --> 00:13:48,446
Cool, let's start the game.

277
00:13:49,076 --> 00:13:51,136
Alright, that's all I had to do

278
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:54,586
to now completely

279
00:13:54,586 --> 00:13:56,846
This is without an

280
00:13:56,846 --> 00:13:59,096
of code dedicated

281
00:13:59,096 --> 00:14:03,086
Auto layout, stack views and

282
00:13:59,096 --> 00:14:03,086
Auto layout, stack views and

283
00:14:03,086 --> 00:14:04,736
lifting for you at runtime.

284
00:14:05,056 --> 00:14:07,846
And by the way, I forgot to

285
00:14:07,846 --> 00:14:12,446
by a page controller that

286
00:14:12,446 --> 00:14:14,566
for going forward and

287
00:14:14,566 --> 00:14:15,486
to worry about that either.

288
00:14:16,326 --> 00:14:22,126
So that's the demo on image

289
00:14:24,236 --> 00:14:26,886
Cool. So that's a brief

290
00:14:26,886 --> 00:14:28,146
in the new direction support.

291
00:14:29,366 --> 00:14:32,416
Now you can also do all of this

292
00:14:32,596 --> 00:14:35,366
if your images are not

293
00:14:35,366 --> 00:14:37,036
and say you're fetching

294
00:14:37,096 --> 00:14:39,376
that you know has a

295
00:14:39,456 --> 00:14:41,406
and you want display on your UI.

296
00:14:42,396 --> 00:14:44,016
So this is for images

297
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:46,486
you can associate these

298
00:14:46,526 --> 00:14:47,166
in UIKit.

299
00:14:49,056 --> 00:14:51,526
We also have the

300
00:14:51,526 --> 00:14:54,406
that lets you specify that

301
00:14:54,406 --> 00:14:56,356
of another and that

302
00:14:56,806 --> 00:14:59,126
for adding to an image asset.

303
00:15:00,146 --> 00:15:02,736
It's called imageWith

304
00:15:03,116 --> 00:15:06,626
and it's probably simpler if

305
00:15:07,466 --> 00:15:10,646
So here it is and all I have

306
00:15:11,686 --> 00:15:14,286
in this particular example I'm

307
00:15:14,286 --> 00:15:15,816
from the remote source,

308
00:15:17,046 --> 00:15:19,486
And my right to left image

309
00:15:19,786 --> 00:15:22,236
but horizontally flipped and

310
00:15:22,536 --> 00:15:23,346
on UIImage.

311
00:15:24,876 --> 00:15:27,186
Then just register each image,

312
00:15:27,316 --> 00:15:30,076
one for each layout direction

313
00:15:30,566 --> 00:15:32,296
for left to right

314
00:15:32,856 --> 00:15:38,696
And then really you might

315
00:15:38,696 --> 00:15:41,936
that is similar to this, you

316
00:15:41,936 --> 00:15:44,826
with a trait collection

317
00:15:44,826 --> 00:15:46,296
And this probably doesn't

318
00:15:46,296 --> 00:15:49,526
because once again, it's the

319
00:15:49,526 --> 00:15:51,986
directionality property

320
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:58,266
So that's directional images,

321
00:15:58,266 --> 00:16:00,366
and also watchOS and macOS.

322
00:15:58,266 --> 00:16:00,366
and also watchOS and macOS.

323
00:16:01,706 --> 00:16:04,646
We have a new trait which

324
00:16:04,646 --> 00:16:08,776
as you saw before, this is a

325
00:16:08,776 --> 00:16:11,326
and because this is a new trait,

326
00:16:11,326 --> 00:16:14,466
in mind when it comes to

327
00:16:14,466 --> 00:16:16,386
on iOS with this new concept.

328
00:16:17,206 --> 00:16:19,766
So let's say just as a very

329
00:16:19,766 --> 00:16:22,566
subclass and I'm doing

330
00:16:22,566 --> 00:16:24,746
on layout sub views,

331
00:16:24,746 --> 00:16:26,166
by this very simple blue box.

332
00:16:28,076 --> 00:16:31,026
This is informed by semantic

333
00:16:31,026 --> 00:16:32,486
should be left to

334
00:16:32,966 --> 00:16:34,926
and you can use our

335
00:16:35,556 --> 00:16:37,386
Now if this is unspecified,

336
00:16:37,786 --> 00:16:40,756
semantic content attribute can

337
00:16:40,756 --> 00:16:43,146
and this can either be

338
00:16:43,616 --> 00:16:44,936
which has a trait collection,

339
00:16:45,276 --> 00:16:48,446
or the app's general user

340
00:16:49,996 --> 00:16:54,136
Now really, your UIView should

341
00:16:54,136 --> 00:16:56,426
about whether or not it should

342
00:16:56,426 --> 00:16:57,726
to left, that's it, right.

343
00:16:57,726 --> 00:16:59,666
And this can get pretty

344
00:17:00,616 --> 00:17:03,816
So I'm happy to say that

345
00:17:03,816 --> 00:17:07,146
that by using this new

346
00:17:07,146 --> 00:17:09,396
it's a computed property

347
00:17:09,396 --> 00:17:12,596
LayoutDirection and it takes all

348
00:17:12,915 --> 00:17:14,906
and tells you immediately

349
00:17:14,906 --> 00:17:17,306
yourself out in left to

350
00:17:17,876 --> 00:17:22,945
If you're not using UIKit or

351
00:17:22,945 --> 00:17:25,935
for your drawing, say you have

352
00:17:25,935 --> 00:17:28,346
or a SpriteKit view, but

353
00:17:28,346 --> 00:17:29,786
of these view controller

354
00:17:30,056 --> 00:17:32,486
You can with this new

355
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:36,986
that gives you the same, that

356
00:17:36,986 --> 00:17:38,406
to a semantic content attribute.

357
00:17:38,856 --> 00:17:43,486
And that's a brief look

358
00:17:43,716 --> 00:17:47,116
so we saw brand new directional

359
00:17:47,116 --> 00:17:49,076
with Interface Builder

360
00:17:49,356 --> 00:17:50,876
with no extra lines

361
00:17:51,126 --> 00:17:52,176
for right to left support.

362
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:55,086
You can do the same

363
00:17:55,086 --> 00:17:56,826
that are not directly

364
00:17:58,006 --> 00:17:59,826
and as a result we

365
00:17:59,826 --> 00:18:02,736
imageFlippedForRightToLeft

366
00:17:59,826 --> 00:18:02,736
imageFlippedForRightToLeft

367
00:18:03,266 --> 00:18:07,056
We also just took a look at

368
00:18:07,056 --> 00:18:10,576
on UIView for determining layout

369
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:12,576
in addition to a class method

370
00:18:12,576 --> 00:18:15,036
that lets you achieve the

371
00:18:15,686 --> 00:18:18,406
So that's iOS, and now I'd

372
00:18:18,406 --> 00:18:21,376
like to move swiftly

373
00:18:23,176 --> 00:18:27,746
So watchOS 2.1 added

374
00:18:28,036 --> 00:18:29,646
as selectable system languages.

375
00:18:30,926 --> 00:18:33,196
And what this means

376
00:18:33,196 --> 00:18:36,646
that watchKit is now

377
00:18:37,466 --> 00:18:39,686
So all watchKit elements

378
00:18:39,686 --> 00:18:41,316
when running in Arabic

379
00:18:42,296 --> 00:18:44,226
We have an API that's

380
00:18:44,406 --> 00:18:47,076
that lets you fine-tune

381
00:18:47,076 --> 00:18:48,866
or interface object instances.

382
00:18:49,456 --> 00:18:54,286
And it's important to note

383
00:18:54,286 --> 00:18:56,006
it's natural that it

384
00:18:56,006 --> 00:18:58,536
a lot of the design

385
00:18:58,536 --> 00:19:00,056
in iOS do apply on the watch.

386
00:18:58,536 --> 00:19:00,056
in iOS do apply on the watch.

387
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:03,736
So, the idea of pushing and

388
00:19:03,736 --> 00:19:06,226
in their direction, these

389
00:19:06,226 --> 00:19:08,426
and you should keep this

390
00:19:08,426 --> 00:19:10,016
that reflects this as well.

391
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:15,976
Any horizontal layout that

392
00:19:15,976 --> 00:19:20,266
or has an ordering like showing

393
00:19:20,266 --> 00:19:23,016
and then a label, you

394
00:19:23,986 --> 00:19:26,626
And, something very particular

395
00:19:26,626 --> 00:19:28,446
is the idea and concept of time

396
00:19:28,506 --> 00:19:32,266
and in particular

397
00:19:32,266 --> 00:19:35,376
And this is going back to

398
00:19:35,606 --> 00:19:38,246
if you have any radial

399
00:19:38,246 --> 00:19:40,596
and anti-clockwise UI

400
00:19:40,876 --> 00:19:43,576
across layout directions, just

401
00:19:43,576 --> 00:19:46,366
in mind in addition to the

402
00:19:46,876 --> 00:19:49,856
So how do you do

403
00:19:50,116 --> 00:19:51,496
So like I said before,

404
00:19:51,496 --> 00:19:53,786
all interface objects now do

405
00:19:53,786 --> 00:19:55,306
in right to left,

406
00:19:55,306 --> 00:19:56,626
your sliders and your switches.

407
00:19:58,296 --> 00:20:00,966
In addition to that,

408
00:19:58,296 --> 00:20:00,966
In addition to that,

409
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:03,476
and alignment also

410
00:20:03,476 --> 00:20:06,686
So this means that the direction

411
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:11,236
and their alignment and also

412
00:20:11,236 --> 00:20:13,566
in watchKit relative to

413
00:20:13,566 --> 00:20:16,936
So in the example, above

414
00:20:17,176 --> 00:20:18,836
with a horizontal

415
00:20:18,836 --> 00:20:20,286
with left alignment

416
00:20:21,226 --> 00:20:23,436
And a vertical group at the

417
00:20:24,206 --> 00:20:27,976
When I run this app in Hebrew,

418
00:20:28,186 --> 00:20:29,896
so note the ordering

419
00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:31,746
at the horizontal

420
00:20:32,296 --> 00:20:35,906
We have semantic content

421
00:20:35,906 --> 00:20:37,946
with the same cases

422
00:20:37,946 --> 00:20:40,876
about to help manage

423
00:20:40,876 --> 00:20:43,296
interface objects or groups.

424
00:20:43,936 --> 00:20:46,606
And seeing this in action

425
00:20:46,606 --> 00:20:49,296
as any other property that you

426
00:20:51,506 --> 00:20:54,066
If you're not using

427
00:20:54,066 --> 00:20:55,846
say you're using

428
00:20:55,846 --> 00:20:57,026
they're new in watchOS 3,

429
00:20:57,626 --> 00:21:00,376
you could still evaluate

430
00:20:57,626 --> 00:21:00,376
you could still evaluate

431
00:21:00,636 --> 00:21:02,616
if you have a semantic

432
00:21:02,616 --> 00:21:06,196
So here I just got the

433
00:21:06,246 --> 00:21:08,906
on interface device and once

434
00:21:08,906 --> 00:21:10,786
if it's left to right

435
00:21:11,366 --> 00:21:15,876
And that's a brief look at

436
00:21:16,406 --> 00:21:19,436
So once again it's the same

437
00:21:20,936 --> 00:21:23,376
All watchKit elements do the

438
00:21:23,626 --> 00:21:27,026
with no extra work needed

439
00:21:27,026 --> 00:21:28,506
that you have should

440
00:21:29,206 --> 00:21:32,116
Keeping in mind of course,

441
00:21:32,116 --> 00:21:34,716
that I mentioned and you can

442
00:21:35,026 --> 00:21:37,986
to help determine the

443
00:21:38,466 --> 00:21:41,806
And with that, I'd like to

444
00:21:42,036 --> 00:21:44,766
to talk to you about macOS and

445
00:21:45,116 --> 00:21:47,976
thank you very much, I hope you

446
00:21:48,146 --> 00:21:50,146
[ Applause ]

447
00:21:50,276 --> 00:21:50,726
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

448
00:21:51,716 --> 00:21:53,746
So let's talk about macOS.

449
00:21:54,026 --> 00:21:57,056
Just like the other

450
00:21:57,306 --> 00:21:59,666
the concepts are exactly

451
00:22:00,016 --> 00:22:02,436
So if you are using

452
00:22:03,176 --> 00:22:05,156
you will get the

453
00:22:05,156 --> 00:22:07,296
when you're running your app

454
00:22:07,806 --> 00:22:10,116
So now I would like to walk

455
00:22:10,116 --> 00:22:13,356
from our own system to show

456
00:22:14,346 --> 00:22:17,506
So let's start with what we

457
00:22:18,036 --> 00:22:19,996
So we call these

458
00:22:20,136 --> 00:22:23,576
because the layout follow the

459
00:22:23,576 --> 00:22:25,856
in instead of your

460
00:22:26,246 --> 00:22:28,756
But this will make more sense

461
00:22:28,996 --> 00:22:31,456
so let's take a look,

462
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:35,066
So I'm running my system in

463
00:22:35,526 --> 00:22:39,076
and as you can see here,

464
00:22:39,076 --> 00:22:40,676
from the right edge

465
00:22:41,586 --> 00:22:45,666
Also, the elements inside the

466
00:22:46,726 --> 00:22:51,146
And this concept also

467
00:22:51,686 --> 00:22:55,336
So by design we decided to

468
00:22:55,336 --> 00:22:58,026
consistent across

469
00:22:58,026 --> 00:22:59,626
if your app is localized or not.

470
00:23:00,286 --> 00:23:02,056
So if you are doing

471
00:23:02,226 --> 00:23:05,006
and you're doing your own custom

472
00:23:05,006 --> 00:23:07,566
that into consideration

473
00:23:07,566 --> 00:23:09,946
if you don't support Arabic

474
00:23:11,506 --> 00:23:13,506
Next, app level controls.

475
00:23:13,556 --> 00:23:18,236
So app level controls here,

476
00:23:18,236 --> 00:23:20,346
your layout direction

477
00:23:20,346 --> 00:23:24,726
So for example, NSTableView,

478
00:23:24,726 --> 00:23:28,216
from the activity monitor app,

479
00:23:28,286 --> 00:23:30,806
and as you can see the table

480
00:23:30,806 --> 00:23:33,736
automatically when I'm running

481
00:23:34,506 --> 00:23:37,056
Another example,

482
00:23:38,006 --> 00:23:39,236
and from the finder app

483
00:23:39,426 --> 00:23:42,156
where the collection view flow

484
00:23:42,766 --> 00:23:44,156
I will give you one

485
00:23:45,446 --> 00:23:48,776
NSScrollView and the

486
00:23:49,116 --> 00:23:50,636
so we also switch the position

487
00:23:50,636 --> 00:23:52,836
of the scroll bar

488
00:23:53,256 --> 00:23:54,896
And this also will

489
00:23:54,896 --> 00:23:56,716
with the content of

490
00:23:57,456 --> 00:24:02,426
And keep in mind if you are

491
00:23:57,456 --> 00:24:02,426
And keep in mind if you are

492
00:24:02,836 --> 00:24:05,366
so scroll in there works

493
00:24:05,736 --> 00:24:08,876
So WebKit will look at the

494
00:24:09,056 --> 00:24:12,406
and evaluate its HTML

495
00:24:12,406 --> 00:24:14,666
on that value it will

496
00:24:15,386 --> 00:24:18,836
So for example here, I'm running

497
00:24:18,836 --> 00:24:20,136
in Apple.com in English.

498
00:24:20,906 --> 00:24:24,656
So looking at the content of

499
00:24:25,146 --> 00:24:27,336
the dir attribute here

500
00:24:27,396 --> 00:24:30,146
so we position the scroll

501
00:24:31,646 --> 00:24:33,906
If I take the exact

502
00:24:34,386 --> 00:24:36,646
but this time I am in

503
00:24:36,716 --> 00:24:38,056
so looking at the content.

504
00:24:38,636 --> 00:24:40,266
So here my content is in Arabic,

505
00:24:40,366 --> 00:24:43,226
looking at the dir attributes

506
00:24:43,226 --> 00:24:45,496
to left, so we switch the

507
00:24:45,786 --> 00:24:48,726
So these are just examples

508
00:24:48,946 --> 00:24:51,156
and AppKit controls,

509
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:52,796
like to talk to you about API.

510
00:24:55,746 --> 00:24:57,886
So we just saw in

511
00:24:57,886 --> 00:25:00,086
that WebKit's controls work

512
00:24:57,886 --> 00:25:00,086
that WebKit's controls work

513
00:25:00,086 --> 00:25:01,096
from AppKit.

514
00:25:01,736 --> 00:25:04,086
So with that we are

515
00:25:04,686 --> 00:25:08,106
in WebKit called

516
00:25:08,586 --> 00:25:12,416
As I mentioned, the default

517
00:25:12,606 --> 00:25:16,896
of your webpage, but you can

518
00:25:16,896 --> 00:25:18,336
for example your scrollers

519
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:20,346
to follow the system

520
00:25:20,416 --> 00:25:22,106
of the content of your webpage.

521
00:25:22,376 --> 00:25:25,066
So you can override it to use

522
00:25:26,846 --> 00:25:28,926
Next, let's talk

523
00:25:29,636 --> 00:25:35,486
As a quick recap, if you use

524
00:25:35,486 --> 00:25:36,656
don't have to do anything,

525
00:25:36,796 --> 00:25:38,516
everything will just

526
00:25:39,276 --> 00:25:43,376
Now you might have a specific

527
00:25:43,376 --> 00:25:45,126
to layout your views

528
00:25:45,816 --> 00:25:47,516
So in that case we

529
00:25:47,516 --> 00:25:49,296
that you use StackViews

530
00:25:49,426 --> 00:25:50,876
So grid views are new to macOS,

531
00:25:50,876 --> 00:25:54,546
and both these tools are really

532
00:25:54,546 --> 00:25:56,966
up auto layouts constraints

533
00:25:57,566 --> 00:26:00,166
And they also use leading

534
00:25:57,566 --> 00:26:00,166
And they also use leading

535
00:26:00,166 --> 00:26:02,016
which will flip your

536
00:26:02,016 --> 00:26:03,806
when you're running in a

537
00:26:03,896 --> 00:26:08,966
If you are not using StackViews

538
00:26:09,486 --> 00:26:11,656
If you're not familiar with

539
00:26:11,656 --> 00:26:15,326
from previous years and there is

540
00:26:15,326 --> 00:26:16,736
What's New in Auto

541
00:26:17,686 --> 00:26:21,196
Finally, if you're

542
00:26:21,196 --> 00:26:22,996
in base approach

543
00:26:22,996 --> 00:26:24,816
of flipping the text

544
00:26:25,376 --> 00:26:30,326
In addition to that, we

545
00:26:30,536 --> 00:26:33,106
that will let you get and

546
00:26:33,106 --> 00:26:33,826
of your views.

547
00:26:34,486 --> 00:26:37,106
So for example here,

548
00:26:37,106 --> 00:26:39,056
that has two values,

549
00:26:39,606 --> 00:26:41,806
So I want my slider

550
00:26:41,806 --> 00:26:43,456
across all my localizations,

551
00:26:43,556 --> 00:26:45,366
because it makes sense

552
00:26:45,366 --> 00:26:47,806
on the left side and

553
00:26:47,806 --> 00:26:48,546
on the right side.

554
00:26:48,546 --> 00:26:51,726
So here it will make total sense

555
00:26:51,726 --> 00:26:53,606
of my slider to be

556
00:26:54,756 --> 00:26:57,656
So as I mentioned, we

557
00:26:57,936 --> 00:26:59,086
that will let you do that.

558
00:26:59,626 --> 00:27:01,256
The default value is set

559
00:26:59,626 --> 00:27:01,256
The default value is set

560
00:27:01,256 --> 00:27:03,746
to NSApp.userInterfaceLayout

561
00:27:04,716 --> 00:27:07,956
but you can override it

562
00:27:07,956 --> 00:27:09,566
on what you want to

563
00:27:11,186 --> 00:27:13,546
Now let's talk about images.

564
00:27:14,276 --> 00:27:17,996
As we just saw in

565
00:27:18,176 --> 00:27:22,206
we introduced directional

566
00:27:22,206 --> 00:27:24,996
So assets catalogs

567
00:27:24,996 --> 00:27:28,296
and they work exactly the same

568
00:27:28,296 --> 00:27:29,536
to go through details here.

569
00:27:30,216 --> 00:27:33,006
But again, sometimes you

570
00:27:33,006 --> 00:27:36,246
in your application bundle

571
00:27:36,246 --> 00:27:38,776
from a remote location,

572
00:27:39,666 --> 00:27:43,546
So we also have an API in

573
00:27:43,546 --> 00:27:45,486
that and register

574
00:27:46,076 --> 00:27:47,906
So let's go through an

575
00:27:48,056 --> 00:27:49,626
just see how it works.

576
00:27:51,326 --> 00:27:56,086
So as I mentioned, sometimes you

577
00:27:56,286 --> 00:27:57,686
and you want to register them.

578
00:27:57,686 --> 00:28:00,086
So first what you need to

579
00:27:57,686 --> 00:28:00,086
So first what you need to

580
00:28:00,086 --> 00:28:02,116
to right image by

581
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:04,446
And once you have that you need

582
00:28:04,446 --> 00:28:06,536
to set this layout

583
00:28:07,026 --> 00:28:09,246
So same thing for your

584
00:28:09,576 --> 00:28:12,506
but this time you will

585
00:28:13,206 --> 00:28:17,876
So once you have both images, so

586
00:28:17,876 --> 00:28:22,136
to left image representation

587
00:28:22,136 --> 00:28:24,196
and that by using

588
00:28:24,946 --> 00:28:28,516
So with that, once you have both

589
00:28:28,516 --> 00:28:30,836
the right image for

590
00:28:31,316 --> 00:28:33,116
either if you're running

591
00:28:33,116 --> 00:28:35,456
to right localization or a

592
00:28:37,676 --> 00:28:41,556
Finally, we have new

593
00:28:42,006 --> 00:28:43,446
for common AppKit controls.

594
00:28:44,156 --> 00:28:49,406
For an accessory for example, it

595
00:28:49,406 --> 00:28:51,716
and auto layout attributes

596
00:28:52,426 --> 00:28:55,886
And for NSButton, it

597
00:28:56,126 --> 00:28:59,606
the checkbox position, and the

598
00:28:59,606 --> 00:29:00,116
for free.

599
00:28:59,606 --> 00:29:00,116
for free.

600
00:29:00,666 --> 00:29:02,566
So with that, I would

601
00:29:02,566 --> 00:29:10,976
to summarize what we

602
00:29:15,876 --> 00:29:19,086
Alright. Cool, so I got

603
00:29:19,086 --> 00:29:23,226
and I created a scoreboard

604
00:29:23,226 --> 00:29:24,636
when we are playing

605
00:29:24,816 --> 00:29:29,356
So here I have a simple,

606
00:29:29,356 --> 00:29:31,876
in my view controller, I

607
00:29:32,366 --> 00:29:34,826
and I already setup my

608
00:29:35,326 --> 00:29:39,616
And inside my table view cell

609
00:29:40,036 --> 00:29:41,376
and a [inaudible]

610
00:29:41,816 --> 00:29:43,976
So here I'm using

611
00:29:43,976 --> 00:29:47,526
out the elements inside my table

612
00:29:47,526 --> 00:29:49,696
to worry about setting

613
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:52,146
because text view just

614
00:29:52,926 --> 00:29:55,676
And here at the bottom,

615
00:29:55,676 --> 00:29:58,366
where I update my highest

616
00:29:58,606 --> 00:29:59,336
So pretty simple.

617
00:30:00,186 --> 00:30:02,876
So what I'm going to do now,

618
00:30:02,876 --> 00:30:04,986
to left environment

619
00:30:05,066 --> 00:30:06,806
and see how it looks like.

620
00:30:07,776 --> 00:30:10,446
Great. So I'm going to

621
00:30:11,136 --> 00:30:14,556
to my application language

622
00:30:14,556 --> 00:30:16,846
to left pseudo language

623
00:30:17,656 --> 00:30:21,846
I'm going to build

624
00:30:21,846 --> 00:30:23,126
And it's building, great.

625
00:30:23,476 --> 00:30:26,096
So as you can see here without

626
00:30:26,096 --> 00:30:28,096
just by using storyboard,

627
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:29,576
auto layouts, it just works.

628
00:30:30,106 --> 00:30:34,526
So that's it, so now that my app

629
00:30:34,576 --> 00:30:40,306
what I'm going to do, I want

630
00:30:40,746 --> 00:30:43,906
I'm going to run

631
00:30:45,266 --> 00:30:49,446
in my system language instead

632
00:30:49,616 --> 00:30:51,436
So this will just run

633
00:30:51,436 --> 00:30:52,866
because my system

634
00:30:53,556 --> 00:30:57,886
Now I'm going to

635
00:30:58,086 --> 00:31:01,006
So why I'm doing this, so I just

636
00:30:58,086 --> 00:31:01,006
So why I'm doing this, so I just

637
00:31:01,006 --> 00:31:02,616
of international

638
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:06,266
So here, so my app looks

639
00:31:06,616 --> 00:31:07,936
and now I want to join the game.

640
00:31:08,016 --> 00:31:09,416
So I'm going to add

641
00:31:09,996 --> 00:31:15,216
I'm going to click here, add

642
00:31:15,216 --> 00:31:18,126
for fun, I want to write my

643
00:31:18,346 --> 00:31:20,156
So I'm going to go ahead

644
00:31:21,206 --> 00:31:22,816
to use Arabic instead

645
00:31:23,656 --> 00:31:27,626
Alright, so I type my

646
00:31:28,926 --> 00:31:31,446
And I'm also really good at

647
00:31:31,446 --> 00:31:33,416
to win this game, so I'm

648
00:31:33,416 --> 00:31:34,846
So I'm just going to

649
00:31:35,566 --> 00:31:39,546
So, alright, see

650
00:31:39,636 --> 00:31:44,566
So just by updating my name, so

651
00:31:44,566 --> 00:31:46,976
because it jumps

652
00:31:46,976 --> 00:31:48,746
and now my label just reads "!

653
00:31:48,746 --> 00:31:51,676
has the highest score 12, Sara."

654
00:31:51,676 --> 00:31:53,156
That doesn't make any sense.

655
00:31:54,056 --> 00:31:57,596
So in the next section I

656
00:31:57,596 --> 00:32:00,246
to solve this kind of

657
00:31:57,596 --> 00:32:00,246
to solve this kind of

658
00:32:00,956 --> 00:32:02,526
by directional text correctly.

659
00:32:03,026 --> 00:32:04,846
So let's go back to slides.

660
00:32:14,196 --> 00:32:16,996
So we just saw in the demo

661
00:32:16,996 --> 00:32:19,836
in Arabic, it broke the

662
00:32:20,436 --> 00:32:22,846
So now let's see how we can

663
00:32:26,936 --> 00:32:30,516
So rendering text in

664
00:32:30,516 --> 00:32:31,556
really important.

665
00:32:32,506 --> 00:32:35,206
It doesn't matter if

666
00:32:35,356 --> 00:32:36,796
of that specific language,

667
00:32:36,866 --> 00:32:39,446
even if you are supporting

668
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:43,506
your users can still

669
00:32:43,546 --> 00:32:45,086
in any other language.

670
00:32:45,746 --> 00:32:49,726
And when it comes to text, it's

671
00:32:50,106 --> 00:32:53,276
that text alignment and

672
00:32:53,276 --> 00:32:54,266
different concepts.

673
00:32:54,906 --> 00:32:57,996
So for example here, I have

674
00:32:58,206 --> 00:33:00,816
it's right aligned, it's

675
00:32:58,206 --> 00:33:00,816
it's right aligned, it's

676
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:03,406
because you might need

677
00:33:03,406 --> 00:33:04,986
so it won't break

678
00:33:05,906 --> 00:33:10,256
But if I take the same example

679
00:33:10,596 --> 00:33:12,956
but I'm forcing the writing

680
00:33:12,956 --> 00:33:15,066
to left, that will break

681
00:33:15,366 --> 00:33:17,636
As you can see here the

682
00:33:17,636 --> 00:33:18,736
in the correct position.

683
00:33:19,396 --> 00:33:21,956
So let's talk a little

684
00:33:22,456 --> 00:33:25,716
Lateral alignment is

685
00:33:25,836 --> 00:33:27,626
so if you don't override

686
00:33:28,136 --> 00:33:30,996
so we'll get the right

687
00:33:31,496 --> 00:33:33,146
So let's talk about

688
00:33:33,146 --> 00:33:34,626
because it's a little

689
00:33:35,306 --> 00:33:40,666
So here I'm just going to give

690
00:33:40,746 --> 00:33:43,436
of the text engine by algorithm.

691
00:33:43,716 --> 00:33:46,056
But if you want to

692
00:33:46,056 --> 00:33:47,686
by the algorithm please check

693
00:33:47,686 --> 00:33:50,066
out the full specification

694
00:33:50,776 --> 00:33:52,206
But let's start with the basics.

695
00:33:52,856 --> 00:33:56,306
So there are three types

696
00:33:56,906 --> 00:33:59,836
So they can be either

697
00:34:00,016 --> 00:34:02,776
for example scripts

698
00:34:02,776 --> 00:34:05,256
with Latin, Chinese or Japanese.

699
00:34:06,466 --> 00:34:10,346
They can be strong right to left

700
00:34:10,346 --> 00:34:15,376
like Arabic, Hebrew, Farsi or

701
00:34:15,576 --> 00:34:17,696
that they don't have a

702
00:34:18,126 --> 00:34:20,996
and we call these neutral

703
00:34:21,216 --> 00:34:22,585
For example spaces.

704
00:34:23,255 --> 00:34:28,846
So how the text engine decides

705
00:34:28,846 --> 00:34:30,505
of a specific paragraph?

706
00:34:31,076 --> 00:34:34,005
So the text engine just look

707
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:37,255
at the first strong Unicode

708
00:34:37,636 --> 00:34:39,106
And if it's a strong

709
00:34:39,106 --> 00:34:41,106
my paragraph would

710
00:34:41,106 --> 00:34:43,315
If it's strong left to right,

711
00:34:43,315 --> 00:34:44,235
to right directionality.

712
00:34:44,996 --> 00:34:48,005
So let's walk through an example

713
00:34:48,835 --> 00:34:51,076
So if I take my label

714
00:34:51,366 --> 00:34:53,315
%@ has the highest color.

715
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:59,406
So I have no idea at runtime

716
00:34:59,406 --> 00:35:01,016
because my user can write

717
00:34:59,406 --> 00:35:01,016
because my user can write

718
00:35:01,126 --> 00:35:03,206
or input anything,

719
00:35:03,836 --> 00:35:05,716
So let's take the

720
00:35:06,076 --> 00:35:09,696
where my %@ will be

721
00:35:10,666 --> 00:35:14,716
So here the first character

722
00:35:15,036 --> 00:35:16,376
so it's a strong left to right.

723
00:35:16,716 --> 00:35:19,876
So the directionality of my

724
00:35:19,876 --> 00:35:21,016
so it renders correctly.

725
00:35:22,066 --> 00:35:26,576
Now if my variable is

726
00:35:26,996 --> 00:35:30,956
So the first strong character

727
00:35:30,956 --> 00:35:32,686
which give the directionality

728
00:35:32,686 --> 00:35:34,996
of my whole paragraph

729
00:35:35,146 --> 00:35:38,766
So that's why the, my

730
00:35:38,836 --> 00:35:39,626
so this is wrong.

731
00:35:40,336 --> 00:35:44,676
So the right behavior here will

732
00:35:44,676 --> 00:35:47,196
to see something like that,

733
00:35:47,306 --> 00:35:49,716
I want it to be on the

734
00:35:49,716 --> 00:35:52,636
of my paragraph will be rendered

735
00:35:54,036 --> 00:35:56,606
So wouldn't it be great

736
00:35:56,796 --> 00:35:59,366
that will take my

737
00:35:59,786 --> 00:36:02,156
and give it its own

738
00:35:59,786 --> 00:36:02,156
and give it its own

739
00:36:02,196 --> 00:36:04,116
without affecting the

740
00:36:04,686 --> 00:36:07,526
And that's possible

741
00:36:07,996 --> 00:36:11,816
So Isolates are the latest

742
00:36:11,816 --> 00:36:14,036
that were introduced

743
00:36:14,456 --> 00:36:17,576
and that our text engine

744
00:36:18,216 --> 00:36:22,806
So as I mentioned, Isolates will

745
00:36:23,246 --> 00:36:26,466
and have the directionality

746
00:36:26,926 --> 00:36:30,236
and that's without affecting

747
00:36:30,236 --> 00:36:33,016
And I'm happy to

748
00:36:33,016 --> 00:36:37,016
to insert these characters

749
00:36:37,766 --> 00:36:40,446
because if you use

750
00:36:41,216 --> 00:36:43,006
we do that for you

751
00:36:43,156 --> 00:36:47,026
So localizedStringWithFormat

752
00:36:47,026 --> 00:36:49,106
and it will do the

753
00:36:50,526 --> 00:36:53,526
So now, I would like to

754
00:36:53,526 --> 00:36:56,026
and fix the issue we introduce

755
00:36:56,026 --> 00:36:57,106
of code, so let's do that.

756
00:37:04,796 --> 00:37:06,406
Alright, so cool.

757
00:37:06,526 --> 00:37:09,696
So now I'm going to go back

758
00:37:10,446 --> 00:37:12,166
and this is where

759
00:37:12,706 --> 00:37:16,896
So just to save some time

760
00:37:16,896 --> 00:37:18,136
to use localized standard string

761
00:37:18,136 --> 00:37:20,196
with format instead

762
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:24,116
So I'm going to go ahead here

763
00:37:24,556 --> 00:37:27,596
and uncomment the line that is

764
00:37:28,476 --> 00:37:32,756
I'm going to run my app again,

765
00:37:38,416 --> 00:37:42,416
Right, so as you can see

766
00:37:42,416 --> 00:37:45,336
So my name now is on the

767
00:37:45,436 --> 00:37:46,686
I can read it correctly.

768
00:37:47,026 --> 00:37:49,866
So let's see if it works

769
00:37:50,576 --> 00:37:54,176
So see here if I update

770
00:37:54,876 --> 00:37:56,386
And with Arabic names as well,

771
00:37:56,656 --> 00:37:59,186
and that's Isolates

772
00:37:59,856 --> 00:38:00,946
So let's go back to slides.

773
00:37:59,856 --> 00:38:00,946
So let's go back to slides.

774
00:38:01,516 --> 00:38:06,056
[ Applause ]

775
00:38:06,556 --> 00:38:08,036
Alright so let's summarize.

776
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:13,566
So in this session we introduced

777
00:38:14,156 --> 00:38:17,646
So it's easier now for you

778
00:38:17,646 --> 00:38:20,806
for both your left to right and

779
00:38:22,146 --> 00:38:26,416
We have new APIs for you

780
00:38:27,646 --> 00:38:31,346
And auto layout is your best

781
00:38:31,346 --> 00:38:33,856
out your views and support

782
00:38:35,506 --> 00:38:38,366
And we also improved

783
00:38:38,486 --> 00:38:40,716
by supporting Isolates

784
00:38:42,226 --> 00:38:46,026
So with all these improvements,

785
00:38:46,026 --> 00:38:49,456
as a developer, to go ahead

786
00:38:51,146 --> 00:38:54,496
