[ Music ]

2
00:00:24,156 --> 00:00:24,946
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

3
00:00:25,126 --> 00:00:27,126
[ Applause ]

4
00:00:27,236 --> 00:00:28,686
&gt;&gt; Welcome to Session 303.

5
00:00:29,126 --> 00:00:30,116
I'm Todd Fernandez.

6
00:00:30,206 --> 00:00:32,146
And I'm very pleased to be

7
00:00:32,146 --> 00:00:35,316
to give you an update on what's

8
00:00:36,276 --> 00:00:38,566
Now, before we begin,

9
00:00:38,566 --> 00:00:40,286
that I am still a

10
00:00:40,286 --> 00:00:42,406
after attending my college

11
00:00:43,056 --> 00:00:44,676
And I'm not going to

12
00:00:44,676 --> 00:00:46,386
but if it had been

13
00:00:46,386 --> 00:00:47,636
I would have received

14
00:00:49,006 --> 00:00:51,616
Now, despite being a little

15
00:00:51,616 --> 00:00:54,336
to see you all here in the hall,

16
00:00:54,336 --> 00:00:56,696
out to all of you watching the

17
00:00:57,286 --> 00:01:00,046
as well as you future viewers

18
00:00:57,286 --> 00:01:00,046
as well as you future viewers

19
00:01:00,046 --> 00:01:03,306
at some indefinite period

20
00:01:03,866 --> 00:01:04,956
Hello, future viewers.

21
00:01:07,826 --> 00:01:10,236
But speaking of the

22
00:01:11,586 --> 00:01:12,926
no, not that kind of time,

23
00:01:12,926 --> 00:01:14,366
although I do love

24
00:01:14,986 --> 00:01:16,256
I want to talk about

25
00:01:17,566 --> 00:01:21,406
Now, many of you here in the

26
00:01:21,406 --> 00:01:23,446
like a quiet time for

27
00:01:23,616 --> 00:01:27,216
As we toil behind the scenes

28
00:01:27,266 --> 00:01:31,326
that we're going to

29
00:01:31,416 --> 00:01:33,406
and then ship in

30
00:01:34,416 --> 00:01:36,696
But it turns out

31
00:01:37,136 --> 00:01:38,276
that schools actually want

32
00:01:38,276 --> 00:01:40,986
to use those features

33
00:01:40,986 --> 00:01:41,816
fall releases.

34
00:01:42,606 --> 00:01:44,626
They want to configure

35
00:01:44,626 --> 00:01:46,886
of all those new

36
00:01:47,436 --> 00:01:48,916
for use during the

37
00:01:49,596 --> 00:01:51,036
But in order to do that,

38
00:01:51,646 --> 00:01:53,836
they need to have already

39
00:01:53,836 --> 00:01:55,436
and software even earlier.

40
00:01:56,466 --> 00:01:59,436
And in order to do that, they

41
00:01:59,436 --> 00:02:02,786
of the new hardware, software,

42
00:01:59,436 --> 00:02:02,786
of the new hardware, software,

43
00:02:03,556 --> 00:02:05,856
Which brings us to iOS 9.3.

44
00:02:06,456 --> 00:02:08,466
It's really strange how

45
00:02:08,466 --> 00:02:10,526
of jumped right out at us.

46
00:02:11,186 --> 00:02:12,996
But the schedule isn't

47
00:02:12,996 --> 00:02:14,176
what about the features?

48
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:17,226
There are a ton of new

49
00:02:17,406 --> 00:02:19,866
in our spring software

50
00:02:20,326 --> 00:02:22,726
But the true stars of the

51
00:02:22,726 --> 00:02:25,476
Manager, Shared iPad,

52
00:02:26,416 --> 00:02:29,076
Let's first talk a little bit

53
00:02:29,776 --> 00:02:32,126
which provides a

54
00:02:32,126 --> 00:02:34,516
to access Apple's device

55
00:02:35,606 --> 00:02:38,796
Those services include

56
00:02:38,796 --> 00:02:40,986
and teachers, as well as

57
00:02:40,986 --> 00:02:44,796
between them, configuring how

58
00:02:44,796 --> 00:02:48,296
for remote management, and

59
00:02:48,336 --> 00:02:50,856
and creating the curriculum

60
00:02:52,356 --> 00:02:55,636
And fortunately, one of the

61
00:02:55,636 --> 00:02:56,396
of the school districts

62
00:02:56,396 --> 00:02:59,496
which piloted these features

63
00:02:59,496 --> 00:03:02,206
that Apple School Manager will

64
00:02:59,496 --> 00:03:02,206
that Apple School Manager will

65
00:03:02,206 --> 00:03:05,366
of time, allowing them to

66
00:03:05,366 --> 00:03:07,286
and our student accounts

67
00:03:07,636 --> 00:03:08,866
exactly what we intended.

68
00:03:10,006 --> 00:03:11,556
Now let's turn to Shared iPad.

69
00:03:12,656 --> 00:03:16,386
Shared iPad allows the majority

70
00:03:16,386 --> 00:03:18,736
and around the world

71
00:03:19,066 --> 00:03:22,286
to provide their students

72
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:25,396
and enable them to use the

73
00:03:26,806 --> 00:03:30,216
Shared iPad can be configured so

74
00:03:30,216 --> 00:03:32,176
in by simply tapping

75
00:03:32,896 --> 00:03:34,806
and entering a four-digit

76
00:03:36,036 --> 00:03:38,996
Student data is stored in

77
00:03:38,996 --> 00:03:42,466
to a specific iPad when

78
00:03:43,836 --> 00:03:47,676
Again, it's great to see that

79
00:03:47,676 --> 00:03:51,016
for getting these Shared iPads

80
00:03:51,016 --> 00:03:54,326
that Shared iPad will allow our

81
00:03:54,326 --> 00:03:55,156
of shared devices

82
00:03:55,156 --> 00:03:57,846
into a personalized learning

83
00:03:58,226 --> 00:03:59,316
Again, nailed it.

84
00:04:00,356 --> 00:04:00,856
All right.

85
00:04:01,086 --> 00:04:02,456
Finally, Classroom.

86
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:06,286
Classroom empowers

87
00:04:06,286 --> 00:04:08,456
and their students

88
00:04:08,776 --> 00:04:12,256
rather than managing technology

89
00:04:12,606 --> 00:04:15,366
of key capabilities at

90
00:04:15,366 --> 00:04:16,166
in the classroom.

91
00:04:17,516 --> 00:04:22,076
Teachers can easily open an app

92
00:04:22,076 --> 00:04:26,076
or a selected group of student

93
00:04:26,076 --> 00:04:31,256
to the Classroom Apple TV, or

94
00:04:31,256 --> 00:04:33,406
who may be off task even

95
00:04:33,406 --> 00:04:35,766
with a different group of

96
00:04:35,946 --> 00:04:39,006
And I was very fortunate

97
00:04:39,006 --> 00:04:41,426
to visit Mr. Garcia's

98
00:04:41,556 --> 00:04:43,956
and it was truly inspiring

99
00:04:43,956 --> 00:04:46,326
that his students were

100
00:04:46,596 --> 00:04:48,306
with his support

101
00:04:48,926 --> 00:04:51,476
And after his experience

102
00:04:51,476 --> 00:04:53,776
that Classroom has been an

103
00:04:53,776 --> 00:04:56,646
the school day to enhance the

104
00:04:56,646 --> 00:04:57,886
going on his classroom.

105
00:04:58,476 --> 00:05:00,646
Classroom helps him to keep

106
00:04:58,476 --> 00:05:00,646
Classroom helps him to keep

107
00:05:00,646 --> 00:05:03,616
for their work while also

108
00:05:03,616 --> 00:05:04,566
in their assignments.

109
00:05:05,626 --> 00:05:07,836
Now while it's extremely

110
00:05:07,836 --> 00:05:11,146
of response to the features we

111
00:05:11,146 --> 00:05:13,916
to hear some great feedback

112
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:17,336
including from some very

113
00:05:17,806 --> 00:05:21,336
who have raved about the blazing

114
00:05:21,336 --> 00:05:22,536
of Classroom's features.

115
00:05:22,846 --> 00:05:26,836
Now, these spring 2016 changes

116
00:05:27,006 --> 00:05:29,056
with an extremely

117
00:05:29,056 --> 00:05:31,556
and high quality

118
00:05:31,556 --> 00:05:34,596
which schools need

119
00:05:34,896 --> 00:05:37,116
to deliver not only

120
00:05:37,266 --> 00:05:39,026
and most advanced

121
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:41,736
but also the best device

122
00:05:43,056 --> 00:05:46,056
We've demonstrated this

123
00:05:46,186 --> 00:05:47,566
in providing a great experience

124
00:05:47,566 --> 00:05:50,156
to schools bringing Apple

125
00:05:50,826 --> 00:05:53,536
But we need all of our

126
00:05:53,536 --> 00:05:56,616
to tool providers, to all of you

127
00:05:56,616 --> 00:05:59,016
to see your app used by

128
00:05:59,016 --> 00:06:02,216
around the world to

129
00:05:59,016 --> 00:06:02,216
around the world to

130
00:06:02,216 --> 00:06:04,056
that that great experience

131
00:06:04,056 --> 00:06:06,436
of our joint customers

132
00:06:07,616 --> 00:06:09,816
But I do want to

133
00:06:09,816 --> 00:06:12,456
up because although we don't

134
00:06:12,656 --> 00:06:13,906
we are definitely not done yet.

135
00:06:14,116 --> 00:06:18,966
So today I'm going to cover

136
00:06:18,966 --> 00:06:21,046
across the entire device

137
00:06:21,436 --> 00:06:22,686
So let's go ahead

138
00:06:22,686 --> 00:06:28,146
I'll cover a few changes to

139
00:06:28,146 --> 00:06:30,096
into some detail

140
00:06:30,096 --> 00:06:32,236
like Apple School Manager,

141
00:06:32,496 --> 00:06:33,666
of course, Shared iPad.

142
00:06:36,376 --> 00:06:39,356
So first I want to cover a few

143
00:06:39,516 --> 00:06:42,346
For Enterprise customers we

144
00:06:42,346 --> 00:06:44,326
programs, the Device

145
00:06:44,326 --> 00:06:47,366
for configuring how your devices

146
00:06:47,906 --> 00:06:50,856
as well as the volume purchase

147
00:06:50,856 --> 00:06:53,706
and books and distributing them

148
00:06:54,966 --> 00:06:56,546
However, we've also

149
00:06:56,546 --> 00:06:59,056
of new device management

150
00:06:59,176 --> 00:07:01,476
in the spring and

151
00:06:59,176 --> 00:07:01,476
in the spring and

152
00:07:01,476 --> 00:07:02,606
about later in this session.

153
00:07:02,606 --> 00:07:05,736
And we'll try to highlight those

154
00:07:05,736 --> 00:07:08,516
to Enterprise customers, though

155
00:07:08,516 --> 00:07:11,226
for education also are

156
00:07:12,646 --> 00:07:15,026
Turning to education,

157
00:07:15,026 --> 00:07:16,986
about Apple School

158
00:07:17,796 --> 00:07:21,056
As I mentioned, it allows the

159
00:07:21,276 --> 00:07:25,426
the devices, and the content the

160
00:07:25,426 --> 00:07:27,566
that improved performance

161
00:07:29,936 --> 00:07:32,196
With respect to getting

162
00:07:32,196 --> 00:07:35,666
there are two options: You can

163
00:07:35,716 --> 00:07:38,676
to your student information

164
00:07:38,676 --> 00:07:41,136
out all the student,

165
00:07:41,136 --> 00:07:44,686
and relationship information;

166
00:07:44,686 --> 00:07:47,246
that information

167
00:07:47,646 --> 00:07:51,006
Once Apple School Manager

168
00:07:51,696 --> 00:07:54,926
it creates managed Apple IDs

169
00:07:55,566 --> 00:07:59,786
as well as creating classes

170
00:07:59,786 --> 00:08:02,516
between which teachers have

171
00:07:59,786 --> 00:08:02,516
between which teachers have

172
00:08:05,826 --> 00:08:07,626
What are those managed

173
00:08:07,986 --> 00:08:10,246
Well, they're used both

174
00:08:10,596 --> 00:08:12,026
as administer accounts

175
00:08:12,286 --> 00:08:14,646
and accommodate tiered

176
00:08:14,646 --> 00:08:17,486
so that different administers

177
00:08:17,486 --> 00:08:20,176
for managing your school's

178
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:24,676
The student accounts have a

179
00:08:25,566 --> 00:08:28,206
They're required to

180
00:08:28,856 --> 00:08:31,456
but they can be used for

181
00:08:32,306 --> 00:08:35,346
And in Apple School Manager

182
00:08:35,346 --> 00:08:37,006
options for Managed Apple ID

183
00:08:37,306 --> 00:08:40,905
from the full-strength iCloud

184
00:08:40,905 --> 00:08:43,586
or six-digit pass code.

185
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:45,786
Managed Apple IDs are

186
00:08:45,886 --> 00:08:49,176
in that some services are

187
00:08:49,256 --> 00:08:52,326
so that students using a Managed

188
00:08:52,326 --> 00:08:53,156
from our stores.

189
00:08:53,936 --> 00:08:56,796
There are also services such

190
00:08:56,956 --> 00:08:58,116
which can be enabled

191
00:08:58,116 --> 00:09:02,216
if the school decides they

192
00:08:58,116 --> 00:09:02,216
if the school decides they

193
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:02,756
All right.

194
00:09:02,756 --> 00:09:05,346
For you NDM vendors

195
00:09:05,346 --> 00:09:07,596
just as with the Device

196
00:09:07,596 --> 00:09:09,996
and the volume purchase

197
00:09:10,566 --> 00:09:12,386
to access this roster

198
00:09:12,386 --> 00:09:16,076
from Apple School Manager and

199
00:09:16,076 --> 00:09:18,666
to all the student and

200
00:09:19,046 --> 00:09:20,206
as well as the classes.

201
00:09:22,626 --> 00:09:25,106
In terms of the transition

202
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:26,996
from the Apple deployment

203
00:09:26,996 --> 00:09:29,786
to Apple School Manager,

204
00:09:29,786 --> 00:09:32,036
that they do not need

205
00:09:32,036 --> 00:09:33,586
It will continue to work.

206
00:09:34,386 --> 00:09:37,686
But your NDM solution needs to

207
00:09:38,426 --> 00:09:42,446
and be checking to see if their

208
00:09:42,446 --> 00:09:45,356
Manager type and

209
00:09:45,946 --> 00:09:48,216
which will actually be

210
00:09:48,216 --> 00:09:49,856
to the roster service

211
00:09:51,246 --> 00:09:53,756
On a parallel track,

212
00:09:53,756 --> 00:09:57,256
with the Device Enrollment

213
00:09:57,256 --> 00:09:59,856
that you now support

214
00:09:59,856 --> 00:10:01,086
that information in the header.

215
00:09:59,856 --> 00:10:01,086
that information in the header.

216
00:10:01,356 --> 00:10:03,496
And you'll receive the

217
00:10:03,496 --> 00:10:04,996
now available via that API.

218
00:10:07,326 --> 00:10:09,876
I also wanted to pass

219
00:10:09,876 --> 00:10:11,006
that my team has learned

220
00:10:11,006 --> 00:10:13,326
in adopting this API

221
00:10:14,526 --> 00:10:16,456
The first is really a

222
00:10:16,456 --> 00:10:18,596
that we think your customers

223
00:10:18,596 --> 00:10:21,836
If they have been using

224
00:10:21,836 --> 00:10:24,556
they've undoubtedly connected it

225
00:10:24,556 --> 00:10:28,026
and group information so

226
00:10:28,026 --> 00:10:29,616
representation for each user.

227
00:10:30,616 --> 00:10:32,936
Once you connect up to

228
00:10:33,076 --> 00:10:34,986
in Apple School Manager,

229
00:10:34,986 --> 00:10:37,006
to be getting a second

230
00:10:37,006 --> 00:10:38,376
in the form of the

231
00:10:38,376 --> 00:10:41,856
And we recommend that you

232
00:10:41,856 --> 00:10:43,476
to provide some matching

233
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:46,526
so that you can automatically

234
00:10:46,626 --> 00:10:49,746
into one representation of

235
00:10:50,536 --> 00:10:54,216
And because that matching won't

236
00:10:54,216 --> 00:10:58,076
we think you also should allow

237
00:10:58,076 --> 00:11:01,196
to be able to tell you this

238
00:10:58,076 --> 00:11:01,196
to be able to tell you this

239
00:11:01,196 --> 00:11:02,416
as this Managed Apple ID.

240
00:11:04,596 --> 00:11:07,636
One special note about

241
00:11:07,636 --> 00:11:12,096
by CSV uploads is that the

242
00:11:12,096 --> 00:11:15,426
in the CSV template becomes

243
00:11:15,426 --> 00:11:17,496
in the API results

244
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:21,056
That source system identifier

245
00:11:21,056 --> 00:11:24,476
like a student ID; it's not

246
00:11:25,076 --> 00:11:27,136
So that field can

247
00:11:27,136 --> 00:11:28,796
and is not guaranteed

248
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:30,756
And you need to be

249
00:11:31,186 --> 00:11:34,906
The final practice I wanted

250
00:11:34,906 --> 00:11:37,306
out that there is no delta

251
00:11:37,306 --> 00:11:40,556
to do a full enumeration to get

252
00:11:41,876 --> 00:11:44,956
Since the student information

253
00:11:44,956 --> 00:11:47,606
once per day between it

254
00:11:48,426 --> 00:11:50,946
there's no need to automatically

255
00:11:50,946 --> 00:11:51,936
than that frequency.

256
00:11:52,576 --> 00:11:56,186
And in fact, if you give

257
00:11:56,186 --> 00:12:00,956
to request a sync, you're going

258
00:11:56,186 --> 00:12:00,956
to request a sync, you're going

259
00:12:00,956 --> 00:12:03,686
that they're not overwhelming

260
00:12:05,356 --> 00:12:09,236
Turning from people to devices,

261
00:12:09,236 --> 00:12:11,306
to configure the Device

262
00:12:11,306 --> 00:12:12,546
for your school's devices,

263
00:12:12,996 --> 00:12:14,666
including finding

264
00:12:14,966 --> 00:12:17,266
configuring the details

265
00:12:17,516 --> 00:12:20,826
and then assigning devices

266
00:12:20,826 --> 00:12:23,156
when they're enrolled they'll

267
00:12:23,606 --> 00:12:25,966
And finally content.

268
00:12:26,536 --> 00:12:28,356
Apple School Manager

269
00:12:28,356 --> 00:12:31,016
to the Volume Purchase

270
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:33,726
and books, and it

271
00:12:33,726 --> 00:12:35,216
to iTunes U Course Manager.

272
00:12:35,746 --> 00:12:36,846
And I also wanted to mention

273
00:12:36,846 --> 00:12:39,446
that we recently

274
00:12:39,896 --> 00:12:42,576
which now supports integration

275
00:12:42,576 --> 00:12:45,096
to pull managed course

276
00:12:45,096 --> 00:12:50,696
Now let's talk about some of

277
00:12:50,696 --> 00:12:53,126
to getting your devices

278
00:12:56,186 --> 00:12:58,116
Last year I talked

279
00:12:58,116 --> 00:13:00,796
in iOS 9 called enrollment

280
00:12:58,116 --> 00:13:00,796
in iOS 9 called enrollment

281
00:13:01,186 --> 00:13:05,716
And just a recap this allows

282
00:13:05,716 --> 00:13:08,286
in the Device Enrollment

283
00:13:08,326 --> 00:13:09,386
that I want to you wait

284
00:13:09,386 --> 00:13:11,546
until I'm done configuring

285
00:13:11,546 --> 00:13:12,436
to use the device.

286
00:13:13,686 --> 00:13:15,916
That setting comes down to

287
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:17,236
in their DEP settings.

288
00:13:18,376 --> 00:13:21,516
It then sends a token

289
00:13:21,516 --> 00:13:22,956
to the MDM server,

290
00:13:22,956 --> 00:13:24,256
that I'm ready to be configured.

291
00:13:24,256 --> 00:13:27,426
The MDM server can then

292
00:13:27,426 --> 00:13:30,236
install as many configuration

293
00:13:30,236 --> 00:13:33,336
that device up to

294
00:13:33,866 --> 00:13:35,906
it then sends a device

295
00:13:35,906 --> 00:13:38,396
to the device, which then

296
00:13:38,496 --> 00:13:41,286
and allows the student or the

297
00:13:41,846 --> 00:13:43,756
This enables the

298
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:46,416
that that device is not used

299
00:13:47,636 --> 00:13:51,716
Now that we have Shared iPad,

300
00:13:52,046 --> 00:13:55,736
in that there's a new

301
00:13:56,276 --> 00:14:00,146
At that point the Shared iPad

302
00:13:56,276 --> 00:14:00,146
At that point the Shared iPad

303
00:14:00,146 --> 00:14:00,996
to the MDM server.

304
00:14:01,436 --> 00:14:03,326
But in contrast to

305
00:14:03,326 --> 00:14:04,836
about that's device-specific,

306
00:14:05,266 --> 00:14:08,016
this token update reports

307
00:14:08,016 --> 00:14:09,946
for the user who signed in.

308
00:14:10,696 --> 00:14:14,426
That enables the MDM server to

309
00:14:14,426 --> 00:14:16,096
as it needs to configure

310
00:14:16,096 --> 00:14:18,236
with any per-user

311
00:14:18,236 --> 00:14:19,156
into a bit more later.

312
00:14:20,566 --> 00:14:25,066
One crucial difference between

313
00:14:25,066 --> 00:14:28,086
and the device-specific

314
00:14:28,086 --> 00:14:31,576
that unlike the prior one

315
00:14:31,576 --> 00:14:34,516
until the MDM server is

316
00:14:34,516 --> 00:14:39,096
from completing sign in

317
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:43,786
A few security best practices.

318
00:14:43,786 --> 00:14:46,516
Those of you who have

319
00:14:46,516 --> 00:14:52,386
that we removed support for MD5

320
00:14:52,876 --> 00:14:57,236
We've also deprecated DES,

321
00:14:57,706 --> 00:15:01,946
So the message here is that your

322
00:14:57,706 --> 00:15:01,946
So the message here is that your

323
00:15:01,946 --> 00:15:05,496
or AES as soon as

324
00:15:05,496 --> 00:15:08,036
to be using the most

325
00:15:08,036 --> 00:15:10,526
and it's time to move

326
00:15:12,926 --> 00:15:15,776
Next, a few details about

327
00:15:15,776 --> 00:15:18,446
one of the other features of

328
00:15:18,446 --> 00:15:21,736
In iOS 9.3.2 we now allow you

329
00:15:21,736 --> 00:15:25,156
to skip the new True Tone

330
00:15:25,156 --> 00:15:26,676
on hardware which

331
00:15:28,776 --> 00:15:32,126
And new in macOS Sierra, we

332
00:15:32,126 --> 00:15:33,786
but in fact you might

333
00:15:33,786 --> 00:15:35,286
to configure them during setup.

334
00:15:35,286 --> 00:15:38,976
So you can skip the Siri or

335
00:15:39,486 --> 00:15:43,046
Now, this is another

336
00:15:43,046 --> 00:15:45,246
I think I've done this now,

337
00:15:45,296 --> 00:15:48,186
for you MDM vendors to

338
00:15:48,646 --> 00:15:51,646
which allows tools

339
00:15:51,856 --> 00:15:54,256
to obtain information

340
00:15:54,256 --> 00:15:57,066
such as the DEP enrollment

341
00:15:57,066 --> 00:15:58,836
to fetch the anchor certs.

342
00:15:59,206 --> 00:16:01,426
Profile Manager has supported

343
00:15:59,206 --> 00:16:01,426
Profile Manager has supported

344
00:16:01,426 --> 00:16:05,256
and Apple Configurator 2 takes

345
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:07,766
to simply enter the host

346
00:16:08,006 --> 00:16:09,576
and Configurator does the rest.

347
00:16:11,646 --> 00:16:13,456
Now let's talk about

348
00:16:15,456 --> 00:16:18,046
Of course, this brings

349
00:16:18,046 --> 00:16:19,476
to iPad in the classroom.

350
00:16:19,906 --> 00:16:22,126
A few details about

351
00:16:22,126 --> 00:16:24,476
And then I want to talk a

352
00:16:24,476 --> 00:16:25,806
of how it preserves user data.

353
00:16:28,026 --> 00:16:29,576
As I mentioned earlier,

354
00:16:30,286 --> 00:16:33,166
Shared iPad requires a

355
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:36,976
Once a student signs in

356
00:16:37,816 --> 00:16:40,796
she is also signed into her

357
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:44,016
as well as her iTunes

358
00:16:44,016 --> 00:16:47,206
which I'll talk about

359
00:16:47,326 --> 00:16:49,526
It's also used for

360
00:16:52,236 --> 00:16:55,346
Now, since there isn't

361
00:16:55,346 --> 00:16:58,306
into a Shared iPad,

362
00:16:58,306 --> 00:17:01,086
and install them using device

363
00:16:58,306 --> 00:17:01,086
and install them using device

364
00:17:01,086 --> 00:17:03,966
to VPP managed distribution

365
00:17:04,965 --> 00:17:07,425
MDM vendors hopefully have all

366
00:17:07,425 --> 00:17:09,596
but you'll need to use

367
00:17:09,816 --> 00:17:11,195
to support device assignments.

368
00:17:11,856 --> 00:17:14,526
All app types are

369
00:17:14,685 --> 00:17:16,955
to [inaudible] apps

370
00:17:17,566 --> 00:17:21,886
Although in order to distribute

371
00:17:22,205 --> 00:17:24,726
the developer of that app must

372
00:17:24,726 --> 00:17:27,326
and C's in iTunes Connect

373
00:17:29,946 --> 00:17:30,806
Now let's talk a little bit

374
00:17:30,806 --> 00:17:32,866
about the underlying

375
00:17:33,576 --> 00:17:36,056
As I mentioned, the student

376
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:37,076
that's where the truth is.

377
00:17:37,516 --> 00:17:40,186
But once they've signed into

378
00:17:40,356 --> 00:17:42,386
their data is downloaded

379
00:17:42,976 --> 00:17:44,816
However, that cache

380
00:17:44,816 --> 00:17:46,046
if additional students need

381
00:17:46,046 --> 00:17:47,736
to be accommodated

382
00:17:48,596 --> 00:17:50,726
Each student can only

383
00:17:52,516 --> 00:17:54,906
But if they generate a lot

384
00:17:54,906 --> 00:17:56,516
and they sign out before all

385
00:17:56,516 --> 00:17:58,706
of that data has successfully

386
00:17:59,326 --> 00:18:02,586
Shared iPad will continue to

387
00:17:59,326 --> 00:18:02,586
Shared iPad will continue to

388
00:18:02,586 --> 00:18:04,866
in screen or even if

389
00:18:06,056 --> 00:18:08,146
The key to all this

390
00:18:08,146 --> 00:18:09,656
of your apps are

391
00:18:11,036 --> 00:18:14,336
That primarily means that you're

392
00:18:14,336 --> 00:18:15,706
and settings in the Cloud.

393
00:18:16,316 --> 00:18:18,776
We've got a whole session right

394
00:18:18,776 --> 00:18:21,386
to make your app education

395
00:18:21,386 --> 00:18:23,156
and I encourage you

396
00:18:24,536 --> 00:18:27,716
Now, just kind of animation

397
00:18:28,746 --> 00:18:31,276
Student enters her pass code.

398
00:18:33,426 --> 00:18:35,456
Shared iPad gets her

399
00:18:36,296 --> 00:18:37,696
to the Home screen, excuse me.

400
00:18:38,146 --> 00:18:38,966
Downloads her data.

401
00:18:40,256 --> 00:18:42,866
See, she's working on her

402
00:18:42,866 --> 00:18:44,766
to sign out, to go

403
00:18:44,766 --> 00:18:45,566
or to go home for the day.

404
00:18:45,566 --> 00:18:53,886
Even back at the login screen

405
00:18:53,886 --> 00:18:55,466
Maybe she was working

406
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:59,066
But even if another

407
00:18:59,066 --> 00:19:01,886
and begins downloading his data,

408
00:18:59,066 --> 00:19:01,886
and begins downloading his data,

409
00:19:03,386 --> 00:19:05,206
the previous student's

410
00:19:05,296 --> 00:19:07,136
until it's all safely

411
00:19:08,216 --> 00:19:11,356
But the next student can

412
00:19:11,356 --> 00:19:11,826
right away.

413
00:19:15,016 --> 00:19:18,046
So what do you MDM vendors need

414
00:19:18,096 --> 00:19:20,116
Again, hopefully all of

415
00:19:20,116 --> 00:19:22,326
but for those of you who

416
00:19:23,106 --> 00:19:26,136
there's a new setting in the

417
00:19:26,136 --> 00:19:29,756
to supervision that tells

418
00:19:31,186 --> 00:19:33,446
You also will want to use

419
00:19:33,446 --> 00:19:34,916
that I talked about earlier

420
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:37,556
to set some key options

421
00:19:38,316 --> 00:19:40,186
And I'm going to go

422
00:19:40,186 --> 00:19:42,566
about both user quota and

423
00:19:44,786 --> 00:19:45,866
So what is the user quota?

424
00:19:46,516 --> 00:19:48,526
Well, it's the maximum

425
00:19:48,526 --> 00:19:50,436
which will be cached

426
00:19:50,766 --> 00:19:51,706
Let's say six.

427
00:19:53,906 --> 00:19:56,776
iOS will then automatically

428
00:19:56,776 --> 00:19:58,876
should be allocated

429
00:19:59,066 --> 00:20:01,706
taking into account

430
00:19:59,066 --> 00:20:01,706
taking into account

431
00:20:01,706 --> 00:20:03,696
as well as books and apps

432
00:20:04,956 --> 00:20:08,246
As users log in, their

433
00:20:08,246 --> 00:20:10,306
and cached on the Shared iPad.

434
00:20:11,386 --> 00:20:14,926
But in this case with a quota of

435
00:20:14,926 --> 00:20:19,006
one of the user data

436
00:20:19,226 --> 00:20:22,156
And we will purge the

437
00:20:22,306 --> 00:20:24,036
who doesn't have any

438
00:20:24,036 --> 00:20:25,026
to upload to the Cloud.

439
00:20:26,336 --> 00:20:29,616
Some guidelines on how to choose

440
00:20:29,616 --> 00:20:31,766
to try to get it close to

441
00:20:31,766 --> 00:20:34,176
who will actually use the

442
00:20:34,176 --> 00:20:35,826
which will typically

443
00:20:35,826 --> 00:20:37,116
of class periods

444
00:20:37,796 --> 00:20:39,976
Because if you have too few,

445
00:20:40,266 --> 00:20:42,376
students will have their

446
00:20:42,376 --> 00:20:43,136
than necessary.

447
00:20:43,686 --> 00:20:45,656
And if you choose a number

448
00:20:45,656 --> 00:20:50,856
to allocate space that's not

449
00:20:50,856 --> 00:20:52,176
Lock screen grace period.

450
00:20:52,866 --> 00:20:55,546
So let's imagine we

451
00:20:55,646 --> 00:20:57,346
And this option gives

452
00:20:57,346 --> 00:20:59,866
to choose the right

453
00:20:59,866 --> 00:21:02,416
for their students and data

454
00:20:59,866 --> 00:21:02,416
for their students and data

455
00:21:02,996 --> 00:21:05,866
And I think it's easier to

456
00:21:05,866 --> 00:21:06,886
than for me to talk about it.

457
00:21:07,066 --> 00:21:09,376
Again, let's imagine we

458
00:21:10,976 --> 00:21:13,566
The teacher asks the students

459
00:21:14,646 --> 00:21:15,686
So the screen locks.

460
00:21:15,996 --> 00:21:17,566
Let's imagine she

461
00:21:17,566 --> 00:21:20,576
and after 30 seconds Mia

462
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:22,686
and she gets right back

463
00:21:22,686 --> 00:21:23,656
to enter her pass code.

464
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:26,756
Now let's imagine the

465
00:21:28,126 --> 00:21:30,056
and Mia swipes after

466
00:21:31,156 --> 00:21:33,006
She will be prompted to

467
00:21:33,256 --> 00:21:35,626
So, again, this offers an

468
00:21:35,626 --> 00:21:36,966
to choose that right balance.

469
00:21:40,266 --> 00:21:42,166
Another detail for

470
00:21:43,026 --> 00:21:46,856
iOS as part of Shared iPad now

471
00:21:46,856 --> 00:21:48,596
to the device channel

472
00:21:48,596 --> 00:21:50,946
to send MDM commands

473
00:21:52,186 --> 00:21:55,096
macOS has had a user

474
00:21:55,416 --> 00:21:56,376
And this is very similar

475
00:21:56,376 --> 00:21:57,976
but with some differences

476
00:21:58,986 --> 00:22:03,076
In fact, if your MDM solution

477
00:21:58,986 --> 00:22:03,076
In fact, if your MDM solution

478
00:22:03,356 --> 00:22:06,506
over the user channel to Macs,

479
00:22:06,506 --> 00:22:08,866
to iOS devices previously,

480
00:22:08,986 --> 00:22:11,126
But with iOS devices 9.3

481
00:22:11,266 --> 00:22:13,766
and later they will now

482
00:22:14,546 --> 00:22:16,976
There's a subset of

483
00:22:17,036 --> 00:22:20,426
which are able to be

484
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:21,626
which I'll cover in a moment.

485
00:22:22,786 --> 00:22:25,886
One important difference

486
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:29,616
and macOS is that no user

487
00:22:29,716 --> 00:22:33,286
before delivering those per-user

488
00:22:33,846 --> 00:22:36,016
So you should never send

489
00:22:36,016 --> 00:22:38,446
over user channel, and

490
00:22:38,606 --> 00:22:41,316
that no credentials are

491
00:22:41,896 --> 00:22:44,806
That includes the new

492
00:22:44,806 --> 00:22:46,516
that we introduced in iOS 9.3.

493
00:22:48,706 --> 00:22:50,786
As I mentioned, all

494
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:53,476
including that new Google OAuth

495
00:22:53,476 --> 00:22:56,146
on the user channel, as

496
00:22:56,206 --> 00:22:59,486
Home screen layout and Safari

497
00:22:59,486 --> 00:23:02,656
to the domains payload that

498
00:22:59,486 --> 00:23:02,656
to the domains payload that

499
00:23:03,116 --> 00:23:06,066
The existing restrictions

500
00:23:06,066 --> 00:23:09,086
on the user channel, including

501
00:23:09,086 --> 00:23:10,826
that was added in iOS 9.3.

502
00:23:11,126 --> 00:23:15,756
One important detail about

503
00:23:15,756 --> 00:23:19,066
at first seem confusing

504
00:23:19,066 --> 00:23:20,436
from how they have

505
00:23:22,066 --> 00:23:24,546
if a restriction's payload is

506
00:23:24,606 --> 00:23:27,946
and the user channel, they

507
00:23:27,946 --> 00:23:29,666
to compute an effective

508
00:23:30,266 --> 00:23:32,636
with the most restrictive

509
00:23:32,866 --> 00:23:34,086
This prevents a student

510
00:23:34,086 --> 00:23:35,986
from installing another

511
00:23:35,986 --> 00:23:38,796
without that setting and

512
00:23:38,796 --> 00:23:39,556
from that restriction.

513
00:23:40,966 --> 00:23:43,446
The reason this isn't really any

514
00:23:43,446 --> 00:23:45,406
multiple profiles have

515
00:23:45,406 --> 00:23:47,046
if delivered all

516
00:23:47,526 --> 00:23:52,476
And with that, I'd like to

517
00:23:52,476 --> 00:23:54,396
and give you a demo of

518
00:23:54,396 --> 00:23:56,436
of the other education features

519
00:23:56,786 --> 00:23:57,786
David, take it away.

520

521
00:23:58,516 --> 00:24:01,736
[ Applause ]

522
00:24:02,236 --> 00:24:02,776
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Todd.

523
00:24:03,846 --> 00:24:06,286
It's great to be here demoing

524
00:24:07,376 --> 00:24:10,196
Let's take a look at

525
00:24:10,196 --> 00:24:12,436
between a couple classes

526
00:24:13,816 --> 00:24:17,236
To start we'll look

527
00:24:18,026 --> 00:24:20,146
Now, you can see the

528
00:24:20,816 --> 00:24:22,886
We have some recent

529
00:24:23,286 --> 00:24:25,576
and then a class list that

530
00:24:25,576 --> 00:24:26,576
from to log in.

531
00:24:27,786 --> 00:24:30,646
When I want to log into this

532
00:24:30,646 --> 00:24:33,406
from the list, which is

533
00:24:33,406 --> 00:24:34,656
of students to choose from.

534
00:24:35,396 --> 00:24:38,386
If this isn't my class, I can

535
00:24:38,846 --> 00:24:42,256
select a separate class, again,

536
00:24:42,256 --> 00:24:43,496
of students we can choose from.

537
00:24:44,576 --> 00:24:48,186
Now, if I'm not in any class

538
00:24:48,186 --> 00:24:51,286
in using any Managed

539
00:24:51,286 --> 00:24:53,486
to the same organization

540
00:24:54,606 --> 00:24:57,186
But to demonstrate Shared

541
00:24:57,246 --> 00:24:58,256
to our recent users.

542
00:24:59,096 --> 00:25:02,656
Here we have Ava, a

543
00:24:59,096 --> 00:25:02,656
Here we have Ava, a

544
00:25:02,796 --> 00:25:05,586
a third-grader, who

545
00:25:05,586 --> 00:25:06,716
in their classes yesterday.

546
00:25:07,626 --> 00:25:09,306
The second grade class

547
00:25:09,636 --> 00:25:10,746
So let's log in as Ava.

548
00:25:11,806 --> 00:25:13,146
Now, when we log in and log

549
00:25:13,146 --> 00:25:15,706
out our video sync

550
00:25:15,706 --> 00:25:16,416
So I'll show you here.

551
00:25:17,226 --> 00:25:18,816
After she enters

552
00:25:20,106 --> 00:25:23,166
they'll authenticate against

553
00:25:23,166 --> 00:25:26,726
on the device, the iPad will

554
00:25:26,726 --> 00:25:28,216
on her personalized Home screen

555
00:25:28,216 --> 00:25:30,566
that the school has

556
00:25:31,026 --> 00:25:32,386
Now, while the video catches up,

557
00:25:32,536 --> 00:25:34,966
let's talk about how this

558
00:25:35,746 --> 00:25:37,946
The school configured

559
00:25:37,946 --> 00:25:39,226
for second and third-graders.

560
00:25:39,776 --> 00:25:41,726
They chose the apps

561
00:25:41,726 --> 00:25:44,696
in those grades would use and

562
00:25:44,696 --> 00:25:45,886
for each of the students

563
00:25:46,316 --> 00:25:49,566
that they would see every

564
00:25:49,616 --> 00:25:50,926
within that organization.

565
00:25:51,326 --> 00:25:53,196
So for Ava, as a second-grader,

566
00:25:53,256 --> 00:25:55,186
they've chosen these

567
00:25:56,276 --> 00:25:59,586
You can see iBooks

568
00:25:59,646 --> 00:26:02,596
because those are the most-used

569
00:25:59,646 --> 00:26:02,596
because those are the most-used

570
00:26:03,256 --> 00:26:05,566
In fact, Ava's been

571
00:26:05,606 --> 00:26:07,396
across a variety

572
00:26:07,396 --> 00:26:11,116
And you can see that all

573
00:26:11,116 --> 00:26:12,826
to this iPad from iCloud.

574
00:26:13,646 --> 00:26:16,826
Now, we can create more notes on

575
00:26:16,826 --> 00:26:18,336
and be available on other iPads.

576
00:26:19,076 --> 00:26:21,886
Today her class was

577
00:26:22,296 --> 00:26:23,426
Of course, it's a great topic.

578
00:26:24,046 --> 00:26:25,606
So let's help her

579
00:26:25,706 --> 00:26:26,826
to commemorate this session.

580
00:26:27,726 --> 00:26:29,056
In fact, let's take

581
00:26:31,916 --> 00:26:34,276
All right, everybody,

582
00:26:34,746 --> 00:26:34,886
&gt;&gt; WWDC.

583
00:26:35,556 --> 00:26:37,526
&gt;&gt; Woo-hoo.

584
00:26:38,266 --> 00:26:40,926
Perfect. Now she'll

585
00:26:42,216 --> 00:26:47,196
Unfortunately, it's time for her

586
00:26:47,446 --> 00:26:50,496
Now, when Ava logs out

587
00:26:50,536 --> 00:26:54,316
which applications are saving

588
00:26:54,316 --> 00:26:56,966
to be synced afterwards

589
00:26:56,966 --> 00:26:59,606
or when another user is

590
00:27:00,456 --> 00:27:02,906
So when we land back at

591
00:27:02,906 --> 00:27:05,896
in as another user, that

592
00:27:05,896 --> 00:27:06,606
in the background.

593
00:27:07,306 --> 00:27:10,096
For example, if we had been

594
00:27:10,096 --> 00:27:12,266
up to this point instead

595
00:27:12,746 --> 00:27:15,426
it would be given another

596
00:27:16,266 --> 00:27:17,596
Now a third grade

597
00:27:17,996 --> 00:27:19,506
and Liam is back at this device.

598
00:27:19,766 --> 00:27:24,126
So we'll log in as him.

599
00:27:24,336 --> 00:27:27,806
Again, after we enter his

600
00:27:27,806 --> 00:27:30,766
the iPad gets ready,

601
00:27:30,766 --> 00:27:32,486
or his personalized Home screen.

602
00:27:33,006 --> 00:27:35,766
For the third-graders the

603
00:27:35,766 --> 00:27:38,006
of the same application

604
00:27:38,636 --> 00:27:40,836
But they've also included a

605
00:27:40,986 --> 00:27:42,276
including the ones from iWork

606
00:27:42,626 --> 00:27:45,006
because the third-graders

607
00:27:45,006 --> 00:27:45,646
throughout the year.

608
00:27:46,146 --> 00:27:48,446
And they've also included

609
00:27:48,446 --> 00:27:50,166
so that the students

610
00:27:50,166 --> 00:27:51,336
for those presentations.

611
00:27:52,006 --> 00:27:53,436
So if you look at the dock,

612
00:27:53,746 --> 00:27:56,666
you'll see that Liam also

613
00:27:57,036 --> 00:27:58,796
but he now has Maps and Safari

614
00:27:59,206 --> 00:28:01,236
because the third-graders

615
00:27:59,206 --> 00:28:01,236
because the third-graders

616
00:28:01,236 --> 00:28:03,296
and history of the great

617
00:28:04,566 --> 00:28:07,366
Now, Liam needs to put together

618
00:28:07,366 --> 00:28:08,626
for a presentation

619
00:28:09,656 --> 00:28:12,826
And though Ava just used

620
00:28:13,046 --> 00:28:14,726
Liam does not see

621
00:28:15,556 --> 00:28:18,516
In fact, it looks like Liam has

622
00:28:18,766 --> 00:28:21,536
So let's help him

623
00:28:21,686 --> 00:28:22,576
We'll create a new note.

624
00:28:23,166 --> 00:28:25,196
And Liam's found

625
00:28:25,406 --> 00:28:26,566
that he'll be able

626
00:28:27,206 --> 00:28:30,246
So let's add one of those now.

627
00:28:30,246 --> 00:28:30,746
Oh, beautiful.

628
00:28:31,476 --> 00:28:32,596
California state flag.

629
00:28:33,246 --> 00:28:35,596
That's a great flag and a

630
00:28:36,116 --> 00:28:37,926
But unfortunately, class

631
00:28:38,156 --> 00:28:39,306
so Liam needs to log out.

632
00:28:41,406 --> 00:28:43,316
Thankfully, when he logs out,

633
00:28:43,646 --> 00:28:46,526
he knows that his data is being

634
00:28:46,526 --> 00:28:49,156
when he gets home and wants to

635
00:28:50,456 --> 00:28:53,836
Every day throughout the entire

636
00:28:53,836 --> 00:28:57,886
the same iPads to work on their

637
00:28:57,966 --> 00:28:59,116
and it's synced and available

638
00:28:59,116 --> 00:29:01,306
across multiple devices

639
00:28:59,116 --> 00:29:01,306
across multiple devices

640
00:29:01,816 --> 00:29:04,936
For Ava and Liam, that means

641
00:29:04,936 --> 00:29:07,326
on their projects wherever

642
00:29:07,766 --> 00:29:08,126
Thank you.

643
00:29:08,256 --> 00:29:08,956
Back to you, Todd.

644
00:29:09,516 --> 00:29:13,546
[ Applause ]

645
00:29:14,046 --> 00:29:15,896
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much, David.

646
00:29:16,696 --> 00:29:17,596
Just a brief recap.

647
00:29:17,666 --> 00:29:20,996
So David showed how you

648
00:29:20,996 --> 00:29:24,406
on Shared iPad's log in screen,

649
00:29:24,406 --> 00:29:27,376
of building up a list

650
00:29:27,376 --> 00:29:29,286
in with their Managed

651
00:29:30,036 --> 00:29:33,246
They had actually signed

652
00:29:33,636 --> 00:29:35,226
and demonstrated that Ava

653
00:29:35,226 --> 00:29:37,656
and Liam only see

654
00:29:37,906 --> 00:29:39,486
in Notes and over other app.

655
00:29:40,226 --> 00:29:43,116
And in fact, the school can

656
00:29:43,116 --> 00:29:44,736
of apps and Home screen layout

657
00:29:44,876 --> 00:29:46,196
for different groups

658
00:29:46,586 --> 00:29:49,596
Well, that concludes our

659
00:29:49,776 --> 00:29:51,716
Let's continue with

660
00:29:52,616 --> 00:29:55,036
We got a few changes to

661
00:29:56,386 --> 00:29:57,566
And let's get right to it.

662
00:29:58,246 --> 00:30:01,696
So there's a great new feature

663
00:29:58,246 --> 00:30:01,696
So there's a great new feature

664
00:30:01,866 --> 00:30:03,366
that allows MDM servers

665
00:30:03,366 --> 00:30:07,266
to programmatically link Managed

666
00:30:07,376 --> 00:30:09,556
to their Volume Purchase

667
00:30:10,236 --> 00:30:13,826
so that no invitation process

668
00:30:13,826 --> 00:30:17,986
that this account is coming

669
00:30:17,986 --> 00:30:19,936
that wants to distribute

670
00:30:20,686 --> 00:30:23,796
This, of course, does

671
00:30:23,796 --> 00:30:26,496
or Apple School Manager

672
00:30:26,496 --> 00:30:27,716
from the same organization.

673
00:30:28,396 --> 00:30:31,066
But as I mentioned earlier,

674
00:30:31,066 --> 00:30:33,826
to download any new

675
00:30:33,826 --> 00:30:35,916
to Apple School Manager,

676
00:30:37,516 --> 00:30:39,776
For you MDM vendors,

677
00:30:39,776 --> 00:30:44,226
that the school has different

678
00:30:44,226 --> 00:30:46,076
that appear to be from

679
00:30:47,626 --> 00:30:50,116
There is a dedicated error

680
00:30:50,116 --> 00:30:53,286
So you can try to

681
00:30:53,286 --> 00:30:56,426
and just catch the failure and

682
00:30:56,426 --> 00:30:59,166
"Hey, your tokens don't

683
00:30:59,166 --> 00:31:01,256
that before we can

684
00:30:59,166 --> 00:31:01,256
that before we can

685
00:31:02,016 --> 00:31:03,886
Of course, to give this

686
00:31:03,886 --> 00:31:05,356
you'll have to adopt

687
00:31:05,426 --> 00:31:07,006
which is already

688
00:31:07,726 --> 00:31:09,146
And this is going

689
00:31:09,146 --> 00:31:11,726
for distributing iBooks

690
00:31:11,886 --> 00:31:13,626
which we'll talk about next.

691
00:31:15,146 --> 00:31:18,746
So how can you get iBooks Store

692
00:31:19,266 --> 00:31:22,976
VPP books can only

693
00:31:22,976 --> 00:31:25,006
and cannot be distributed

694
00:31:25,566 --> 00:31:27,086
So the way it will work is

695
00:31:27,086 --> 00:31:30,236
that once you've

696
00:31:30,316 --> 00:31:34,766
to your Managed Apple IDs,

697
00:31:34,766 --> 00:31:36,626
into Shared iPad will

698
00:31:36,626 --> 00:31:37,706
in their iBook Bookshelf,

699
00:31:37,706 --> 00:31:39,796
and they can simply

700
00:31:39,926 --> 00:31:41,426
to get those bits.

701
00:31:42,306 --> 00:31:46,396
The good news is that the second

702
00:31:46,396 --> 00:31:49,446
to use that book on

703
00:31:49,446 --> 00:31:52,636
to immediately download because

704
00:31:52,636 --> 00:31:55,626
on the device and are only

705
00:31:55,666 --> 00:31:57,796
and bandwidth of

706
00:31:59,196 --> 00:32:02,516
In contrast, non-iBook

707
00:31:59,196 --> 00:32:02,516
In contrast, non-iBook

708
00:32:02,516 --> 00:32:05,856
or iBooks author documents or

709
00:32:05,856 --> 00:32:08,666
and managed just like

710
00:32:10,896 --> 00:32:14,386
Finally, a few important

711
00:32:14,386 --> 00:32:15,566
to how Enterprise apps

712
00:32:15,566 --> 00:32:17,666
with universal provisioning

713
00:32:17,666 --> 00:32:20,326
that were introduced

714
00:32:20,326 --> 00:32:21,576
to be somewhat confusing.

715
00:32:22,996 --> 00:32:26,196
These universal provisioning

716
00:32:26,196 --> 00:32:30,046
app to run even if that

717
00:32:30,046 --> 00:32:32,806
on the provisioning profile

718
00:32:32,956 --> 00:32:37,966
For this to work, it requires

719
00:32:37,966 --> 00:32:42,286
of that app signer, as well

720
00:32:42,286 --> 00:32:45,406
by Apple that that specific

721
00:32:45,406 --> 00:32:46,206
remains valid.

722
00:32:48,706 --> 00:32:51,946
So, again, when installing one

723
00:32:51,946 --> 00:32:54,856
than MDM, the user must

724
00:32:55,716 --> 00:32:59,486
However, if the device

725
00:33:00,156 --> 00:33:02,906
those apps are implicitly

726
00:33:02,906 --> 00:33:05,056
that they trusted

727
00:33:05,056 --> 00:33:07,126
when enrolling in MDM.

728
00:33:07,626 --> 00:33:08,826
However, the second piece

729
00:33:09,206 --> 00:33:11,856
that Apple must consider

730
00:33:11,856 --> 00:33:15,206
to continue to run requires

731
00:33:15,206 --> 00:33:18,736
to be online occasionally to

732
00:33:19,786 --> 00:33:22,906
Even MDM installed apps

733
00:33:22,906 --> 00:33:24,056
periodic validation.

734
00:33:24,676 --> 00:33:27,536
But an MDM server can

735
00:33:27,536 --> 00:33:29,776
"Go validate all of

736
00:33:30,366 --> 00:33:32,666
This is a really key

737
00:33:32,666 --> 00:33:35,386
such as an electronic flight

738
00:33:35,776 --> 00:33:37,946
that will be offline

739
00:33:37,946 --> 00:33:38,976
on a regular schedule.

740
00:33:39,606 --> 00:33:41,966
The MDM server can tell the

741
00:33:41,966 --> 00:33:44,776
to be offline, "Go ahead and

742
00:33:44,776 --> 00:33:45,846
that they continue to run."

743
00:33:46,336 --> 00:33:49,736
And in fact, for

744
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:52,456
and this is what we've done in

745
00:33:52,456 --> 00:33:53,266
that you just go ahead

746
00:33:53,266 --> 00:33:56,006
and automatically validate

747
00:33:56,006 --> 00:33:59,296
when fetching the

748
00:33:59,446 --> 00:34:03,146
that are not validated, and that

749
00:33:59,446 --> 00:34:03,146
that are not validated, and that

750
00:34:03,146 --> 00:34:03,496
the time.

751
00:34:06,076 --> 00:34:08,246
That concludes our

752
00:34:08,466 --> 00:34:10,456
And now let's move

753
00:34:10,456 --> 00:34:12,616
in device management

754
00:34:12,616 --> 00:34:15,116
in an ongoing basis to

755
00:34:15,585 --> 00:34:17,036
And to take us through

756
00:34:17,036 --> 00:34:19,726
like to invite Shubham Kedia

757
00:34:19,815 --> 00:34:20,386
Shubham?

758
00:34:21,516 --> 00:34:24,166
[ Applause ]

759
00:34:24,666 --> 00:34:25,366
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Todd.

760
00:34:25,866 --> 00:34:27,136
Good morning, everyone.

761
00:34:28,025 --> 00:34:30,076
I'm thrilled to be

762
00:34:30,076 --> 00:34:32,585
through some great new

763
00:34:32,585 --> 00:34:34,616
to both iOS and macOS this year.

764
00:34:35,976 --> 00:34:38,315
So let's start with iOS 9.3

765
00:34:38,826 --> 00:34:42,656
where we added some brand

766
00:34:42,656 --> 00:34:44,166
to go alongside Shared iPad.

767
00:34:45,346 --> 00:34:49,146
The settings command was

768
00:34:49,146 --> 00:34:51,545
to now specify the

769
00:34:51,716 --> 00:34:54,436
that can have local

770
00:34:54,436 --> 00:34:56,156
We saw Todd talk

771
00:34:57,346 --> 00:35:01,756
You can now also toggle

772
00:34:57,346 --> 00:35:01,756
You can now also toggle

773
00:35:03,076 --> 00:35:05,996
We added some commands that

774
00:35:05,996 --> 00:35:09,446
as well, such as the user list

775
00:35:09,446 --> 00:35:12,616
to get the list of all users

776
00:35:12,616 --> 00:35:14,546
and even get information

777
00:35:14,546 --> 00:35:16,046
or not they're logged

778
00:35:16,046 --> 00:35:18,366
or not they have data that's

779
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:21,096
as well as information

780
00:35:21,386 --> 00:35:22,686
and how much space they've used.

781
00:35:23,986 --> 00:35:25,986
There are new commands

782
00:35:26,276 --> 00:35:27,536
and delete users as well.

783
00:35:28,056 --> 00:35:33,936
9.3 also introduced MDM Lost

784
00:35:34,386 --> 00:35:36,186
Now, these aren't

785
00:35:36,486 --> 00:35:38,646
these work across all

786
00:35:38,646 --> 00:35:41,816
So you can rest assured that

787
00:35:41,816 --> 00:35:46,326
you can remotely enable MDM

788
00:35:46,326 --> 00:35:48,126
and phone number

789
00:35:48,126 --> 00:35:49,406
to get the device's location.

790
00:35:51,476 --> 00:35:53,976
For devices like Shared iPads

791
00:35:53,976 --> 00:35:56,286
where you don't have an Apple

792
00:35:56,556 --> 00:36:00,806
MDM Activation Lock is also a

793
00:35:56,556 --> 00:36:00,806
MDM Activation Lock is also a

794
00:36:00,806 --> 00:36:02,516
Now, before I move

795
00:36:02,516 --> 00:36:04,386
out these icons that

796
00:36:04,726 --> 00:36:07,566
These represent commands,

797
00:36:07,566 --> 00:36:09,486
or configuration

798
00:36:09,486 --> 00:36:11,736
to either Shared

799
00:36:11,886 --> 00:36:13,246
that you'll see throughout

800
00:36:13,246 --> 00:36:19,476
9.3 also introduced some

801
00:36:19,626 --> 00:36:22,766
that you allow to configure

802
00:36:22,766 --> 00:36:23,246
you want.

803
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:26,386
The education payload is used

804
00:36:26,386 --> 00:36:28,746
to configure both the

805
00:36:28,836 --> 00:36:30,046
as well as Classroom app.

806
00:36:31,016 --> 00:36:32,306
Notifications allows you

807
00:36:32,306 --> 00:36:34,546
to configure exactly the

808
00:36:34,546 --> 00:36:36,456
like for all applications.

809
00:36:37,196 --> 00:36:39,746
You can preapprove or deny

810
00:36:39,746 --> 00:36:42,976
that aren't even installed

811
00:36:43,026 --> 00:36:44,406
like sounds and badges.

812
00:36:45,426 --> 00:36:48,336
The Home screen layout

813
00:36:48,336 --> 00:36:50,526
in his demo earlier can be used

814
00:36:50,526 --> 00:36:52,656
to configure exactly

815
00:36:52,656 --> 00:36:55,676
and folders you'd like

816
00:36:57,426 --> 00:36:59,626
The lock screen message

817
00:36:59,626 --> 00:37:02,406
to specify a custom

818
00:36:59,626 --> 00:37:02,406
to specify a custom

819
00:37:02,406 --> 00:37:05,666
on the lock screen and the

820
00:37:07,836 --> 00:37:10,906
The exchange and mail payloads

821
00:37:11,536 --> 00:37:14,976
You can now choose whether

822
00:37:14,976 --> 00:37:18,416
of Mail Drop when sending

823
00:37:19,686 --> 00:37:23,066
The domains payload has been

824
00:37:23,066 --> 00:37:25,286
to now specify exactly

825
00:37:25,286 --> 00:37:28,806
for which Safari will offer to

826
00:37:29,476 --> 00:37:31,316
For you Enterprise

827
00:37:31,596 --> 00:37:33,356
we've updated the

828
00:37:33,356 --> 00:37:35,676
with some great new

829
00:37:36,256 --> 00:37:38,816
and the restrictions payload

830
00:37:39,136 --> 00:37:43,326
You can now restrict

831
00:37:43,556 --> 00:37:46,246
iCloud Photo Library,

832
00:37:47,466 --> 00:37:50,086
You can also choose whether

833
00:37:50,376 --> 00:37:55,376
to be monitored by teachers

834
00:37:55,636 --> 00:37:59,166
You can disable modification

835
00:37:59,166 --> 00:38:01,606
which you may have set using

836
00:37:59,166 --> 00:38:01,606
which you may have set using

837
00:38:02,076 --> 00:38:05,636
as well as -- and you also

838
00:38:05,636 --> 00:38:06,896
and hide specific apps.

839
00:38:07,426 --> 00:38:09,826
Again, we saw David use

840
00:38:09,926 --> 00:38:14,816
I'd like to talk a

841
00:38:14,816 --> 00:38:16,016
about the education payload.

842
00:38:16,156 --> 00:38:19,226
It's extremely important

843
00:38:19,226 --> 00:38:22,406
because not only does it

844
00:38:22,406 --> 00:38:25,616
and classes you see in the

845
00:38:25,996 --> 00:38:28,816
but it's also how Classroom

846
00:38:28,816 --> 00:38:31,046
and student devices should

847
00:38:32,456 --> 00:38:35,866
In this payload you'll specify

848
00:38:36,036 --> 00:38:38,106
and even be able

849
00:38:38,376 --> 00:38:39,976
for these students and teachers.

850
00:38:41,276 --> 00:38:43,316
You'll do so by specifying URLs.

851
00:38:43,316 --> 00:38:48,626
And it's important that

852
00:38:50,026 --> 00:38:53,226
When you update these photos,

853
00:38:54,786 --> 00:38:57,676
Only one such payload can

854
00:38:57,676 --> 00:38:59,996
and it's important

855
00:38:59,996 --> 00:39:02,466
and teacher devices

856
00:38:59,996 --> 00:39:02,466
and teacher devices

857
00:39:05,496 --> 00:39:08,096
So all these payloads that I've

858
00:39:08,096 --> 00:39:10,406
be applied at the device

859
00:39:10,406 --> 00:39:11,976
of the users on a Shared iPad.

860
00:39:12,606 --> 00:39:14,666
But there are five

861
00:39:14,666 --> 00:39:16,656
over the user channel per user.

862
00:39:17,576 --> 00:39:19,656
These include all of

863
00:39:19,656 --> 00:39:23,106
including the new Google

864
00:39:23,376 --> 00:39:26,486
Home screen layout, the domains

865
00:39:26,486 --> 00:39:30,096
for Safari auto fill domains, as

866
00:39:30,356 --> 00:39:32,226
with the ability to

867
00:39:34,426 --> 00:39:37,076
Next let's talk about iOS 9.3.2.

868
00:39:38,586 --> 00:39:41,706
Here we updated the settings

869
00:39:41,706 --> 00:39:43,156
or disable app analytics,

870
00:39:43,276 --> 00:39:45,406
as well as set the lock

871
00:39:46,216 --> 00:39:48,946
Of course, we also updated

872
00:39:49,106 --> 00:39:50,586
and SecurityInfo queries

873
00:39:50,896 --> 00:39:52,866
to return the correct

874
00:39:54,046 --> 00:39:55,466
One thing to note here is

875
00:39:55,466 --> 00:39:58,446
that the security info query

876
00:39:58,446 --> 00:40:02,016
lock grace period and pass code

877
00:39:58,446 --> 00:40:02,016
lock grace period and pass code

878
00:40:02,756 --> 00:40:06,286
The enforced value might be more

879
00:40:06,286 --> 00:40:10,346
from your MDM server since it

880
00:40:10,346 --> 00:40:11,666
while users are logged in.

881
00:40:15,516 --> 00:40:18,886
Now, one of the great uses

882
00:40:18,886 --> 00:40:19,976
for standardized testing.

883
00:40:20,396 --> 00:40:22,216
And we've had two great

884
00:40:22,216 --> 00:40:24,636
in past releases:

885
00:40:24,706 --> 00:40:26,186
and Autonomous Single App mode.

886
00:40:27,356 --> 00:40:29,876
These continue to work the

887
00:40:29,876 --> 00:40:31,006
on supervised devices.

888
00:40:31,736 --> 00:40:35,436
However, now with a new

889
00:40:35,436 --> 00:40:37,476
to your app, you

890
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:42,186
and also disable five system

891
00:40:42,186 --> 00:40:43,286
for your assessment app.

892
00:40:44,286 --> 00:40:47,276
These include things like

893
00:40:47,706 --> 00:40:50,946
keyboard shortcuts, predictive

894
00:40:51,606 --> 00:40:55,266
And for the first time the

895
00:40:55,266 --> 00:40:59,346
ability to enable this mode on

896
00:40:59,766 --> 00:41:03,356
Of course, we do

897
00:40:59,766 --> 00:41:03,356
Of course, we do

898
00:41:03,356 --> 00:41:04,936
on unmanaged unsupervised

899
00:41:04,936 --> 00:41:10,626
where you can simply reboot

900
00:41:10,816 --> 00:41:13,616
9.3.2 also added a

901
00:41:14,226 --> 00:41:16,576
to prevent users from disabling

902
00:41:16,576 --> 00:41:18,356
or enabling diagnostic

903
00:41:18,546 --> 00:41:19,736
which you may have set via MDM.

904
00:41:19,736 --> 00:41:24,396
Now let's talk about iOS 10.

905
00:41:25,896 --> 00:41:29,826
In iOS 10 we updated the

906
00:41:29,826 --> 00:41:32,286
and the LDAP payloads

907
00:41:32,546 --> 00:41:34,116
for communication service rules.

908
00:41:35,926 --> 00:41:40,236
We saw earlier this week the

909
00:41:40,236 --> 00:41:40,826
in iOS 10.

910
00:41:40,876 --> 00:41:41,956
And what this key allows you

911
00:41:41,956 --> 00:41:45,176
to do is specify a default

912
00:41:45,366 --> 00:41:48,826
when making audio calls to

913
00:41:50,496 --> 00:41:52,926
The lock screen message

914
00:41:52,926 --> 00:41:54,126
with new key names as well.

915
00:41:54,976 --> 00:41:57,756
Of course, it remains

916
00:41:57,756 --> 00:41:59,786
for administers creating

917
00:41:59,786 --> 00:42:02,646
but we like MDM vendors to

918
00:41:59,786 --> 00:42:02,646
but we like MDM vendors to

919
00:42:02,706 --> 00:42:04,246
as the old ones have

920
00:42:06,176 --> 00:42:10,456
The VPN payload now has support

921
00:42:11,766 --> 00:42:13,566
for IKEv2, as well

922
00:42:13,566 --> 00:42:15,976
to specify a timeout for IPSec.

923
00:42:16,776 --> 00:42:20,636
PPTP has also been removed

924
00:42:20,636 --> 00:42:22,496
and existing payloads

925
00:42:24,656 --> 00:42:26,866
The Wi-Fi payload saw

926
00:42:27,886 --> 00:42:32,086
You can specify if you want to

927
00:42:33,156 --> 00:42:35,726
and Cisco fast lane

928
00:42:36,216 --> 00:42:38,856
And for those of you who know

929
00:42:40,356 --> 00:42:43,116
Finally, the restrictions

930
00:42:43,736 --> 00:42:46,006
to prevent users from

931
00:42:46,136 --> 00:42:48,676
Now, this is extremely

932
00:42:48,996 --> 00:42:50,676
since Classroom relies

933
00:42:51,246 --> 00:42:53,156
to connect its student

934
00:42:56,256 --> 00:42:58,406
So here are some restrictions

935
00:42:58,836 --> 00:43:01,316
that were introduced before

936
00:42:58,836 --> 00:43:01,316
that were introduced before

937
00:43:01,836 --> 00:43:05,306
And we talked last year about

938
00:43:05,306 --> 00:43:09,176
like to deprecate these and

939
00:43:09,176 --> 00:43:10,606
on unsupervised devices.

940
00:43:11,946 --> 00:43:14,936
Now, that future iOS

941
00:43:14,936 --> 00:43:18,126
but we promise we are going

942
00:43:18,196 --> 00:43:21,196
So please note that these

943
00:43:21,196 --> 00:43:26,916
on unsupervised devices.

944
00:43:27,076 --> 00:43:28,816
Next let's talk about macOS.

945
00:43:29,876 --> 00:43:31,996
Earlier this year we

946
00:43:31,996 --> 00:43:34,996
to install software updates

947
00:43:35,356 --> 00:43:37,606
on Macs enrolled in the

948
00:43:38,326 --> 00:43:40,166
This is going to be

949
00:43:40,616 --> 00:43:43,256
when macOS Sierra is

950
00:43:43,256 --> 00:43:46,306
to install it on

951
00:43:46,536 --> 00:43:49,636
in Device Enrollment Program in

952
00:43:52,896 --> 00:43:56,546
New in macOS Sierra we also

953
00:43:56,546 --> 00:44:00,336
profile payload to

954
00:43:56,546 --> 00:44:00,336
profile payload to

955
00:44:00,336 --> 00:44:03,146
and added some new updates

956
00:44:04,506 --> 00:44:07,006
We brought some keys

957
00:44:07,246 --> 00:44:09,926
such as Apple Music,

958
00:44:10,406 --> 00:44:13,446
and iCloud Photo Library,

959
00:44:13,446 --> 00:44:16,296
that are specific to the

Find My Mac, and sharing to

961
00:44:22,906 --> 00:44:24,796
It's been my pleasure

962
00:44:24,916 --> 00:44:26,746
of these great features

963
00:44:26,866 --> 00:44:28,906
And with that, I'd like

964
00:44:29,516 --> 00:44:29,846
Thank you.

966
00:44:32,166 --> 00:44:32,526
&gt;&gt; Great job.

967
00:44:32,736 --> 00:44:35,826
Thanks. All right.

968
00:44:35,826 --> 00:44:36,886
Thank you very much, Shubham.

969
00:44:37,226 --> 00:44:39,656
Let's turn to our final

970
00:44:39,796 --> 00:44:43,246
And of course, the most exciting

971
00:44:43,306 --> 00:44:45,676
We talked a little

972
00:44:46,126 --> 00:44:48,916
and it offers some amazing

973
00:44:48,916 --> 00:44:50,546
carefully curated

974
00:44:50,546 --> 00:44:53,606
for teachers in the classroom.

975
00:44:53,606 --> 00:44:55,546
But instead of hearing

976
00:44:55,546 --> 00:44:57,486
you can read the

977
00:44:57,866 --> 00:45:00,896
I'd like to ask Shruti Gupta to

978
00:44:57,866 --> 00:45:00,896
I'd like to ask Shruti Gupta to

979
00:45:01,286 --> 00:45:01,886
Shruti?

[ Applause ]

981
00:45:08,076 --> 00:45:08,636
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Todd.

982
00:45:08,736 --> 00:45:15,056
I am so excited to show you one

983
00:45:15,506 --> 00:45:17,486
What you see here

984
00:45:17,566 --> 00:45:18,756
that is running Classroom on it.

985
00:45:18,756 --> 00:45:20,716
And there are a bunch

986
00:45:20,756 --> 00:45:22,596
that are configure

987
00:45:23,086 --> 00:45:25,446
And all my students are

988
00:45:25,446 --> 00:45:30,196
When the class begins, the

989
00:45:30,196 --> 00:45:33,556
to the iPads and then students

990
00:45:34,116 --> 00:45:36,766
For this demo the students are

991
00:45:36,766 --> 00:45:38,416
in since you've already

992
00:45:38,416 --> 00:45:39,856
in process during David's demo.

993
00:45:41,316 --> 00:45:43,406
Now, let's assume that I'm

994
00:45:43,496 --> 00:45:45,886
and today we'll be learning

995
00:45:46,396 --> 00:45:48,896
And for that I found a really

996
00:45:48,896 --> 00:45:49,986
to share with all my students.

997
00:45:49,986 --> 00:45:54,866
So I'm going to tap on

998
00:45:55,076 --> 00:45:56,856
and select the healthy

999
00:46:02,576 --> 00:46:05,496
And it's navigating;

1000
00:46:05,496 --> 00:46:09,796
on all student devices.

1001
00:46:09,796 --> 00:46:13,536
Okay. Looks like one

1002
00:46:13,756 --> 00:46:15,776
But if you look at

1003
00:46:15,776 --> 00:46:19,436
you can see that Classroom app

1004
00:46:19,436 --> 00:46:22,756
Safari, indicating that all

1005
00:46:22,756 --> 00:46:22,986
yeah?

1006
00:46:23,836 --> 00:46:27,326
And if you tap on the screens,

1007
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:30,326
up pretty much on

1008
00:46:30,326 --> 00:46:34,516
And I guess some are already

1009
00:46:35,726 --> 00:46:39,556
Kids, pay attention

1010
00:46:40,266 --> 00:46:42,266
[ Laughter ]

1011
00:46:42,516 --> 00:46:44,306
&gt;&gt; So for the next

1012
00:46:44,306 --> 00:46:45,916
to divide the students

1013
00:46:46,056 --> 00:46:49,326
So I'm going to tap on Class

1014
00:46:49,686 --> 00:46:52,376
add a bunch of students

1015
00:46:53,346 --> 00:46:56,596
and give the group a

1016
00:46:57,066 --> 00:47:01,586
Now when I launch

1017
00:46:57,066 --> 00:47:01,586
Now when I launch

1018
00:47:01,586 --> 00:47:03,426
into activities specific

1019
00:47:03,676 --> 00:47:05,376
let's say I want Green's group

1020
00:47:05,376 --> 00:47:07,586
to make a list of

1021
00:47:07,736 --> 00:47:10,146
I will open Notes app for them

1022
00:47:11,286 --> 00:47:13,496
so they can start

1023
00:47:17,766 --> 00:47:21,956
Okay? And while students

1024
00:47:21,956 --> 00:47:23,056
I want to see how they're doing.

1025
00:47:23,056 --> 00:47:25,506
So I'm going to go back

1026
00:47:25,906 --> 00:47:27,376
and observe their screen.

1027
00:47:28,766 --> 00:47:32,296
And it seems that Edison is not

1028
00:47:32,826 --> 00:47:33,956
Let's take a closer look.

1029
00:47:34,166 --> 00:47:37,486
I'm going to tap on

1030
00:47:38,076 --> 00:47:40,516
and clearly she is not

1031
00:47:40,516 --> 00:47:42,346
So I'm going to go back.

1032
00:47:43,446 --> 00:47:47,246
Now I can either lock her screen

1033
00:47:47,716 --> 00:47:52,146
to get her attention back in the

1034
00:47:52,146 --> 00:47:57,146
into Notes app by sliding

1035
00:47:57,146 --> 00:48:00,366
on the Notes so she

1036
00:47:57,146 --> 00:48:00,366
on the Notes so she

1037
00:48:01,996 --> 00:48:06,476
Once the class ends, I can bring

1038
00:48:06,476 --> 00:48:09,626
out all the students iPads

1039
00:48:12,896 --> 00:48:14,736
And all the students

1040
00:48:15,096 --> 00:48:15,546

1042
00:48:16,546 --> 00:48:17,406
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much, Shruti.

1043
00:48:17,406 --> 00:48:19,016
It was great of you

1044
00:48:19,016 --> 00:48:21,376
in this amazing stress

1045
00:48:21,376 --> 00:48:23,906
with the most iOS devices

1046
00:48:24,386 --> 00:48:25,196
Thank you very much.

1047
00:48:26,196 --> 00:48:27,016
So what did we see?

1048
00:48:27,166 --> 00:48:29,386
We saw Shruti use

1049
00:48:29,386 --> 00:48:33,516
on all the student iPads,

1050
00:48:33,516 --> 00:48:34,946
in addition to the

1051
00:48:34,946 --> 00:48:38,406
that Classroom creates

1052
00:48:38,406 --> 00:48:40,746
into an app to focus

1053
00:48:41,496 --> 00:48:44,926
view the students' screens to

1054
00:48:44,926 --> 00:48:48,056
and redirect as needed,

1055
00:48:48,056 --> 00:48:48,966
if they get off track.

1056
00:48:49,516 --> 00:48:53,416
So a few brief notes

1057
00:48:53,416 --> 00:48:56,546
that we make available to

1058
00:48:56,546 --> 00:48:58,076
for the Device Enrollment

1059
00:48:58,076 --> 00:49:01,356
and Volume Purchase Program,

1060
00:48:58,076 --> 00:49:01,356
and Volume Purchase Program,

1061
00:49:01,356 --> 00:49:04,466
to test their implementation of

1062
00:49:04,986 --> 00:49:06,726
especially handling

1063
00:49:06,726 --> 00:49:08,626
that may be very

1064
00:49:08,836 --> 00:49:11,736
to simulate any other way with

1065
00:49:13,066 --> 00:49:15,456
The simulators have been

1066
00:49:15,456 --> 00:49:16,896
of the new features

1067
00:49:17,346 --> 00:49:19,246
And as always, they're

1068
00:49:19,246 --> 00:49:20,216
on the Developer portal.

1069
00:49:20,376 --> 00:49:22,776
And I strongly encourage you to

1070
00:49:25,136 --> 00:49:26,736
That brings us to the

1071
00:49:28,006 --> 00:49:29,296
Just a few summary slides

1072
00:49:29,296 --> 00:49:32,276
to cover the key points

1073
00:49:32,966 --> 00:49:35,756
If you're a school

1074
00:49:35,756 --> 00:49:38,476
and use Apple School Manager

1075
00:49:38,476 --> 00:49:39,766
and content in your school.

1076
00:49:41,436 --> 00:49:45,586
Everyone can use the DEP

1077
00:49:45,586 --> 00:49:47,746
in their remote management

1078
00:49:48,206 --> 00:49:51,766
or you can also use

1079
00:49:51,766 --> 00:49:54,986
or to combine the two using

1080
00:49:54,986 --> 00:49:59,876
enrollment feature that

1081
00:49:59,876 --> 00:50:02,916
to Configurator and complete

1082
00:49:59,876 --> 00:50:02,916
to Configurator and complete

1083
00:50:02,916 --> 00:50:05,856
on the DEP settings without

1084
00:50:06,376 --> 00:50:10,026
If you're a school and

1085
00:50:10,026 --> 00:50:13,276
use Shared iPad with Managed

1086
00:50:13,886 --> 00:50:17,446
and everyone can use VPP managed

1087
00:50:17,446 --> 00:50:20,146
to devices or users

1088
00:50:20,146 --> 00:50:23,036
to allow your users to use

1089
00:50:24,406 --> 00:50:27,956
For MDM developers, please add

1090
00:50:27,956 --> 00:50:32,546
including the programmatic

1091
00:50:32,546 --> 00:50:35,826
for use with VPP, as well

1092
00:50:35,966 --> 00:50:37,786
that Shubham talked

1093
00:50:37,786 --> 00:50:39,706
in iOS 10 and macOS Sierra.

1094
00:50:40,476 --> 00:50:42,776
Updated documentation

1095
00:50:43,676 --> 00:50:47,836
And please, again, do test with

1096
00:50:49,066 --> 00:50:51,116
Last but not least,

1097
00:50:52,426 --> 00:50:54,226
we want you to get your

1098
00:50:54,676 --> 00:50:57,236
by storing your app's data

1099
00:50:57,806 --> 00:51:00,686
And you can simulate

1100
00:50:57,806 --> 00:51:00,686
And you can simulate

1101
00:51:00,916 --> 00:51:04,066
by testing using your app

1102
00:51:04,586 --> 00:51:06,626
And the session immediately

1103
00:51:06,626 --> 00:51:09,436
about best practices will

1104
00:51:09,436 --> 00:51:12,796
about what you need to do

1105
00:51:14,366 --> 00:51:17,236
Speaking of which, this is the

1106
00:51:17,236 --> 00:51:18,956
Again, right here

1107
00:51:20,816 --> 00:51:22,806
There's some great

1108
00:51:22,806 --> 00:51:26,556
on our website both for

1109
00:51:27,256 --> 00:51:30,776
and for Enterprise at

1110
00:51:30,996 --> 00:51:32,106
I encourage you to check it out.

1111
00:51:33,536 --> 00:51:35,576
And finally, there are

1112
00:51:35,576 --> 00:51:38,126
direct links to documentations,

1113
00:51:38,126 --> 00:51:42,226
at our WWDC 2016

1114
00:51:42,226 --> 00:51:43,496
for Session 303.

1115
00:51:44,026 --> 00:51:46,396
And with that, I will thank

1116
00:51:46,396 --> 00:51:48,726
and hope you have a

1117
00:51:48,906 --> 00:51:49,756
Thank you very much.
