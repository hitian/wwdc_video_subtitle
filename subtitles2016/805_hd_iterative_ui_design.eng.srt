3
00:00:29,056 --> 00:00:29,896
&gt;&gt; Good morning everyone.

4
00:00:29,966 --> 00:00:30,476
Wow it's loud.

5
00:00:30,986 --> 00:00:32,136
Thank you all for coming.

6
00:00:32,516 --> 00:00:33,786
We're really excited to be here.

7
00:00:34,366 --> 00:00:36,166
My name is Ryan Olshavsky.

8
00:00:36,256 --> 00:00:38,326
And with me down

9
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:41,056
We're designers on an

10
00:00:41,186 --> 00:00:44,076
where we make the Numbers,

11
00:00:44,386 --> 00:00:46,356
for Mac, iOS, and iCloud.

12
00:00:47,166 --> 00:00:51,506
Jon and I have been

13
00:00:51,826 --> 00:00:54,546
for quite a while both

14
00:00:54,856 --> 00:00:57,126
And if there's one thing

15
00:00:57,126 --> 00:01:02,636
of our years of experience, it's

16
00:00:57,126 --> 00:01:02,636
of our years of experience, it's

17
00:01:03,476 --> 00:01:05,946
And I know that sounds like

18
00:01:06,526 --> 00:01:08,136
because it's good

19
00:01:08,196 --> 00:01:09,326
if everybody believes this.

20
00:01:10,736 --> 00:01:14,066
And maybe some of you have seen

21
00:01:14,066 --> 00:01:15,226
well that doesn't look too hard.

22
00:01:15,986 --> 00:01:20,266
And you're right a lot of times

23
00:01:20,666 --> 00:01:21,486
or effortless.

24
00:01:22,216 --> 00:01:25,386
But what makes design difficult

25
00:01:25,386 --> 00:01:26,626
to answer to do it well.

26
00:01:27,376 --> 00:01:29,936
Questions like, what

27
00:01:31,256 --> 00:01:32,116
Who is it for?

28
00:01:33,356 --> 00:01:34,286
Does it actually work?

29
00:01:34,806 --> 00:01:36,396
And did we get it right?

30
00:01:38,936 --> 00:01:42,006
These questions do not

31
00:01:42,226 --> 00:01:44,486
And they're always

32
00:01:44,486 --> 00:01:46,126
for the most experienced

33
00:01:46,416 --> 00:01:49,576
And if you're a solo developer,

34
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:52,466
on your team, or if you just

35
00:01:52,466 --> 00:01:54,956
before, trying to answer

36
00:01:54,956 --> 00:01:55,926
daunting task.

37
00:01:56,386 --> 00:02:00,486
But we do it anyway, because

38
00:01:56,386 --> 00:02:00,486
But we do it anyway, because

39
00:02:00,986 --> 00:02:04,966
it's important and it can have

40
00:02:04,966 --> 00:02:07,726
of your app and on

41
00:02:09,036 --> 00:02:12,316
A poorly thought out design

42
00:02:12,476 --> 00:02:15,776
and obvious interaction

43
00:02:15,776 --> 00:02:17,796
and potentially embarrassing

44
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:20,796
A great design, on

45
00:02:21,146 --> 00:02:24,286
can transform an

46
00:02:24,906 --> 00:02:27,736
into something simple,

47
00:02:29,026 --> 00:02:29,896
Even when it's based

48
00:02:29,896 --> 00:02:33,686
on something extraordinarily

49
00:02:34,536 --> 00:02:38,556
Now unfortunately there are

50
00:02:39,396 --> 00:02:41,916
There's no magic button you

51
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:44,456
of disparate features

52
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:45,526
and successful product.

53
00:02:46,546 --> 00:02:47,976
Design is not effortless.

54
00:02:47,976 --> 00:02:51,986
It takes time, commitment,

55
00:02:51,986 --> 00:02:56,366
But the good news is there are

56
00:02:57,116 --> 00:02:59,896
There are tools, techniques

57
00:02:59,896 --> 00:03:03,476
to mitigate uncertainty

58
00:02:59,896 --> 00:03:03,476
to mitigate uncertainty

59
00:03:03,606 --> 00:03:05,056
to a great design sooner.

60
00:03:05,996 --> 00:03:09,476
So today, Jon and I are going to

61
00:03:09,706 --> 00:03:12,446
and methods that we use on our

62
00:03:13,216 --> 00:03:16,456
to help you find answers

63
00:03:16,636 --> 00:03:19,236
Specifically, what

64
00:03:19,786 --> 00:03:21,696
Where do we start?

65
00:03:22,656 --> 00:03:25,426
And what's the right design.

66
00:03:25,576 --> 00:03:29,236
So first, what are we making?

67
00:03:29,306 --> 00:03:30,306
We're going to start

68
00:03:30,306 --> 00:03:33,046
because if you can answer this

69
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,706
questions a lot easier.

70
00:03:35,856 --> 00:03:38,686
So maybe you have a bunch

71
00:03:39,076 --> 00:03:41,696
but can't decide which

72
00:03:42,256 --> 00:03:45,336
Or maybe you've identified a

73
00:03:45,636 --> 00:03:48,006
but don't know exactly what

74
00:03:48,006 --> 00:03:49,216
in that audience want or need.

75
00:03:49,986 --> 00:03:51,956
Or maybe you've built a

76
00:03:51,956 --> 00:03:53,916
but don't know who

77
00:03:54,726 --> 00:03:58,186
A powerful way to answer those

78
00:03:58,986 --> 00:04:04,916
That is, take all the things you

79
00:03:58,986 --> 00:04:04,916
That is, take all the things you

80
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:07,666
Identify the features that

81
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:11,916
who will use your

82
00:04:12,436 --> 00:04:14,736
that serve your own

83
00:04:15,976 --> 00:04:19,995
in order to determine

84
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:24,066
So as an example, throughout

85
00:04:24,066 --> 00:04:25,386
to pretend to design an app.

86
00:04:26,006 --> 00:04:30,536
And how many of you here

87
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:33,736
Great. Well, if you haven't

88
00:04:33,736 --> 00:04:35,816
down in Apple Headquarters

89
00:04:35,886 --> 00:04:40,156
It has a rotating menu

90
00:04:40,156 --> 00:04:41,996
and most Apply employees

91
00:04:42,176 --> 00:04:46,106
But a lot of people walk down

92
00:04:46,106 --> 00:04:48,936
order their food, pay for their

93
00:04:48,936 --> 00:04:50,436
to their desk and eat there.

94
00:04:50,676 --> 00:04:52,936
So to make it a little

95
00:04:53,276 --> 00:04:55,176
we're going to design

96
00:04:55,176 --> 00:04:56,996
that lets employees order a meal

97
00:04:56,996 --> 00:04:59,026
and have it delivered

98
00:04:59,496 --> 00:05:00,166
Which is pretty cool.

99
00:04:59,496 --> 00:05:00,166
Which is pretty cool.

100
00:05:00,826 --> 00:05:04,266
So, fair warning, you're

101
00:05:04,536 --> 00:05:06,856
of food coming up, so if you

102
00:05:06,856 --> 00:05:09,426
or a snack before the

103
00:05:10,856 --> 00:05:13,216
So, let's go through the

104
00:05:13,276 --> 00:05:15,736
So like I said first,

105
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:20,516
and collect all the features

106
00:05:20,836 --> 00:05:23,076
So you want to include

107
00:05:23,116 --> 00:05:25,746
So we're pretty sure we'll

108
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:29,626
details about those entrees

109
00:05:29,626 --> 00:05:33,456
But you also, and include

110
00:05:33,456 --> 00:05:36,066
Capture all the features

111
00:05:36,066 --> 00:05:38,266
and your audience might

112
00:05:38,826 --> 00:05:41,596
So in our case we might want

113
00:05:42,336 --> 00:05:46,346
see ratings, quickly

114
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,956
Maybe we could offer

115
00:05:48,196 --> 00:05:48,786
And so on.

116
00:05:48,986 --> 00:05:51,826
There aren't any good or bad

117
00:05:51,996 --> 00:05:53,696
to include anything you want.

118
00:05:54,516 --> 00:05:56,856
And then once you have

119
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,986
to set it aside for a little bit

120
00:05:58,986 --> 00:06:01,896
to do is figure out

121
00:05:58,986 --> 00:06:01,896
to do is figure out

122
00:06:01,896 --> 00:06:03,146
for and what they need.

123
00:06:03,676 --> 00:06:05,766
Now this can often be

124
00:06:06,316 --> 00:06:09,396
because it's not uncommon

125
00:06:09,396 --> 00:06:12,466
to have completely

126
00:06:12,466 --> 00:06:14,906
about who is going

127
00:06:15,516 --> 00:06:18,256
But without a shared

128
00:06:18,756 --> 00:06:23,366
of who your user is, and what

129
00:06:23,366 --> 00:06:27,066
up with a hodgepodge of features

130
00:06:27,066 --> 00:06:29,316
you might spend a lot of time

131
00:06:30,006 --> 00:06:33,196
that nobody knows about because

132
00:06:33,926 --> 00:06:36,266
So let's start with a

133
00:06:36,266 --> 00:06:38,556
First, you are not the user.

134
00:06:38,736 --> 00:06:43,576
You might be a user of your app,

135
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:46,346
you risk building in

136
00:06:46,736 --> 00:06:47,626
about the user experience

137
00:06:47,626 --> 00:06:49,946
that might be completely

138
00:06:50,826 --> 00:06:54,386
For example, I'm an Apple

139
00:06:54,386 --> 00:06:56,406
of the Caffé Macs app

140
00:06:56,936 --> 00:06:59,486
but I almost exclusively

141
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:03,836
And if I were to design the

142
00:07:03,836 --> 00:07:06,176
I'd put the burger of the

143
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:08,306
and that would be it because

144
00:07:08,306 --> 00:07:13,386
And that would be great for me,

145
00:07:13,386 --> 00:07:16,996
who prefer salad, or who like

146
00:07:16,996 --> 00:07:18,486
that normal people eat.

147
00:07:20,056 --> 00:07:22,256
Designing for yourself

148
00:07:22,256 --> 00:07:24,616
from what matters

149
00:07:25,696 --> 00:07:27,316
But the opposite is also true.

150
00:07:28,526 --> 00:07:30,516
Your audience should

151
00:07:30,626 --> 00:07:32,486
because this is too

152
00:07:32,486 --> 00:07:34,896
to draw any meaningful

153
00:07:35,116 --> 00:07:38,226
about what would be most

154
00:07:38,226 --> 00:07:39,736
to the real people

155
00:07:40,676 --> 00:07:44,196
Instead you need to focus on

156
00:07:44,276 --> 00:07:45,576
of your target audience.

157
00:07:46,496 --> 00:07:48,476
And one way to do that is

158
00:07:48,476 --> 00:07:50,646
to image you're interviewing

159
00:07:50,646 --> 00:07:52,916
to use your app to

160
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:55,296
and what they don't like,

161
00:07:56,436 --> 00:08:00,796
In our case, we might ask our

162
00:07:56,436 --> 00:08:00,796
In our case, we might ask our

163
00:08:00,796 --> 00:08:02,616
meal, or something

164
00:08:02,896 --> 00:08:04,546
Do they like to take

165
00:08:04,746 --> 00:08:06,416
or just grab something

166
00:08:07,446 --> 00:08:09,246
Do they get the same

167
00:08:09,246 --> 00:08:11,736
Or do they like to try

168
00:08:12,226 --> 00:08:14,496
And do they prefer

169
00:08:14,496 --> 00:08:16,846
Or do they just pickup

170
00:08:17,856 --> 00:08:20,676
Try to capture a range

171
00:08:20,976 --> 00:08:22,206
in a few questions like these.

172
00:08:23,526 --> 00:08:29,126
And then pick the answers that

173
00:08:29,156 --> 00:08:30,226
to serve with your app.

174
00:08:31,346 --> 00:08:33,586
You can use your instinct

175
00:08:33,586 --> 00:08:36,106
and if you have user

176
00:08:36,106 --> 00:08:37,866
you can use that to

177
00:08:39,645 --> 00:08:42,626
In our case, it's already pretty

178
00:08:42,626 --> 00:08:44,346
and get a premade

179
00:08:44,736 --> 00:08:48,066
So, instead, we want to focus

180
00:08:48,066 --> 00:08:52,506
for a quick interesting, fresh,

181
00:08:53,436 --> 00:08:57,066
Once you know the

182
00:08:57,066 --> 00:08:59,156
of your customer, you

183
00:08:59,156 --> 00:09:00,026
as a set of goals.

184
00:08:59,156 --> 00:09:00,026
as a set of goals.

185
00:09:00,986 --> 00:09:04,916
So, our customer goals

186
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:06,586
eat quickly, or sorry.

187
00:09:06,586 --> 00:09:09,846
Enjoy a fresh meal, eat

188
00:09:10,066 --> 00:09:11,276
and make healthy choices.

189
00:09:12,086 --> 00:09:13,416
Articulating your

190
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:15,296
like this will help you focus

191
00:09:15,296 --> 00:09:17,376
on their needs throughout

192
00:09:19,496 --> 00:09:20,506
But what about you?

193
00:09:20,636 --> 00:09:24,366
What about your goals as an app

194
00:09:25,076 --> 00:09:27,786
Maybe you want people to

195
00:09:27,786 --> 00:09:32,326
Or maybe you want it to be a

196
00:09:32,326 --> 00:09:35,446
Or maybe you want it

197
00:09:35,826 --> 00:09:37,716
You want to capture those

198
00:09:37,926 --> 00:09:45,026
as app goals that describe what

199
00:09:45,026 --> 00:09:46,786
like, how it should feel

200
00:09:47,006 --> 00:09:49,596
and what makes it

201
00:09:51,396 --> 00:09:53,436
So our app goals might be

202
00:09:53,436 --> 00:09:56,876
to provide a convenient

203
00:09:56,926 --> 00:09:59,966
so people don't have to walk

204
00:10:00,046 --> 00:10:02,676
We want to highlight

205
00:10:02,986 --> 00:10:05,086
so customers know

206
00:10:05,086 --> 00:10:05,996
that are available to them.

207
00:10:06,886 --> 00:10:09,676
And we want Caffé Macs

208
00:10:09,986 --> 00:10:10,886
so they keep coming back.

209
00:10:10,966 --> 00:10:14,246
Now, note that this list

210
00:10:14,506 --> 00:10:17,486
be profitable, or earn a

211
00:10:18,156 --> 00:10:20,976
or optimize food costs.

212
00:10:21,826 --> 00:10:24,636
While those are important goals

213
00:10:25,026 --> 00:10:27,226
they don't really provide

214
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:28,646
for the design.

215
00:10:28,886 --> 00:10:32,976
And that's because business

216
00:10:32,976 --> 00:10:35,526
to get out of your app

217
00:10:36,296 --> 00:10:39,396
App goals on the other

218
00:10:39,396 --> 00:10:42,926
of experience you want

219
00:10:43,116 --> 00:10:45,676
You need to understand both

220
00:10:45,676 --> 00:10:49,186
But it's your app goals that

221
00:10:49,186 --> 00:10:50,986
to design and build

222
00:10:52,756 --> 00:10:54,716
All right so finally, to figure

223
00:10:54,716 --> 00:10:56,786
out what exactly

224
00:10:56,786 --> 00:10:59,106
we need to consider all those

225
00:10:59,286 --> 00:11:01,686
in step one from the perspective

226
00:10:59,286 --> 00:11:01,686
in step one from the perspective

227
00:11:01,686 --> 00:11:05,136
of our customer goals

228
00:11:05,266 --> 00:11:06,516
So, here's our list again.

229
00:11:07,376 --> 00:11:09,676
And by looking at each one

230
00:11:09,676 --> 00:11:12,996
of our goals, you can pretty

231
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:15,256
that are appropriate

232
00:11:15,256 --> 00:11:17,876
So, in addition to the

233
00:11:18,476 --> 00:11:21,436
we can also include an

234
00:11:21,736 --> 00:11:25,026
that serves our customers'

235
00:11:25,026 --> 00:11:25,876
and interesting to eat.

236
00:11:26,636 --> 00:11:28,896
And a feedback link

237
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:32,686
of making diners happy

238
00:11:32,686 --> 00:11:34,866
to let us know if

239
00:11:36,096 --> 00:11:38,826
By the same method we

240
00:11:38,826 --> 00:11:40,146
that do not serve our goals.

241
00:11:41,066 --> 00:11:42,976
Now this isn't to say

242
00:11:43,126 --> 00:11:44,846
or that they're not

243
00:11:45,156 --> 00:11:47,386
they just don't fit our

244
00:11:47,966 --> 00:11:50,536
So we can set them aside

245
00:11:50,536 --> 00:11:51,786
to them in a future release.

246
00:11:53,496 --> 00:11:54,826
All right, check this out.

247
00:11:54,826 --> 00:11:57,276
Now that we actually

248
00:11:57,276 --> 00:11:58,236
and we know what we're making.

249
00:11:58,236 --> 00:12:02,146
We have a nice succinct

250
00:11:58,236 --> 00:12:02,146
We have a nice succinct

251
00:12:02,146 --> 00:12:06,056
on a solid understanding of

252
00:12:06,116 --> 00:12:09,356
and what's going to matter to

253
00:12:10,226 --> 00:12:11,906
And so now to tell

254
00:12:11,906 --> 00:12:14,076
to actually start

255
00:12:14,076 --> 00:12:15,416
I'm going to hand

[ Applause ]

257
00:12:22,336 --> 00:12:22,886
&gt;&gt; Thank you Ryan.

258
00:12:23,466 --> 00:12:27,196
So now that know

259
00:12:27,196 --> 00:12:28,346
let's start designing our app.

260
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:30,256
But where do we start?

261
00:12:31,196 --> 00:12:36,326
Well what I like to do is I

262
00:12:36,326 --> 00:12:38,846
You might not know how all

263
00:12:38,846 --> 00:12:40,566
or work yet, but

264
00:12:40,566 --> 00:12:42,296
or two things you

265
00:12:42,606 --> 00:12:44,056
and you can start

266
00:12:44,656 --> 00:12:49,016
For example, if you're designing

267
00:12:49,016 --> 00:12:51,426
to start by designing

268
00:12:51,426 --> 00:12:53,246
because you know that's where

269
00:12:53,246 --> 00:12:54,076
to be spending their time.

270
00:12:54,826 --> 00:12:57,506
Or, if you're designing a

271
00:12:57,506 --> 00:13:00,096
by designing the profile

272
00:12:57,506 --> 00:13:00,096
by designing the profile

273
00:13:00,096 --> 00:13:01,816
that that's going to be a

274
00:13:03,336 --> 00:13:07,666
In our case, I'm designing

275
00:13:08,206 --> 00:13:10,156
So I don't know much

276
00:13:10,576 --> 00:13:13,906
but I know at the very least,

277
00:13:13,906 --> 00:13:15,726
so that people can

278
00:13:16,316 --> 00:13:18,466
So I'll start by

279
00:13:20,636 --> 00:13:24,546
So for this demo, I'm going

280
00:13:25,326 --> 00:13:28,036
You might already know Keynote

281
00:13:28,036 --> 00:13:31,786
but it's also a great

282
00:13:32,276 --> 00:13:34,706
It creates layouts very easily,

283
00:13:34,706 --> 00:13:36,516
you can try out different

284
00:13:36,826 --> 00:13:38,596
You can even make

285
00:13:38,596 --> 00:13:39,796
that you can load

286
00:13:40,826 --> 00:13:44,196
In our group, we like Keynote

287
00:13:44,196 --> 00:13:45,526
of our apps using Keynote.

288
00:13:46,376 --> 00:13:49,306
In fact, even Keynote was

289
00:13:50,906 --> 00:13:51,476
Think about that.

290

[ Applause ]

291
00:13:56,046 --> 00:13:57,506
That shouldn't even be possible.

292
00:13:58,566 --> 00:14:00,546
But it is because

293
00:13:58,566 --> 00:14:00,546
But it is because

294
00:14:01,546 --> 00:14:07,226
So, let's start drawing UI.

295
00:14:07,866 --> 00:14:11,536
UI is made up of a

296
00:14:11,836 --> 00:14:13,276
It's made up of shapes and lines

297
00:14:13,276 --> 00:14:15,276
and I can insert those

298
00:14:15,276 --> 00:14:17,206
I can just tap to

299
00:14:17,406 --> 00:14:18,996
I can tap to insert a line.

300
00:14:20,136 --> 00:14:21,486
UI also has text.

301
00:14:21,566 --> 00:14:23,476
And I can insert

302
00:14:23,476 --> 00:14:24,926
on this and get a textbox.

303
00:14:26,286 --> 00:14:28,346
And UI also has images.

304
00:14:29,146 --> 00:14:32,676
On my desktop I have

305
00:14:32,676 --> 00:14:34,096
and I can just drag

306
00:14:34,546 --> 00:14:37,066
And I can resize that.

307
00:14:38,376 --> 00:14:41,826
Great. So to start, I'm just

308
00:14:41,826 --> 00:14:43,306
I'm going to copy

309
00:14:43,376 --> 00:14:48,546
I'm going to change its

310
00:14:48,806 --> 00:14:50,856
because this is the

311
00:14:51,816 --> 00:14:56,706
And I'm going to make it white

312
00:14:56,786 --> 00:14:59,896

313
00:14:59,896 --> 00:15:00,306

00:14:59,896 --> 00:15:00,306

315
00:15:01,646 --> 00:15:02,566
It's a flashlight.

316
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:04,006
Ha,ha [laughter].

317
00:15:05,396 --> 00:15:06,086
I'm just kidding.

318
00:15:07,356 --> 00:15:10,496
So I'm going to draw a menu

319
00:15:10,496 --> 00:15:14,136
like to do is I like to take

320
00:15:14,136 --> 00:15:15,216
and use them as references.

321
00:15:15,616 --> 00:15:19,586
So here I have a screenshot

322
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:20,876
So I'm just going

323
00:15:21,136 --> 00:15:24,336
It comes in a little large

324
00:15:24,336 --> 00:15:27,386
So I'm just going to resize it.

325
00:15:27,386 --> 00:15:31,356
And I'm going to put this next

326
00:15:32,776 --> 00:15:35,016
And now that I have

327
00:15:35,016 --> 00:15:37,026
to what I'm drawing, I

328
00:15:37,266 --> 00:15:40,836
So I'm going to start by

329
00:15:40,836 --> 00:15:42,696
out the layout of my screen.

330
00:15:43,216 --> 00:15:47,426
So I'm just going to resize

331
00:15:47,826 --> 00:15:50,326
I turned on my accessibility

332
00:15:50,456 --> 00:15:52,846
in system preferences so I

333
00:15:53,026 --> 00:15:55,456
and make sure that

334
00:15:56,736 --> 00:15:59,896
Okay. I'm going to do

335
00:16:00,356 --> 00:16:05,546
I know that this

336
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:12,076
Again, I'm going to zoom

337
00:16:12,076 --> 00:16:16,686
in to make sure it is

338
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:20,346
Great and now I'm just going

339
00:16:20,466 --> 00:16:22,936
to start duplicating this

340
00:16:23,556 --> 00:16:27,716
I don't really care where

341
00:16:27,716 --> 00:16:28,746
I can be a little bit sloppy,

342
00:16:29,836 --> 00:16:30,996
because I'll clean

343
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:35,936
The only one I do care

344
00:16:36,016 --> 00:16:39,956
I want to make sure that

345
00:16:39,956 --> 00:16:41,886
where I want it.

346
00:16:42,106 --> 00:16:46,426
Great, because now I can

347
00:16:47,616 --> 00:16:50,976
and space them out evenly,

348
00:16:50,976 --> 00:16:52,436
So that was a really quick way

349
00:16:52,436 --> 00:16:53,666
to just get all my lines

350
00:16:55,526 --> 00:16:58,866
Oh, okay. That was not

351
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:02,726
So now I want to change

352
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:02,726
So now I want to change

353
00:17:02,726 --> 00:17:03,716
and I can do that here.

354
00:17:03,886 --> 00:17:04,945
I can make it gray.

355
00:17:05,296 --> 00:17:06,826
Or if I wanted to

356
00:17:06,826 --> 00:17:08,596
I could use the system

357
00:17:08,996 --> 00:17:10,096
and use the eyedropper tool.

358
00:17:11,076 --> 00:17:13,476
This turns my mouse

359
00:17:13,476 --> 00:17:16,516
and now I can click on a

360
00:17:16,796 --> 00:17:18,796
and it will use that

361
00:17:18,846 --> 00:17:21,606
And now I'll do the same

362
00:17:21,606 --> 00:17:23,086
I'll get this light gray.

363
00:17:24,106 --> 00:17:26,156
So I've already got the outline

364
00:17:26,156 --> 00:17:27,715
of the screen that

365
00:17:27,715 --> 00:17:30,846
So the next thing I want

366
00:17:31,136 --> 00:17:34,736
So I'm going to take this

367
00:17:34,736 --> 00:17:37,336
to match the style of the

368
00:17:37,336 --> 00:17:42,136
So I can start by just typing in

369
00:17:42,636 --> 00:17:45,126
You can see that the font

370
00:17:46,136 --> 00:17:50,556
I know that iPhone system

371
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:52,476
So I can set it to

372
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:55,536
And I'm just going to

373
00:17:56,476 --> 00:18:00,086
It looks like what I'm trying

374
00:17:56,476 --> 00:18:00,086
It looks like what I'm trying

375
00:18:00,196 --> 00:18:03,446
And I could actually

376
00:18:03,446 --> 00:18:05,586
and make sure that it is exact.

377
00:18:06,156 --> 00:18:07,936
Great. So it looks like

378
00:18:08,266 --> 00:18:11,666
I can do the same

379
00:18:21,456 --> 00:18:22,866
Close enough.

380
00:18:24,256 --> 00:18:28,406
Okay. So now I've got my

381
00:18:28,406 --> 00:18:31,586
on my screenshot, and

382
00:18:32,156 --> 00:18:37,016
maybe like it's gray so I'm

383
00:18:38,226 --> 00:18:39,666
So now the next thing I want

384
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:41,996
to do is start putting

385
00:18:41,996 --> 00:18:45,096
I've got this text file

386
00:18:45,096 --> 00:18:47,696
of different entree

387
00:18:47,696 --> 00:18:49,616
So I'm just going to copy and

388
00:18:57,126 --> 00:18:58,886
Resize this.

389
00:18:59,126 --> 00:19:04,326
Great. I also want to get

390
00:18:59,126 --> 00:19:04,326
Great. I also want to get

391
00:19:04,736 --> 00:19:08,656
So I'll try to match that.

392
00:19:09,386 --> 00:19:12,036
This looks like it's

393
00:19:12,626 --> 00:19:13,016
That's great.

394
00:19:14,146 --> 00:19:15,426
Stick this in the center.

395
00:19:17,996 --> 00:19:20,856
And I'll call this Caffé Macs.

396
00:19:22,186 --> 00:19:25,956
Okay. So now I've got some

397
00:19:26,826 --> 00:19:29,256
The next thing I want to

398
00:19:29,426 --> 00:19:33,886
I'm going to take my picture

399
00:19:35,026 --> 00:19:39,576
Now I want to get the

400
00:19:39,686 --> 00:19:40,846
So what I'm going

401
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:43,786
to use a shape and

402
00:19:44,296 --> 00:19:47,976
So I'm going to just make this

403
00:19:48,986 --> 00:19:53,936
And now, if I select

404
00:19:53,936 --> 00:19:58,936
I can crop the image

405
00:19:59,206 --> 00:20:02,156
Going to nudge it a bit.

406
00:19:59,206 --> 00:20:02,156
Going to nudge it a bit.

407
00:20:02,366 --> 00:20:02,756
Excellent.

408
00:20:04,076 --> 00:20:07,496
And now my picture of fish

409
00:20:08,606 --> 00:20:11,706
I can mask images in other ways.

410
00:20:12,056 --> 00:20:15,696
I want to get the status

411
00:20:15,696 --> 00:20:16,576
I don't want to draw it.

412
00:20:16,976 --> 00:20:19,196
So I'm just going to

413
00:20:19,196 --> 00:20:20,546
double click the mask it

414
00:20:20,926 --> 00:20:23,276
and just grab the bar

415
00:20:23,276 --> 00:20:25,896
I saved myself a

416
00:20:25,986 --> 00:20:30,636
And the last thing I want,

417
00:20:30,636 --> 00:20:31,886
I've got this other trick.

418
00:20:32,076 --> 00:20:34,496
I can actually take a

419
00:20:34,496 --> 00:20:39,016
of my screen using the

420
00:20:39,016 --> 00:20:40,106
control, shift 4.

421
00:20:40,626 --> 00:20:42,126
It's hard to remember,

422
00:20:42,126 --> 00:20:45,266
When I do that it turns my

423
00:20:45,756 --> 00:20:48,656
And now I can just draw

424
00:20:49,276 --> 00:20:54,156
And it's copied to my clipboard

425
00:20:54,156 --> 00:20:57,356
So that's a not well

426
00:20:58,646 --> 00:21:00,456
Great. So now I've got one row.

427
00:20:58,646 --> 00:21:00,456
Great. So now I've got one row.

428
00:21:00,456 --> 00:21:03,876
So I'm going to group

429
00:21:03,966 --> 00:21:06,976
And again, I'm going to do the

430
00:21:07,096 --> 00:21:10,846
The only one I care about

431
00:21:11,756 --> 00:21:16,746
because I can just

432
00:21:16,946 --> 00:21:18,886
space them out and align them.

433
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:22,926
Great. And now the

434
00:21:22,926 --> 00:21:27,176
to do is replace these images

435
00:21:27,176 --> 00:21:30,406
in there to get it

436
00:21:30,406 --> 00:21:34,026
To save some time I've actually

437
00:21:34,556 --> 00:21:38,316
So it looks something

438
00:21:38,316 --> 00:21:39,686
out all of the content.

439
00:21:40,706 --> 00:21:43,796
So in just I don't know, three

440
00:21:44,516 --> 00:21:50,546
[ Applause ]

441
00:21:51,046 --> 00:21:54,646
So I want to talk a little bit

442
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:55,826
in the last couple minutes.

443
00:21:56,386 --> 00:21:58,526
I started by using

444
00:21:58,916 --> 00:22:01,636
to match colors,

445
00:21:58,916 --> 00:22:01,636
to match colors,

446
00:22:02,146 --> 00:22:04,156
I also used screenshots

447
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:05,466
of UI that I wanted to use.

448
00:22:06,236 --> 00:22:09,316
I drew a bunch of squares and

449
00:22:09,316 --> 00:22:11,636
and I zoomed in and

450
00:22:11,636 --> 00:22:12,676
that they were pixel perfect.

451
00:22:13,126 --> 00:22:17,256
And I used believable content

452
00:22:17,256 --> 00:22:20,836
and texts to make my UI

453
00:22:22,146 --> 00:22:24,806
I think with a little

454
00:22:24,806 --> 00:22:27,066
and effort these steps

455
00:22:27,066 --> 00:22:28,886
that anyone here can

456
00:22:29,476 --> 00:22:31,686
So now I'll hand

457
00:22:33,516 --> 00:22:38,006
[ Applause ]

458
00:22:38,506 --> 00:22:39,366
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Jon.

459
00:22:39,646 --> 00:22:40,826
Great work as always.

460
00:22:42,546 --> 00:22:47,456
All right so here's our

461
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:49,466
And we're done.

462
00:22:49,566 --> 00:22:51,016
Right? This seems good enough.

463
00:22:51,306 --> 00:22:53,806
Meets all the functional

464
00:22:54,216 --> 00:22:54,736
Looks great.

465
00:22:55,236 --> 00:22:57,636
It's tempting to just

466
00:22:57,636 --> 00:22:59,956
onto the next feature

467
00:23:00,816 --> 00:23:02,786
But how do we actually know

468
00:23:02,826 --> 00:23:05,686
if this first design

469
00:23:06,886 --> 00:23:09,966
Well, I can tell you from

470
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:13,826
And that's because you can't

471
00:23:14,066 --> 00:23:15,276
if you try only one idea.

472
00:23:16,536 --> 00:23:19,486
Instead you need to look at

473
00:23:19,646 --> 00:23:26,556
and iterate on your design to

474
00:23:26,556 --> 00:23:27,876
that you might miss otherwise.

475
00:23:29,496 --> 00:23:33,016
Basically, you want to look

476
00:23:33,226 --> 00:23:34,296
what could we do differently?

477
00:23:35,086 --> 00:23:38,266
So here's our design again,

478
00:23:39,146 --> 00:23:42,546
Well, in our case, it's based

479
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:44,896
so one thing you can do is just

480
00:23:45,426 --> 00:23:48,246
Here by making the rows taller,

481
00:23:48,246 --> 00:23:49,646
but we can make the

482
00:23:50,446 --> 00:23:53,006
And you can also increase

483
00:23:53,006 --> 00:23:54,306
of information that's

484
00:23:54,306 --> 00:23:55,706
so here we've added the prices.

485
00:23:56,336 --> 00:23:59,796
You can consider different

486
00:23:59,796 --> 00:24:01,896
of white space between

487
00:23:59,796 --> 00:24:01,896
of white space between

488
00:24:01,896 --> 00:24:04,686
That's the space around

489
00:24:04,686 --> 00:24:05,436
that are on your screen.

490
00:24:05,546 --> 00:24:07,946
So here we've added margins

491
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:08,936
up the UI a little bit.

492
00:24:09,866 --> 00:24:11,966
You can also try

493
00:24:11,966 --> 00:24:15,766
For example, here we're using

494
00:24:16,226 --> 00:24:18,796
for the names, and we've

495
00:24:18,796 --> 00:24:20,506
to make them stand out on

496
00:24:21,086 --> 00:24:24,496
You can also just go where

497
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:27,076
So, we wondered, what it the

498
00:24:27,076 --> 00:24:28,226
of food, because why not?

499
00:24:28,596 --> 00:24:29,216
It's worth a try.

500
00:24:29,966 --> 00:24:32,766
But what we found is that

501
00:24:32,896 --> 00:24:36,576
on each row, we needed to

502
00:24:36,576 --> 00:24:39,066
and bolder, which gives

503
00:24:40,216 --> 00:24:42,036
And note that I'm not

504
00:24:42,036 --> 00:24:42,766
of these designs yet.

505
00:24:43,596 --> 00:24:45,756
We're just really brainstorming

506
00:24:45,756 --> 00:24:46,856
of shake out new ideas.

507
00:24:47,606 --> 00:24:50,726
So another technique you

508
00:24:50,726 --> 00:24:52,996
So while this design

509
00:24:54,046 --> 00:24:56,736
what about one that's

510
00:24:56,736 --> 00:24:58,246
So we have a grid

511
00:24:58,246 --> 00:24:59,926
It kind of looks like a

512
00:25:00,296 --> 00:25:03,366
You can also think about the

513
00:25:03,826 --> 00:25:06,756
and what shapes suit

514
00:25:07,096 --> 00:25:08,656
So while these photos

515
00:25:09,096 --> 00:25:11,196
maybe wider landscape

516
00:25:12,276 --> 00:25:14,806
You can also look at different

517
00:25:15,116 --> 00:25:17,356
Here each entrée is

518
00:25:17,676 --> 00:25:20,646
which helps them feel more like

519
00:25:22,536 --> 00:25:24,826
Think about how you use

520
00:25:25,096 --> 00:25:26,636
these photos are edge-to-edge,

521
00:25:26,816 --> 00:25:28,676
which makes the most

522
00:25:29,276 --> 00:25:31,416
And in this layout to

523
00:25:31,586 --> 00:25:33,846
we superimposed them

524
00:25:34,116 --> 00:25:36,346
to create a different

525
00:25:40,596 --> 00:25:42,256
And remember you

526
00:25:42,256 --> 00:25:44,886
to a uniform grid

527
00:25:45,156 --> 00:25:47,686
You can play with the size and

528
00:25:47,686 --> 00:25:51,326
to create completely

529
00:25:51,326 --> 00:25:53,016
You can combine ideas

530
00:25:53,016 --> 00:25:54,946
So, here we took the

531
00:25:55,106 --> 00:25:57,856
and merged it with the list

532
00:26:01,516 --> 00:26:04,246
Think about how immersive you

533
00:26:04,246 --> 00:26:06,786
These larger photos

534
00:26:07,086 --> 00:26:09,806
which encourages the viewer to

535
00:26:10,316 --> 00:26:14,406
And if your text is critical

536
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:15,396
to how readable it is.

537
00:26:15,756 --> 00:26:17,346
Can somebody with

538
00:26:17,346 --> 00:26:19,916
or color blindness make

539
00:26:20,486 --> 00:26:26,506
And finally what if we took this

540
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:30,116
so that the image takes up

541
00:26:31,276 --> 00:26:33,206
Here scrolling vertically

542
00:26:33,206 --> 00:26:37,246
so instead we're using a

543
00:26:37,246 --> 00:26:38,716
so you just swipe

544
00:26:39,996 --> 00:26:41,726
So, consider how your

545
00:26:41,726 --> 00:26:43,026
by different navigation schemes.

546
00:26:43,556 --> 00:26:47,886
All right so here

547
00:26:47,886 --> 00:26:48,956
to our original design.

548
00:26:49,286 --> 00:26:50,676
These were all drawn

549
00:26:51,556 --> 00:26:54,526
And you want to basically

550
00:26:54,526 --> 00:26:55,196
do differently?

551
00:26:55,596 --> 00:26:57,996
Until you've come

552
00:26:57,996 --> 00:27:00,686
as many interesting alternatives

553
00:26:57,996 --> 00:27:00,686
as many interesting alternatives

554
00:27:01,186 --> 00:27:05,746
And again you can do that

555
00:27:05,746 --> 00:27:08,416
into different layouts,

556
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:09,696
color, weight, and font.

557
00:27:10,566 --> 00:27:13,676
Experimenting with proportions

558
00:27:13,676 --> 00:27:14,576
and decreasing the amount

559
00:27:14,576 --> 00:27:16,066
of information that's

560
00:27:16,066 --> 00:27:19,736
Doing 180s and pushing

561
00:27:20,206 --> 00:27:21,406
And considering different ways

562
00:27:21,836 --> 00:27:23,156
of navigating through

563
00:27:23,686 --> 00:27:26,056
So the next question is,

564
00:27:26,476 --> 00:27:30,046
will any of these designs

565
00:27:30,206 --> 00:27:31,326
We don't know yet.

566
00:27:32,076 --> 00:27:35,026
This is a step when

567
00:27:35,076 --> 00:27:36,946
to actually judge your designs.

568
00:27:37,136 --> 00:27:38,256
This can be the fun part.

569
00:27:39,076 --> 00:27:40,896
So you want to set aside

570
00:27:40,896 --> 00:27:43,226
and forget all the time you

571
00:27:43,626 --> 00:27:46,366
And instead pretend you're a

572
00:27:46,716 --> 00:27:49,796
to evaluate and critique your

573
00:27:49,796 --> 00:27:51,846
and weaknesses, and

574
00:27:52,636 --> 00:27:57,306
So to do that you have to

575
00:27:57,476 --> 00:27:59,246
and ask some tricky questions.

576
00:28:00,406 --> 00:28:04,226
Things like, how well

577
00:28:04,226 --> 00:28:05,216
audience's goals?

578
00:28:05,626 --> 00:28:07,886
How well does it address

579
00:28:07,886 --> 00:28:10,386
And does it fit the

580
00:28:11,196 --> 00:28:14,616
Does the design provide people

581
00:28:15,016 --> 00:28:16,856
Is there enough detail

582
00:28:17,396 --> 00:28:18,016
Is it readable?

583
00:28:18,616 --> 00:28:21,136
Is the design intuitive?

584
00:28:21,396 --> 00:28:24,416
Are you using interface controls

585
00:28:24,916 --> 00:28:28,106
And are you using terminology

586
00:28:28,156 --> 00:28:30,046
given their context

587
00:28:30,476 --> 00:28:33,696
And finally, does the

588
00:28:34,646 --> 00:28:36,486
Even if it meets all

589
00:28:36,556 --> 00:28:38,376
and it's objectively

590
00:28:38,706 --> 00:28:40,276
does it feel the

591
00:28:40,276 --> 00:28:43,296
Does it have the personality and

592
00:28:43,296 --> 00:28:45,226
That's just as important

593
00:28:46,936 --> 00:28:48,926
These questions are

594
00:28:49,336 --> 00:28:51,426
And you will most likely

595
00:28:51,426 --> 00:28:54,676
with your teammates and even

596
00:28:54,906 --> 00:28:56,676
But asking these

597
00:28:56,676 --> 00:29:00,476
to answer them honestly

598
00:28:56,676 --> 00:29:00,476
to answer them honestly

599
00:29:00,476 --> 00:29:02,836
to the right design.

600
00:29:02,996 --> 00:29:05,196
So to demonstrate what

601
00:29:05,196 --> 00:29:08,746
and I are going to now critique

602
00:29:08,746 --> 00:29:11,896
of you, to find the one that

603
00:29:12,906 --> 00:29:16,186
So let's take a second

604
00:29:16,226 --> 00:29:18,936
All right what do you think Jon?

605
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:22,116
&gt;&gt; Looking at them side by

606
00:29:22,116 --> 00:29:25,016
that some are better than others

607
00:29:25,216 --> 00:29:26,596
and eliminate a couple

608
00:29:26,766 --> 00:29:26,936
&gt;&gt; Okay.

609
00:29:28,136 --> 00:29:29,946
&gt;&gt; Let's get rid of A,

610
00:29:29,946 --> 00:29:32,306
It's pretty good, but it's

611
00:29:32,506 --> 00:29:33,416
&gt;&gt; All right.

612
00:29:33,416 --> 00:29:34,416
&gt;&gt; Let's get rid of D,

613
00:29:34,616 --> 00:29:36,476
it doesn't have any photos,

614
00:29:36,636 --> 00:29:36,806
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

615
00:29:36,886 --> 00:29:38,956
&gt;&gt; A food app, we need photos.

616
00:29:39,026 --> 00:29:42,226
Let's also get rid of E.

617
00:29:42,226 --> 00:29:44,136
Yeah that one has

618
00:29:44,656 --> 00:29:46,976
It feels so crowded

619
00:29:46,976 --> 00:29:47,836
that much information.

620
00:29:48,426 --> 00:29:51,326
&gt;&gt; True. I think we

621
00:29:51,326 --> 00:29:52,886
It has a little bit

622
00:29:52,886 --> 00:29:55,176
but I think the visual layout

623
00:29:55,596 --> 00:29:57,486
and the entree names are getting

624
00:29:57,786 --> 00:29:58,316
&gt;&gt; That's a good point.

625
00:29:58,316 --> 00:30:00,886
&gt;&gt; I think we can get rid

626
00:29:58,316 --> 00:30:00,886
&gt;&gt; I think we can get rid

627
00:30:00,886 --> 00:30:03,436
of those photos are

628
00:30:03,436 --> 00:30:05,956
but you can't really see

629
00:30:06,066 --> 00:30:06,936
if it looks good or not.

630
00:30:07,276 --> 00:30:07,476
&gt;&gt; Okay.

631
00:30:07,576 --> 00:30:10,236
&gt;&gt; And then option L, even

632
00:30:10,546 --> 00:30:12,126
I think paging through 12

633
00:30:12,126 --> 00:30:14,526
or 15 different entrees

634
00:30:14,526 --> 00:30:16,766
to be too tedious so I think we

635
00:30:16,766 --> 00:30:17,076
&gt;&gt; I agree.

636
00:30:18,096 --> 00:30:20,776
&gt;&gt; All right now we're down

637
00:30:22,876 --> 00:30:24,146
All right [laughter].

638
00:30:26,586 --> 00:30:28,336
Didn't take very long at all.

639
00:30:28,336 --> 00:30:30,646
All right so let's look

640
00:30:30,646 --> 00:30:31,866
in a little more detail.

641
00:30:31,946 --> 00:30:34,856
So between these two,

642
00:30:34,856 --> 00:30:36,116
they're very functionally

643
00:30:36,116 --> 00:30:39,986
I would say that maybe option B

644
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:44,546
maybe more what people expect

645
00:30:44,546 --> 00:30:46,966
And I actually like the

646
00:30:46,966 --> 00:30:47,686
I think that's a nice look.

647
00:30:48,486 --> 00:30:50,006
&gt;&gt; You know I actually

648
00:30:50,006 --> 00:30:51,726
It's a little bit

649
00:30:51,946 --> 00:30:54,586
I like how the topography

650
00:30:54,586 --> 00:30:56,376
I think that's really hip now.

651
00:30:57,096 --> 00:30:58,806
It's also cool how all

652
00:30:58,806 --> 00:31:01,496
of the information is

653
00:30:58,806 --> 00:31:01,496
of the information is

654
00:31:01,616 --> 00:31:04,556
It's really each to just scan

655
00:31:05,176 --> 00:31:07,936
And I sort of like the

656
00:31:07,936 --> 00:31:10,896
and feeling a little

657
00:31:11,106 --> 00:31:13,246
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I think, yeah

658
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:13,536
Thank you.

659
00:31:13,536 --> 00:31:13,826
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

660
00:31:14,036 --> 00:31:14,736
&gt;&gt; You've convinced me.

661
00:31:14,896 --> 00:31:16,906
All right let's get

662
00:31:18,206 --> 00:31:22,366
This is totally ad lib

663
00:31:22,606 --> 00:31:24,366
&gt;&gt; Okay these two look

664
00:31:24,906 --> 00:31:26,276
they both have edge-to-edge

665
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:29,376
G has more of a grid layout,

666
00:31:29,376 --> 00:31:31,296
while H looks more

667
00:31:32,116 --> 00:31:34,386
I really like, I really like H.

668
00:31:34,386 --> 00:31:36,536
You know there's a lot of

669
00:31:36,746 --> 00:31:37,566
It feels really fun.

670
00:31:39,416 --> 00:31:42,256
&gt;&gt; [Sigh] Yeah H looks cool,

671
00:31:42,256 --> 00:31:44,266
which is that some of these

672
00:31:44,266 --> 00:31:44,686
than others.

673
00:31:44,686 --> 00:31:46,126
Like, we really want you

674
00:31:46,126 --> 00:31:47,966
to buy grilled mahi-mahi

675
00:31:48,296 --> 00:31:49,316
And that's not really the case.

676
00:31:49,316 --> 00:31:50,626
These should all

677
00:31:50,736 --> 00:31:53,996
I think if we like this style,

678
00:31:53,996 --> 00:31:55,846
with balancing this

679
00:31:55,846 --> 00:31:59,496
with the actual functional

680
00:31:59,786 --> 00:32:01,156
&gt;&gt; I still really like

681
00:31:59,786 --> 00:32:01,156
&gt;&gt; I still really like

682
00:32:01,886 --> 00:32:03,976
but I think you make

683
00:32:04,536 --> 00:32:04,946
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

684
00:32:05,046 --> 00:32:05,756
&gt;&gt; I think we should go with G.

685
00:32:05,756 --> 00:32:06,666
&gt;&gt; All right fair enough.

686
00:32:11,046 --> 00:32:13,076
All right so between these

687
00:32:13,076 --> 00:32:15,736
like I've said the edge-to-edge

688
00:32:16,086 --> 00:32:18,966
And I love that this reminds

689
00:32:18,966 --> 00:32:20,266
which I think is a

690
00:32:21,306 --> 00:32:23,466
&gt;&gt; Ryan, we are not designing

691
00:32:23,946 --> 00:32:25,736
we are designing a delivery app.

692
00:32:25,736 --> 00:32:27,046
You can't even see

693
00:32:27,126 --> 00:32:30,576
I like how K has a better

694
00:32:31,086 --> 00:32:34,456
Because it just seems more

695
00:32:34,456 --> 00:32:36,616
&gt;&gt; All right I see

696
00:32:36,926 --> 00:32:40,006
You gave me H, so

697
00:32:40,216 --> 00:32:40,546
All right.

698
00:32:40,866 --> 00:32:42,226
&gt;&gt; Okay, good.

699
00:32:42,576 --> 00:32:43,206
&gt;&gt; Compromise.

700
00:32:44,516 --> 00:32:47,596
[ Applause ]

701
00:32:48,096 --> 00:32:49,376
&gt;&gt; All right now we're

702
00:32:49,886 --> 00:32:52,036
what do you think?

703
00:32:52,036 --> 00:32:53,946
&gt;&gt; They look pretty good,

704
00:32:53,946 --> 00:32:56,066
by side, I think it's

705
00:32:56,066 --> 00:32:57,656
that G is not that great.

706
00:32:58,056 --> 00:33:00,876
These descriptions are

707
00:32:58,056 --> 00:33:00,876
These descriptions are

708
00:33:01,256 --> 00:33:03,466
of tell people what the food is.

709
00:33:03,996 --> 00:33:06,176
And G just seems really

710
00:33:06,926 --> 00:33:10,096
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Seeing them all

711
00:33:10,456 --> 00:33:12,506
Even though I love the

712
00:33:12,506 --> 00:33:13,416
having the descriptions,

713
00:33:13,416 --> 00:33:15,676
the more information really

714
00:33:15,676 --> 00:33:16,886
so I guess we'll get rid of G.

715
00:33:17,196 --> 00:33:17,446
&gt;&gt; Okay.

716
00:33:18,146 --> 00:33:19,966

in just a few minutes

718
00:33:22,336 --> 00:33:23,946
down to just two options

719
00:33:24,956 --> 00:33:27,106
These two are also very

720
00:33:27,726 --> 00:33:29,066
They both look great I think.

721
00:33:29,826 --> 00:33:33,446
They do have pretty

722
00:33:33,486 --> 00:33:36,306
I don't actually, I

723
00:33:36,306 --> 00:33:37,206
of these two, how about you?

724
00:33:37,936 --> 00:33:41,456
&gt;&gt; Well [laughter], oh

725
00:33:41,456 --> 00:33:42,976
They both look pretty good.

726
00:33:43,296 --> 00:33:43,476

And so maybe all

729
00:33:48,646 --> 00:33:53,166
So given all of the, now you've

730
00:33:53,166 --> 00:33:56,026

[ Cheering ]

737
00:34:13,076 --> 00:34:15,766
All right well I think

738
00:34:15,766 --> 00:34:17,146
which is pretty convenient

739
00:34:17,696 --> 00:34:23,036
All right so our

740
00:34:23,036 --> 00:34:27,226
Good job. So we've determined

741
00:34:27,226 --> 00:34:30,985
that option K is the

742
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:32,846
of functionality, efficiency,

743
00:34:32,846 --> 00:34:34,696
and the general feel we'd

744
00:34:35,606 --> 00:34:37,866
So now have we actually

745
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:41,835
Well, we're on our way, right,

746
00:34:42,315 --> 00:34:45,226
We now actually have to figure

747

00:34:53,286 --> 00:34:54,976
We need to design a workflow.

751
00:34:55,516 --> 00:34:58,356
A workflow is a set of steps

752
00:34:59,096 --> 00:35:02,436
In my case the task

753
00:34:59,096 --> 00:35:02,436
In my case the task

754
00:35:02,986 --> 00:35:07,266
So let's go back to the

755
00:35:07,806 --> 00:35:12,196
I think I'll take my

756
00:35:12,196 --> 00:35:13,136
with what I know here.

757
00:35:13,706 --> 00:35:15,506
I don't know much about

758
00:35:15,506 --> 00:35:18,266
but I do one thing,

759
00:35:18,266 --> 00:35:20,906
of those entrees I probably

760
00:35:20,906 --> 00:35:21,356
about that.

761
00:35:21,356 --> 00:35:24,696
So I'll go ahead and I'll

762
00:35:25,536 --> 00:35:27,406
And maybe it looks

763
00:35:28,756 --> 00:35:31,356
Okay. So now that I'm here,

764
00:35:31,356 --> 00:35:33,196
I probably need a

765
00:35:33,866 --> 00:35:35,786
So I'll put in an Order button.

766
00:35:36,416 --> 00:35:39,076
And maybe it will just go on the

767
00:35:39,916 --> 00:35:40,306
Excellent.

768
00:35:40,776 --> 00:35:44,016
And now what happens if I

769
00:35:44,816 --> 00:35:46,226
Well, I don't know.

770
00:35:47,486 --> 00:35:48,746
Maybe I'll just finish the order

771
00:35:48,956 --> 00:35:50,546
and let the user know

772
00:35:51,556 --> 00:35:53,206
So, I've designed a workflow.

773
00:35:53,796 --> 00:35:56,286
It looks pretty good.

774
00:35:56,716 --> 00:35:59,926
I think it gets the job

775
00:36:00,476 --> 00:36:02,466
But you know now

776
00:36:02,566 --> 00:36:03,796
I think there's some problems.

777
00:36:04,076 --> 00:36:06,686
It's actually missing a

778
00:36:06,936 --> 00:36:08,366
that we talked about before.

779
00:36:08,636 --> 00:36:12,846
You can't actually change order

780
00:36:12,846 --> 00:36:15,446
or when it's going to come,

781
00:36:15,566 --> 00:36:19,746
And now that I look at it, the

782
00:36:20,166 --> 00:36:23,356
After I hit the order button,

783
00:36:23,466 --> 00:36:25,156
There's probably

784
00:36:25,156 --> 00:36:26,366
that says you shouldn't do that.

785
00:36:27,096 --> 00:36:29,066
So I think there's

786
00:36:29,066 --> 00:36:30,646
that maybe this workflow

787
00:36:30,646 --> 00:36:31,646
so let's try that again.

788
00:36:32,096 --> 00:36:37,536
So, in a couple apps I've

789
00:36:37,536 --> 00:36:39,366
So I think I'm going to

790
00:36:39,866 --> 00:36:43,066
So in the upper right hand

791
00:36:43,066 --> 00:36:43,716
cart icon.

792
00:36:44,226 --> 00:36:47,936
And now if I tap in food

793
00:36:48,616 --> 00:36:50,536
And now I could tap that,

794
00:36:50,536 --> 00:36:52,226
the button will say it's

795
00:36:52,646 --> 00:36:54,606
And my icon will

796
00:36:54,606 --> 00:36:55,376
that there's something in it.

797
00:36:56,396 --> 00:36:58,046
It seems like a pretty

798
00:36:58,046 --> 00:36:58,926
so that's really nice.

799
00:36:58,926 --> 00:37:00,176
I think people will

800
00:36:58,926 --> 00:37:00,176
I think people will

801
00:37:00,866 --> 00:37:05,836
And now if I tap on the shopping

802
00:37:05,836 --> 00:37:07,016
summary of their order.

803
00:37:07,176 --> 00:37:11,086
And from here they could maybe

804
00:37:11,086 --> 00:37:13,226
to get a confirmation

805
00:37:13,226 --> 00:37:15,616
about to spend 11.68 for food.

806
00:37:16,436 --> 00:37:19,746
And now if they tap Place

807
00:37:19,746 --> 00:37:23,986
that the orders complete and

808
00:37:24,276 --> 00:37:26,366
So, now my work flow

809
00:37:27,146 --> 00:37:29,336
It addresses the problems

810
00:37:29,836 --> 00:37:33,106
It lets me know the

811
00:37:33,106 --> 00:37:36,056
and it does not make the

812
00:37:36,056 --> 00:37:38,026
It lets the user know

813
00:37:38,026 --> 00:37:39,046
so I think that's really nice.

814
00:37:40,566 --> 00:37:42,936
But you know I don't think this

815
00:37:43,306 --> 00:37:46,026
it's actually a whole lot of

816
00:37:46,026 --> 00:37:46,966
as ordering a sandwich.

817
00:37:47,316 --> 00:37:48,706
So I think we can

818
00:37:48,706 --> 00:37:52,306
And I actually noticed,

819
00:37:52,306 --> 00:37:55,586
that the menu screen

820
00:37:55,586 --> 00:37:58,426
of giving people

821
00:37:58,426 --> 00:38:01,306
and they might not have

822
00:37:58,426 --> 00:38:01,306
and they might not have

823
00:38:01,306 --> 00:38:03,406
to actually figure out

824
00:38:03,736 --> 00:38:06,826
So maybe the user can determine

825
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:09,116
to order the food right

826
00:38:09,526 --> 00:38:10,706
So let's try this again,

827
00:38:10,706 --> 00:38:11,976
let's try to make

828
00:38:14,176 --> 00:38:18,376
So here, I put the Buy buttons

829
00:38:18,456 --> 00:38:19,916
because that seems like

830
00:38:19,916 --> 00:38:22,496
And now if the user taps

831
00:38:23,656 --> 00:38:26,396
maybe we keep the shopping cart

832
00:38:26,396 --> 00:38:27,866
in the corner, it's

833
00:38:27,866 --> 00:38:28,836
that comes up on bottom.

834
00:38:29,626 --> 00:38:32,306
Here, I could actually show

835
00:38:32,306 --> 00:38:34,736
and even let them

836
00:38:34,736 --> 00:38:35,516
from the menu screen.

837
00:38:36,346 --> 00:38:38,906
If they want to I guess, they

838
00:38:38,906 --> 00:38:40,706
and see the full

839
00:38:40,706 --> 00:38:41,736
and the different options.

840
00:38:42,346 --> 00:38:45,206
But I think for the most part,

841
00:38:45,206 --> 00:38:47,246
for someone to figure

842
00:38:47,246 --> 00:38:48,016
to complete this order.

843
00:38:49,166 --> 00:38:52,286
And I could actually extend

844
00:38:52,286 --> 00:38:57,046
on the Order button, I could

845
00:38:57,396 --> 00:38:59,466
and show the confirmation

846
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:03,996
So now, the workflow

847
00:39:04,786 --> 00:39:07,136
It's three steps, but

848
00:39:07,136 --> 00:39:09,326
because all that's

849
00:39:09,966 --> 00:39:13,996
And it still has all

850
00:39:13,996 --> 00:39:17,796
as the previous design, but

851
00:39:17,796 --> 00:39:19,656
under the tray rather

852
00:39:19,656 --> 00:39:21,176
to be a mandatory

853
00:39:21,516 --> 00:39:24,496
So that's really nice.

854
00:39:24,496 --> 00:39:27,166
So I think this workflow

855
00:39:27,196 --> 00:39:29,216
I think it gets the job

856
00:39:29,216 --> 00:39:30,506
and I think it does

857
00:39:31,456 --> 00:39:35,196
Notice how to design this,

858
00:39:35,196 --> 00:39:36,306
that we talked about before.

859
00:39:36,306 --> 00:39:39,986
I started with what I knew and

860
00:39:39,986 --> 00:39:41,816
on all my designs until I ended

861
00:39:41,816 --> 00:39:44,456
up with something

862
00:39:44,456 --> 00:39:46,586
So now to wrap things up, let

Thank you, Jon.

865
00:39:52,976 --> 00:39:54,236
I can't wait to use

866
00:39:54,236 --> 00:39:57,996
All right so to wrap up, we

867
00:39:58,326 --> 00:40:01,176
I hope we've been able to convey

868
00:39:58,326 --> 00:40:01,176
I hope we've been able to convey

869
00:40:01,646 --> 00:40:04,326
First, good design is not easy.

870
00:40:04,596 --> 00:40:07,776
It can be a lot of fun,

871
00:40:07,846 --> 00:40:09,186
and thoughtful deliberation.

872
00:40:09,946 --> 00:40:12,096
But by using the methods

873
00:40:12,096 --> 00:40:13,476
it can be a little bit easier.

874
00:40:14,416 --> 00:40:16,806
If you're trying to figure out

875
00:40:17,606 --> 00:40:20,546
Define your audience's goals

876
00:40:20,606 --> 00:40:22,356
And then use those to

877
00:40:22,626 --> 00:40:24,146
that best serve everyone's

878
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:27,006
If you know what

879
00:40:27,006 --> 00:40:28,646
but don't know what

880
00:40:28,646 --> 00:40:30,476
or feel like, just

881
00:40:31,056 --> 00:40:32,916
Start with what you do

882
00:40:32,916 --> 00:40:34,746
It's okay if you don't have

883
00:40:34,746 --> 00:40:35,586
out ahead of time.

884
00:40:36,206 --> 00:40:38,956
And it's our completely unbiased

885
00:40:38,986 --> 00:40:41,096
we think you might like it.

886
00:40:41,406 --> 00:40:44,486
And finally to find the right

887
00:40:45,386 --> 00:40:47,116
Don't settle for

888
00:40:47,426 --> 00:40:49,226
or what might be good enough.

889
00:40:50,056 --> 00:40:52,126
Then critique your

890
00:40:52,126 --> 00:40:55,746
which options best suits

891
00:40:55,746 --> 00:40:56,646
and your app goals.

892
00:40:57,146 --> 00:41:00,346
Keep iterating and evaluating

893
00:40:57,146 --> 00:41:00,346
Keep iterating and evaluating

894
00:41:01,856 --> 00:41:03,786
So, we hope you'll

and methods back

896
00:41:05,416 --> 00:41:09,026
Give yourself the time

897
00:41:09,026 --> 00:41:10,166
and critique your designs.
