00:00:30,076 --> 00:00:30,686
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon.

4
00:00:32,375 --> 00:00:33,746
My name is Bruce Nilo.

5
00:00:33,836 --> 00:00:36,456
I'm an Engineering

6
00:00:36,856 --> 00:00:41,566
And today, my coworker, Mike

7
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:44,706
to talk to you about

8
00:00:44,706 --> 00:00:47,836
that we're introducing

9
00:00:48,526 --> 00:00:51,806
These APIs we're confident are

10
00:00:51,806 --> 00:00:54,876
for you to create natural,

11
00:00:54,946 --> 00:01:00,046
and responsive applications.

12
00:00:54,946 --> 00:01:00,046
and responsive applications.

13
00:01:01,026 --> 00:01:04,596
So we're going to begin our talk

14
00:01:05,046 --> 00:01:08,366
of the existing implicit

15
00:01:08,646 --> 00:01:09,836
that exist in UIKit.

16
00:01:10,596 --> 00:01:13,006
We're then going to dive

17
00:01:13,006 --> 00:01:16,256
that we are introducing

18
00:01:17,526 --> 00:01:19,986
We're going to talk about

19
00:01:19,986 --> 00:01:21,776
to view controller transitioning

20
00:01:22,046 --> 00:01:24,886
so that you can take

21
00:01:24,886 --> 00:01:29,476
Mike is going to come

22
00:01:29,476 --> 00:01:30,906
that uses these new APIs

23
00:01:30,906 --> 00:01:34,446
and a brand new sample Photos

24
00:01:34,446 --> 00:01:35,926
to download in the near future.

25
00:01:37,016 --> 00:01:40,226
We're then going to talk about

26
00:01:40,226 --> 00:01:43,346
to touch processing and hit

27
00:01:44,046 --> 00:01:45,916
and how you can use

28
00:01:45,916 --> 00:01:49,266
to create even interruptible

29
00:01:51,166 --> 00:01:58,096
So, implicit property animations

30
00:01:58,476 --> 00:02:02,736
to -- well, they exist

31
00:01:58,476 --> 00:02:02,736
to -- well, they exist

32
00:02:02,736 --> 00:02:04,786
to create a dynamic context

33
00:02:04,786 --> 00:02:08,306
by which you can update

34
00:02:08,306 --> 00:02:10,175
that can be animated over time.

35
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:17,766
It's an implicit API because

36
00:02:17,766 --> 00:02:18,826
on your behalf.

37
00:02:18,826 --> 00:02:23,066
It notes when the value changes

38
00:02:23,066 --> 00:02:28,186
and the end value to interpolate

39
00:02:28,186 --> 00:02:32,156
on the duration that you specify

40
00:02:32,156 --> 00:02:34,806
that specifies the

41
00:02:36,396 --> 00:02:38,006
So let's make this

42
00:02:38,696 --> 00:02:41,126
Here's a very simplified

43
00:02:41,326 --> 00:02:45,056
We're going to use this

44
00:02:45,056 --> 00:02:46,836
We have a circle

45
00:02:46,836 --> 00:02:48,036
from the left to the right.

46
00:02:48,886 --> 00:02:51,686
It's the center property of

47
00:02:51,686 --> 00:02:55,806
And when in this graph

48
00:02:55,806 --> 00:02:57,916
or a dotted square, it

49
00:02:57,916 --> 00:02:59,876
that you're actually

50
00:03:00,316 --> 00:03:03,466
Whereas the solid shape is going

51
00:03:03,466 --> 00:03:05,436
And we sometimes call

52
00:03:05,436 --> 00:03:06,896
versus the presentation value.

53
00:03:07,476 --> 00:03:12,696
So we start the animation,

54
00:03:12,696 --> 00:03:15,746
In fact, you'll notice that

55
00:03:16,716 --> 00:03:18,536
And the question is -

56
00:03:19,186 --> 00:03:20,366
Well, today it's really easy.

57
00:03:21,556 --> 00:03:22,886
Most of you are probably

58
00:03:22,886 --> 00:03:24,896
with the animateWithDuration

59
00:03:24,896 --> 00:03:30,256
And in this case, we're

60
00:03:30,256 --> 00:03:33,176
of the center of that circle

61
00:03:33,726 --> 00:03:39,466
Now the timing function that

62
00:03:39,706 --> 00:03:41,956
which basically means it

63
00:03:42,156 --> 00:03:45,386
Now a quick review of what a

64
00:03:45,836 --> 00:03:52,236
It's basically a cubic function

65
00:03:52,426 --> 00:03:54,056
with a couple of constraints.

66
00:03:54,056 --> 00:03:56,306
Namely, that at the

67
00:03:56,306 --> 00:03:58,586
meaning when you just started --

68
00:03:58,856 --> 00:04:01,346
the progress of the value

69
00:03:58,856 --> 00:04:01,346
the progress of the value

70
00:04:01,346 --> 00:04:03,366
in fact the start value.

71
00:04:03,886 --> 00:04:05,476
And at the end, it's

72
00:04:06,326 --> 00:04:12,186
Now timing functions that

73
00:04:12,186 --> 00:04:13,006
your animation.

74
00:04:13,376 --> 00:04:15,516
And it's really easy to see this

75
00:04:15,516 --> 00:04:19,136
with this exaggerated

76
00:04:19,755 --> 00:04:22,806
You'll notice that, halfway

77
00:04:23,326 --> 00:04:25,636
the progress has barely moved.

78
00:04:26,086 --> 00:04:28,716
It's really chugging

79
00:04:29,496 --> 00:04:32,396
We're almost 90%

80
00:04:32,836 --> 00:04:34,376
We're still only halfway there.

81
00:04:34,996 --> 00:04:37,966
It's in the last 10% of

82
00:04:37,966 --> 00:04:39,776
that we're going to make up

83
00:04:39,826 --> 00:04:41,756
Basically, this thing

84
00:04:41,976 --> 00:04:46,776
from a very slow pace to a

85
00:04:47,156 --> 00:04:48,846
So that's what timing

86
00:04:50,556 --> 00:04:55,386
UIKit currently really only

87
00:04:55,696 --> 00:04:58,596
These are specific instances

88
00:04:58,596 --> 00:05:00,766
There's the identity

89
00:04:58,596 --> 00:05:00,766
There's the identity

90
00:05:01,076 --> 00:05:02,406
There's .easeInOut.

91
00:05:03,876 --> 00:05:06,806
There is .easeIn.

92
00:05:08,366 --> 00:05:11,636
And finally, there's .easeOut.

93
00:05:11,636 --> 00:05:15,416
And these are very subtle

94
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:19,046
to kind of affect the

95
00:05:21,586 --> 00:05:23,426
Now what about springs?

96
00:05:24,156 --> 00:05:25,966
We also have an implicit

97
00:05:25,966 --> 00:05:27,996
where you can specify a spring.

98
00:05:28,606 --> 00:05:31,096
And you wouldn't be

99
00:05:31,096 --> 00:05:32,566
that's not really interpolating.

100
00:05:32,566 --> 00:05:34,856
We're kind of overshooting

101
00:05:34,856 --> 00:05:36,186
and kind of bouncing back."

102
00:05:37,076 --> 00:05:40,526
However, in what follows,

103
00:05:40,526 --> 00:05:43,876
to think about the spring as

104
00:05:44,486 --> 00:05:46,106
And let's see why

105
00:05:46,656 --> 00:05:48,986
Let's look at this

106
00:05:48,986 --> 00:05:53,966
where we're animating a

107
00:05:54,466 --> 00:06:00,046
And we're graphing effectively

108
00:05:54,466 --> 00:06:00,046
And we're graphing effectively

109
00:06:00,046 --> 00:06:01,666
as it proceeds over time.

110
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:03,466
And it kind of looks

111
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:05,376
The thing is it's not a cubic.

112
00:06:05,726 --> 00:06:09,876
It overshoots its values,

113
00:06:09,876 --> 00:06:12,406
as affecting the

114
00:06:12,626 --> 00:06:15,036
And in the APIs that follow,

115
00:06:15,036 --> 00:06:16,866
to classify spring animations.

116
00:06:18,146 --> 00:06:20,916
Now there is another

117
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:22,796
to animations in iOS 8.

118
00:06:23,296 --> 00:06:25,636
And I want to talk to you about

119
00:06:25,636 --> 00:06:27,006
at them again a little

120
00:06:28,556 --> 00:06:32,486
Basically, consider an

121
00:06:32,746 --> 00:06:34,356
in the midst of the animation.

122
00:06:34,356 --> 00:06:36,166
So you're going from one

123
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:37,726
And halfway through,

124
00:06:38,026 --> 00:06:40,886
Now prior to iOS

125
00:06:40,886 --> 00:06:42,896
there would be a discontinuity

126
00:06:43,116 --> 00:06:46,666
in the animation unless you

127
00:06:46,756 --> 00:06:49,416
UIViewAnimationOption

128
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:50,546
BeginFromCurrentState.

129
00:06:51,306 --> 00:06:53,946
And if you did that, it would

130
00:06:54,766 --> 00:06:56,676
There wouldn't be a

131
00:06:57,016 --> 00:06:58,546
but it wouldn't be

132
00:06:58,546 --> 00:07:01,056
The velocity changes

133
00:06:58,546 --> 00:07:01,056
The velocity changes

134
00:07:02,056 --> 00:07:07,536
In iOS 8, we made a significant

135
00:07:07,956 --> 00:07:10,546
for certain properties

136
00:07:10,546 --> 00:07:13,766
We didn't remove the previous

137
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:16,386
And then that smoothed out

138
00:07:17,596 --> 00:07:19,526
With the new

139
00:07:19,526 --> 00:07:22,806
it's going to be impossible to

140
00:07:25,436 --> 00:07:27,706
OK, let's get to

141
00:07:27,706 --> 00:07:29,986
that we have done

142
00:07:31,776 --> 00:07:32,796
Some of its features.

143
00:07:32,846 --> 00:07:33,786
It's really familiar.

144
00:07:34,136 --> 00:07:37,316
If you're familiar with the

145
00:07:37,316 --> 00:07:41,626
suite of APIs, you'll be right

146
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:43,586
It's interruptible.

147
00:07:43,586 --> 00:07:46,196
That means you can pause

148
00:07:46,906 --> 00:07:50,656
You can scrub them, meaning you

149
00:07:50,656 --> 00:07:53,376
like based on a programmatic

150
00:07:54,426 --> 00:07:55,326
You can reverse them.

151
00:07:55,376 --> 00:07:56,936
You can say, "Never mind.

152
00:07:56,936 --> 00:07:57,786
Go backwards."

153
00:07:58,496 --> 00:08:00,596
We're going to introduce

154
00:07:58,496 --> 00:08:00,596
We're going to introduce

155
00:08:00,596 --> 00:08:03,856
of timing functions, not just

156
00:08:03,856 --> 00:08:08,766
with one kind of small

157
00:08:09,826 --> 00:08:11,466
And finally, when the

158
00:08:11,466 --> 00:08:15,166
it'll be really easy to add

159
00:08:16,866 --> 00:08:21,906
So it's kind of hard to talk

160
00:08:21,906 --> 00:08:24,986
to do it by going into

161
00:08:25,276 --> 00:08:28,116
So let's get an overview of

162
00:08:28,436 --> 00:08:30,386
At the center of it all

163
00:08:30,386 --> 00:08:31,796
UIViewPropertyAnimator.

164
00:08:32,706 --> 00:08:36,426
It's implemented in terms

165
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:41,076
And the reason for implementing

166
00:08:41,076 --> 00:08:43,966
to two new protocols we'll

167
00:08:43,966 --> 00:08:46,286
when we couple it with view

168
00:08:47,116 --> 00:08:49,946
When you create a property

169
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:51,716
to create a new type of object

170
00:08:51,716 --> 00:08:54,886
which is effectively

171
00:08:54,886 --> 00:08:57,416
that you want that

172
00:08:57,506 --> 00:09:00,176
We provide two new

173
00:08:57,506 --> 00:09:00,176
We provide two new

174
00:09:01,206 --> 00:09:04,556
We've introduced a couple of

175
00:09:04,896 --> 00:09:07,766
by the methods defined

176
00:09:07,766 --> 00:09:08,876
For example, the state

177
00:09:08,986 --> 00:09:12,846
of an animator can be

178
00:09:13,266 --> 00:09:15,726
And we're going to be talking

179
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:19,966
We also introduced a

180
00:09:20,296 --> 00:09:21,956
where did the animation finish.

181
00:09:21,956 --> 00:09:24,876
Did it go all the way to the

182
00:09:24,876 --> 00:09:26,936
Did we reverse it and go

183
00:09:26,936 --> 00:09:31,006
Or maybe we interrupted it

184
00:09:31,996 --> 00:09:36,036
OK. We're going to

185
00:09:36,036 --> 00:09:37,856
on the center part

186
00:09:38,836 --> 00:09:39,986
We're then going to

187
00:09:39,986 --> 00:09:41,906
about all these new

188
00:09:43,676 --> 00:09:47,516
So let's look at kind of

189
00:09:47,756 --> 00:09:50,776
which is defined by the

190
00:09:50,776 --> 00:09:51,886
This is where all the fun is.

191
00:09:52,146 --> 00:09:53,536
It's really simple actually.

192
00:09:53,536 --> 00:09:56,616
There's a couple of properties

193
00:09:57,136 --> 00:09:59,636
For example, you can set

194
00:10:00,046 --> 00:10:01,536
You can tell an animation

195
00:10:01,536 --> 00:10:03,336
You can pause it,

196
00:10:03,386 --> 00:10:04,846
It's kind of self-explanatory.

197
00:10:06,316 --> 00:10:09,766
The next protocol adds the

198
00:10:09,766 --> 00:10:10,786
to this animator.

199
00:10:10,786 --> 00:10:14,456
It's where you add blocks

200
00:10:14,456 --> 00:10:16,896
of the properties that

201
00:10:17,276 --> 00:10:21,736
There's also an interesting

202
00:10:21,736 --> 00:10:24,926
which allows you to proceed

203
00:10:25,246 --> 00:10:28,306
with a completely

204
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:33,016
and possibly even a

205
00:10:33,876 --> 00:10:37,316
UIViewPropertyAnimator has

206
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:40,386
It also has some properties

207
00:10:40,386 --> 00:10:42,566
that we're going to get into

208
00:10:44,486 --> 00:10:48,956
So we're going to talk first

209
00:10:49,256 --> 00:10:51,576
We're going to talk about some

210
00:10:51,576 --> 00:10:53,946
so obvious that you might

211
00:10:53,946 --> 00:10:55,546
and scrub an animation.

212
00:10:56,456 --> 00:10:58,716
There's also some interesting

213
00:10:58,716 --> 00:11:00,416
of how you can reverse

214
00:10:58,716 --> 00:11:00,416
of how you can reverse

215
00:11:02,066 --> 00:11:03,086
Finally, we're going

216
00:11:03,086 --> 00:11:06,086
to introduce all the

217
00:11:07,096 --> 00:11:09,306
So let's start a

218
00:11:10,506 --> 00:11:12,406
And I've made this one a

219
00:11:12,406 --> 00:11:15,576
for pedagogical reasons

220
00:11:16,276 --> 00:11:17,936
And let's ask the question,

221
00:11:18,936 --> 00:11:21,456
"How would you use the

222
00:11:21,966 --> 00:11:23,356
And it's really, really easy.

223
00:11:23,726 --> 00:11:26,046
The first thing you do is

224
00:11:26,396 --> 00:11:31,596
This is just like the .easeInOut

225
00:11:31,596 --> 00:11:32,526
in the existing API.

226
00:11:33,296 --> 00:11:37,386
You instantiate one of these

227
00:11:37,956 --> 00:11:39,246
and the timing object.

228
00:11:40,476 --> 00:11:43,396
You add animations

229
00:11:43,396 --> 00:11:46,216
which are updating properties

230
00:11:46,816 --> 00:11:48,576
You can add an optional

231
00:11:48,956 --> 00:11:52,156
In this case, that completion

232
00:11:52,156 --> 00:11:52,836
to orange.

233
00:11:53,116 --> 00:11:55,276
And then you can start

234
00:11:56,586 --> 00:12:00,006
OK, it's kind of verbose

235
00:11:56,586 --> 00:12:00,006
OK, it's kind of verbose

236
00:12:00,006 --> 00:12:02,986
but now you have an

237
00:12:02,986 --> 00:12:04,116
of things you can do with it.

238
00:12:04,116 --> 00:12:06,076
It makes a world of difference.

239
00:12:07,396 --> 00:12:12,226
So let's look at some of the

240
00:12:12,226 --> 00:12:13,686
in UIViewPropertyAnimator.

241
00:12:13,836 --> 00:12:15,416
There's three that

242
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:17,746
There's the state, there's

243
00:12:18,056 --> 00:12:21,116
and whether it is running in the

244
00:12:21,526 --> 00:12:24,856
These are observable properties

245
00:12:24,856 --> 00:12:28,096
Now the first thing you do

246
00:12:28,216 --> 00:12:30,696
We're going to animate the

247
00:12:31,186 --> 00:12:34,876
Once you do and you've

248
00:12:35,466 --> 00:12:37,046
you can start the animation.

249
00:12:37,456 --> 00:12:38,846
The second you start

250
00:12:38,846 --> 00:12:40,906
the state changes,

251
00:12:41,286 --> 00:12:45,016
The values of the

252
00:12:45,016 --> 00:12:46,466
There is target value

253
00:12:46,466 --> 00:12:48,046
and there's what you

254
00:12:48,716 --> 00:12:50,726
And then the animation starts.

255
00:12:50,726 --> 00:12:53,266
Now what's different

256
00:12:53,266 --> 00:12:55,076
that animation halfway through.

257
00:12:55,386 --> 00:12:58,246
And to do that, I just

258
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:01,506
I can tell it that I

259
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:01,506
I can tell it that I

260
00:13:01,506 --> 00:13:02,786
in the opposite direction.

261
00:13:03,186 --> 00:13:04,916
I'm still paused when

262
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:06,076
that the states change.

263
00:13:07,146 --> 00:13:09,286
And then I can start

264
00:13:09,286 --> 00:13:11,026
to start going backwards.

265
00:13:11,726 --> 00:13:15,506
And then I can change it again,

266
00:13:16,236 --> 00:13:17,426
And when it completes,

267
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:20,146
we're going to call

268
00:13:20,146 --> 00:13:21,006
that you've registered.

269
00:13:21,006 --> 00:13:24,376
And in this time, we're

270
00:13:24,376 --> 00:13:27,866
because we made it all the

271
00:13:28,226 --> 00:13:30,476
If we hadn't reversed it

272
00:13:30,806 --> 00:13:33,166
we would have called the

273
00:13:33,216 --> 00:13:34,966
That way, your completion

274
00:13:34,966 --> 00:13:37,576
where the animation

275
00:13:38,096 --> 00:13:42,196
OK. Instead of pausing

276
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:44,386
there's something

277
00:13:44,696 --> 00:13:46,306
You can stop the animation.

278
00:13:46,656 --> 00:13:47,326
Now what does that mean?

279
00:13:48,016 --> 00:13:50,256
Well, the first thing you'll

280
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:53,186
that circle became

281
00:13:53,656 --> 00:13:57,336
We've effectively promoted what

282
00:13:57,376 --> 00:14:01,126
to the actual model value that's

283
00:13:57,376 --> 00:14:01,126
to the actual model value that's

284
00:14:01,856 --> 00:14:03,466
At that point, you can

285
00:14:03,466 --> 00:14:04,236
with that circle.

286
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:08,786
But we passed in a

287
00:14:08,786 --> 00:14:10,536
which means don't

288
00:14:10,536 --> 00:14:13,596
to the inactive states, stay

289
00:14:13,596 --> 00:14:16,116
And what that means is that,

290
00:14:16,116 --> 00:14:18,986
you're going to call

291
00:14:18,986 --> 00:14:23,886
to specify a position where the

292
00:14:23,886 --> 00:14:25,716
In this case, we're

293
00:14:25,716 --> 00:14:27,736
at the end or at the beginning.

294
00:14:28,206 --> 00:14:30,306
And you're completion

295
00:14:30,306 --> 00:14:31,156
with that position.

296
00:14:31,726 --> 00:14:34,396
Now if you called stopAnimation

297
00:14:34,396 --> 00:14:36,546
we wouldn't even call

298
00:14:36,596 --> 00:14:39,596
It's just finished

299
00:14:40,196 --> 00:14:41,476
Now let's look at what happens

300
00:14:41,476 --> 00:14:44,656
if you call

301
00:14:45,036 --> 00:14:46,756
Let's say we call

302
00:14:46,756 --> 00:14:51,416
It immediately jumps to

303
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:52,856
originally targeted.

304
00:14:53,496 --> 00:14:56,206
Now you might think, "Why

305
00:14:56,736 --> 00:14:59,966
And it actually gives you

306
00:14:59,966 --> 00:15:03,026
For example, imagine

307
00:14:59,966 --> 00:15:03,026
For example, imagine

308
00:15:03,186 --> 00:15:05,756
or you're stopping this

309
00:15:06,296 --> 00:15:07,936
and then you're dragging

310
00:15:07,936 --> 00:15:10,896
And maybe you set up

311
00:15:10,896 --> 00:15:14,296
in the end position and

312
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:17,726
And when you release it, based

313
00:15:17,946 --> 00:15:20,376
it may snap into those

314
00:15:20,646 --> 00:15:23,566
And once it reaches that, you

315
00:15:23,816 --> 00:15:25,746
with a .end or .begin.

316
00:15:25,956 --> 00:15:27,656
And so you can do some

317
00:15:27,656 --> 00:15:30,766
to finalize the animations

318
00:15:32,516 --> 00:15:39,876
[ Applause ]

319
00:15:40,376 --> 00:15:42,606
OK, pausing and scrubbing.

320
00:15:43,396 --> 00:15:44,856
Not much there, right?

321
00:15:45,566 --> 00:15:47,006
Well, it's kind of interesting.

322
00:15:47,006 --> 00:15:50,506
So there's a sample app here

323
00:15:51,356 --> 00:15:54,246
where we set some gesture

324
00:15:54,246 --> 00:15:56,036
that little green progress bar.

325
00:15:56,966 --> 00:16:00,646
And we can scrub

326
00:15:56,966 --> 00:16:00,646
And we can scrub

327
00:16:00,646 --> 00:16:03,186
We're updating where

328
00:16:03,186 --> 00:16:04,996
And then we can continue

329
00:16:05,656 --> 00:16:09,886
And you'll notice that kind

330
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:12,326
there's kind of a weird

331
00:16:12,326 --> 00:16:14,056
which we're going

332
00:16:15,586 --> 00:16:16,746
Before we do that, let's look

333
00:16:16,746 --> 00:16:18,586
at what these gesture

334
00:16:18,636 --> 00:16:21,926
On the square, we added

335
00:16:22,206 --> 00:16:24,736
which checks whether or not

336
00:16:25,106 --> 00:16:28,146
And if it is, it checks is

337
00:16:28,526 --> 00:16:30,216
And if it's running,

338
00:16:30,376 --> 00:16:32,356
And if it's not, it's

339
00:16:32,786 --> 00:16:33,776
Pretty straightforward.

340
00:16:35,066 --> 00:16:38,696
On the progress bar, we set

341
00:16:39,016 --> 00:16:41,916
And we're going to just compute

342
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:46,676
where we are in the pan relative

343
00:16:46,966 --> 00:16:50,326
to the full bounds

344
00:16:50,326 --> 00:16:52,346
And based on that fraction

345
00:16:52,516 --> 00:16:54,576
we're going to update

346
00:16:54,576 --> 00:16:56,826
and the progress bar

347
00:17:00,566 --> 00:17:07,806
OK. So, what's going

348
00:17:08,656 --> 00:17:10,976

00:17:24,086 --> 00:17:26,776
we pause the animation and

354
00:17:26,996 --> 00:17:31,856
The important thing to note

355
00:17:32,196 --> 00:17:35,476
that you're actually setting

356
00:17:35,476 --> 00:17:37,186
We've just paused the animation.

to the timing function of

Which means when we continue

368
00:18:09,936 --> 00:18:11,846
the animation is going

369
00:18:12,876 --> 00:18:16,226
So when we go back to the curve

370
00:18:16,226 --> 00:18:18,366
you'll notice that we're

There's three ways

379
00:18:41,486 --> 00:18:46,526
One is you can pause reverse --

380
00:18:46,996 --> 00:18:48,086
and start it up again.

381
00:18:48,746 --> 00:18:52,766
And you'll notice that you're

382
00:18:52,876 --> 00:18:55,406
through the timing function

383
00:18:55,896 --> 00:18:57,566
You can also reverse on the fly.

384
00:18:58,116 --> 00:19:00,096
Which means that, as the

385
00:18:58,116 --> 00:19:00,096
Which means that, as the

386
00:19:00,096 --> 00:19:01,286
you can tell it to reverse.

387
00:19:01,286 --> 00:19:03,386
And that's kind of like

388
00:19:03,796 --> 00:19:07,086
Again, there's going to be this

389
00:19:07,506 --> 00:19:10,446
And that might be what you

390
00:19:10,446 --> 00:19:14,416
of represent, say, a

391
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:15,396
or something like that.

392
00:19:16,056 --> 00:19:18,946
But if you don't want that and

393
00:19:19,276 --> 00:19:21,206
you can animate additively.

394
00:19:21,706 --> 00:19:25,406
And in this case, we will

395
00:19:25,406 --> 00:19:28,046
by changing the reverse

396
00:19:28,046 --> 00:19:31,896
to actually change the values

397
00:19:32,636 --> 00:19:34,796
Now what's different

398
00:19:34,796 --> 00:19:36,746

You're going back towards the

403
00:19:51,856 --> 00:19:57,126
OK, there's some

404
00:19:58,736 --> 00:20:01,476
that we've made available

The first is the

407
00:20:05,796 --> 00:20:08,556
If you create this class with

408
00:20:08,556 --> 00:20:11,916
to get the default core

409
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:14,836

of the cubic Bézier

on the unit square to you.

416

And as an example of

417

this particular Bézier curve,

up basically the

00:21:40,446 --> 00:21:42,616
that you specify is ignored.

It's not a scaler.

Most of the time, we're

450
00:22:03,076 --> 00:22:04,946
at the y component

451
00:22:05,446 --> 00:22:09,566
However, if you are animating

452
00:22:09,876 --> 00:22:11,856
we're actually going

453
00:22:11,936 --> 00:22:14,086
and y components of that vector.

454
00:22:14,086 --> 00:22:16,896
And to see why, look at

455
00:22:17,386 --> 00:22:19,736
where we drag a square

456
00:22:20,156 --> 00:22:22,336
And when we release it,

457
00:22:22,336 --> 00:22:24,836
to the center based on the

458
00:22:25,776 --> 00:22:31,496

connecting those two squares,

460
00:22:34,946 --> 00:22:38,366
because my gesture might be

00:22:41,186 --> 00:22:42,066
that into account.

But I'm going to give a quick

482
00:23:32,656 --> 00:23:34,986
of how we've extended

483
00:23:35,186 --> 00:23:37,806
View controller transitions

484
00:23:37,806 --> 00:23:39,166

485
00:23:39,166 --> 00:23:41,776

and animated transitioning

487
00:23:44,446 --> 00:23:46,886
that you create objects

488
00:23:47,486 --> 00:23:49,576
well, the objects that

489
00:23:50,746 --> 00:23:53,966
The system will create

490
00:23:53,966 --> 00:23:57,186
into the methods

00:23:59,546 --> 00:24:01,486
But let's remember why

494
00:24:01,486 --> 00:24:04,556
Imagine you have an app

495
00:24:05,726 --> 00:24:08,286
and the pop kind of looks OK.

496
00:24:08,286 --> 00:24:09,026

00:24:12,316 --> 00:24:14,326
But, you know, your app

499
00:24:14,716 --> 00:24:18,736
Your app wants to really kind

500
00:24:18,736 --> 00:24:20,806
something that explodes

501
00:24:20,806 --> 00:24:22,346
with a blur effect underneath.

00:24:22,906 --> 00:24:25,186
That's what custom view

503
00:24:25,216 --> 00:24:25,706
you do.

504
00:24:25,906 --> 00:24:27,796
And moreover, it

505
00:24:27,796 --> 00:24:29,316
and drive those interactively.

506
00:24:30,606 --> 00:24:33,536
OK. The way we get the

507
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:35,426
to these protocols are

508
00:24:35,546 --> 00:24:37,796
It might be the navigation

509
00:24:37,796 --> 00:24:39,286
or it might be a

510
00:24:39,286 --> 00:24:40,516
transitioning delegate.

511
00:24:40,676 --> 00:24:44,126
And we're going to ask that

512
00:24:44,126 --> 00:24:46,936
that conforms to animated

513
00:24:46,936 --> 00:24:49,036
present, or a push, or a pop?

514
00:24:49,606 --> 00:24:53,216
And if you do, we're going to

515
00:24:53,656 --> 00:24:54,556

516
00:24:54,556 --> 00:24:56,646
of these context

517

518
00:24:58,806 --> 00:25:00,876
to actually animate

00:24:58,806 --> 00:25:00,876
to actually animate

520
00:25:01,126 --> 00:25:03,196
And we're going to

521
00:25:03,436 --> 00:25:05,216
passing in that context to you."

522
00:25:05,856 --> 00:25:08,556
Now how do we make

523
00:25:08,556 --> 00:25:12,146
Well, what we've done is we've

524
00:25:12,186 --> 00:25:14,466
called

525
00:25:15,166 --> 00:25:18,306
And if you implement that,

526
00:25:18,306 --> 00:25:20,826
that conforms to

527
00:25:21,106 --> 00:25:23,456
Now this could be a

528
00:25:23,726 --> 00:25:24,936
but it doesn't need to be.

529
00:25:24,986 --> 00:25:28,376
It could be, for example,

530
00:25:28,376 --> 00:25:31,776
say, you implement in

531
00:25:31,776 --> 00:25:33,996
or some other animation

532
00:25:35,676 --> 00:25:41,676
If you do not implement

533
00:25:42,486 --> 00:25:44,906
meaning you only implement a

534
00:25:44,906 --> 00:25:47,036
then you need to

535
00:25:47,136 --> 00:25:50,976
And you would do so very

536
00:25:50,976 --> 00:25:54,186
You take the interruptible

537
00:25:54,696 --> 00:25:56,306
and you would basically

538
00:25:56,696 --> 00:25:58,186
And that's really

539
00:25:58,186 --> 00:25:59,726
to implement animateTransition.

540
00:26:01,266 --> 00:26:03,056
However, we kind of advise

541
00:26:03,056 --> 00:26:05,436
that you use an interaction

542
00:26:05,436 --> 00:26:06,646
to make it interruptible.

543
00:26:07,526 --> 00:26:11,966
And, again, the first thing

544
00:26:12,256 --> 00:26:14,456
or return an object

545
00:26:14,456 --> 00:26:15,946
to animated transitioning.

546
00:26:15,946 --> 00:26:18,306
We will then ask you for

547
00:26:18,306 --> 00:26:19,906
to interactive transitioning.

548
00:26:19,906 --> 00:26:22,796
And we're going to pass the

549
00:26:22,796 --> 00:26:24,966
to us previously as a parameter.

550
00:26:26,076 --> 00:26:29,626
Often times, you want that

551
00:26:29,626 --> 00:26:32,856
to actually drive the

552
00:26:33,006 --> 00:26:38,956
If you do, we're not going

553
00:26:38,956 --> 00:26:41,186
We're going to call

554
00:26:41,186 --> 00:26:43,016
and we're going to pass

555
00:26:43,016 --> 00:26:45,306
that we would have passed

556
00:26:47,956 --> 00:26:50,716
We provide a concrete

557
00:26:50,716 --> 00:26:52,516
that makes this really easy.

558
00:26:53,976 --> 00:26:57,146
Now there was a restriction

559
00:26:57,146 --> 00:26:59,866
where if you implemented

560
00:26:59,866 --> 00:27:00,876

561
00:26:59,866 --> 00:27:00,876

562
00:27:00,876 --> 00:27:04,216
you actually needed the

563
00:27:04,216 --> 00:27:07,716
of the animation controller to

564

00:27:18,406 --> 00:27:21,936
It's just using the

568
00:27:21,936 --> 00:27:24,016
in UIViewImplicitlyAnimating.

569
00:27:24,146 --> 00:27:25,786
And that's it.

570
00:27:25,786 --> 00:27:28,016
So you could actually have a

571
00:27:28,016 --> 00:27:29,696
that's driven by UIPercentDriven

572
00:27:29,696 --> 00:27:33,746
InteractiveTransition,

573
00:27:34,096 --> 00:27:36,566
OK, let's say you already

574
00:27:36,566 --> 00:27:38,066
you already have a

575
00:27:38,066 --> 00:27:38,876
How do you migrate?

576
00:27:38,876 --> 00:27:42,626
Well, one way to do it would

577
00:27:42,626 --> 00:27:46,006
animateTransition method

578
00:27:46,316 --> 00:27:49,286
and build your interruptible

579
00:27:49,646 --> 00:27:52,866
that you just add that

580
00:27:53,226 --> 00:27:56,276
of the animations

581
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:57,706
Not too difficult.

582
00:27:58,086 --> 00:28:04,826
We did have to extend some other

583
00:27:58,086 --> 00:28:04,826
We did have to extend some other

584
00:28:04,826 --> 00:28:07,096
For example, context

585
00:28:07,096 --> 00:28:08,766
a pauseInteractiveTransition.

586
00:28:09,506 --> 00:28:13,186
That's how you enter into

587
00:28:13,586 --> 00:28:16,116
Prior to this, you

588
00:28:16,116 --> 00:28:18,006
and you ended non-interactive.

589
00:28:18,176 --> 00:28:19,776
Now, you can move

590
00:28:19,776 --> 00:28:21,336
And the way you do that is

591
00:28:21,336 --> 00:28:27,276
by calling pauseInteractive,

592
00:28:27,276 --> 00:28:30,556
Also, the property

593
00:28:30,556 --> 00:28:34,266
and transitionWasCancelled can

594
00:28:34,266 --> 00:28:37,776
and forth between an interactive

595
00:28:38,496 --> 00:28:42,916
We added a variable called

596
00:28:43,106 --> 00:28:44,936
Because now that you

597
00:28:45,526 --> 00:28:47,766
maybe you want your

598
00:28:47,766 --> 00:28:49,646
out non-interactively.

599
00:28:49,956 --> 00:28:52,246
And this variable

600
00:28:54,216 --> 00:28:57,246
Finally, we have UIPercentDriven

601
00:28:57,686 --> 00:29:00,156
InteractiveTransition updated.

602
00:28:57,686 --> 00:29:00,156
InteractiveTransition updated.

603
00:29:01,366 --> 00:29:02,396
There are a few rules.

604
00:29:02,396 --> 00:29:05,086
interruptibleAnimator

605
00:29:05,276 --> 00:29:07,776
we expect it to actually

606
00:29:08,136 --> 00:29:09,796
Meaning don't do something else.

607
00:29:09,796 --> 00:29:11,076
The system might get grumpy.

608
00:29:11,476 --> 00:29:13,136
We're always going to

609
00:29:13,136 --> 00:29:15,096
and startInteractiveTransition

610
00:29:15,486 --> 00:29:17,506
So that would be a great place

611
00:29:17,506 --> 00:29:20,776
to create your interruptible

612
00:29:20,776 --> 00:29:23,416
to be calling it subsequently

613
00:29:23,416 --> 00:29:26,666
and we expect the same

614
00:29:26,946 --> 00:29:28,166
to always be returned.

615
00:29:28,776 --> 00:29:32,266
Finally, the animator survives

616
00:29:32,536 --> 00:29:33,936
It shouldn't become inactive

617
00:29:34,036 --> 00:29:36,456
until the entire

618
00:29:37,306 --> 00:29:38,936
Now, Mike is going to

619
00:29:38,936 --> 00:29:41,696
to use these APIs in a real app.

620
00:29:42,836 --> 00:29:43,936
I didn't give you much time.

621
00:29:44,516 --> 00:29:50,066
[ Applause ]

622
00:29:50,566 --> 00:29:52,286
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Bruce.

623
00:29:52,946 --> 00:29:53,526
All right.

624
00:29:54,356 --> 00:29:57,376
So, let's start with a

625
00:29:57,816 --> 00:29:59,776
We've got an application

626
00:29:59,776 --> 00:30:02,846
that utilizes the

627
00:29:59,776 --> 00:30:02,846
that utilizes the

628
00:30:02,846 --> 00:30:05,576
and the additions to

629
00:30:06,276 --> 00:30:09,346
to create a nice

630
00:30:09,496 --> 00:30:10,136
in a basic app.

631
00:30:10,546 --> 00:30:12,266
So, first, we have

632
00:30:12,346 --> 00:30:13,896
that uses a

633
00:30:13,896 --> 00:30:15,966
and has a Collection View

634
00:30:15,966 --> 00:30:17,946
And we have this grid of

635
00:30:18,606 --> 00:30:19,896
When we tap one of the photos,

636
00:30:19,896 --> 00:30:22,166
it will push another view

637
00:30:22,746 --> 00:30:25,166
And that kind of

638
00:30:25,166 --> 00:30:25,846
of your photos here.

639
00:30:25,846 --> 00:30:28,586
And if we hit the Back button,

640
00:30:29,056 --> 00:30:31,966
And alternatively, we can slide

641
00:30:32,416 --> 00:30:34,276
to do an interactive

642
00:30:34,276 --> 00:30:36,476
And this is all available

643
00:30:36,476 --> 00:30:37,696
in UINavigationController.

644
00:30:38,036 --> 00:30:41,526
And as Bruce just described,

645
00:30:41,526 --> 00:30:43,916
that allow you to

646
00:30:44,076 --> 00:30:46,316
And, here, if we want the

647
00:30:46,316 --> 00:30:49,536
of the page, we can do

648
00:30:49,536 --> 00:30:51,426
When we hit the Back

649
00:30:51,916 --> 00:30:53,316
And this was all

650
00:30:53,496 --> 00:30:55,576
In addition to that,

651
00:30:55,576 --> 00:30:58,916
down to start the transition

652
00:30:59,076 --> 00:31:01,116
and then let it finish

653
00:30:59,076 --> 00:31:01,116
and then let it finish

654
00:31:01,856 --> 00:31:03,556
So I want to show you

655
00:31:03,556 --> 00:31:05,576
that using

656
00:31:13,046 --> 00:31:15,476
OK, so the first thing you need

657
00:31:15,476 --> 00:31:16,906
in this case, the

658
00:31:17,196 --> 00:31:19,916
that you're going to be

659
00:31:20,066 --> 00:31:21,266
So, here, we're going to conform

660
00:31:21,266 --> 00:31:23,496
to the navigation controller's

661
00:31:23,496 --> 00:31:25,586
so with an

662
00:31:25,586 --> 00:31:28,736
And that's just an object we've

663
00:31:28,736 --> 00:31:29,796
transition protocols.

664
00:31:30,576 --> 00:31:32,736
So, here, we have two methods

665
00:31:32,736 --> 00:31:34,966
The first is calling us

666
00:31:35,486 --> 00:31:37,466
with a particular

667
00:31:37,716 --> 00:31:40,186
We'll save that operation

668
00:31:40,186 --> 00:31:41,636
since we're going to be

669
00:31:41,746 --> 00:31:44,636
And then when we return

670
00:31:45,426 --> 00:31:47,406
the system will call us for

671
00:31:47,896 --> 00:31:50,616
at which point we'll also return

672
00:31:50,616 --> 00:31:51,966
to be the interaction

673
00:31:51,966 --> 00:31:54,656
And once we've done that, the

674
00:31:54,656 --> 00:31:55,916
to be an interactive transition.

675
00:31:56,806 --> 00:31:58,996
So let's look at

676
00:31:58,996 --> 00:32:00,046
InteractiveTransitioning.

677
00:31:58,996 --> 00:32:00,046
InteractiveTransitioning.

678
00:32:01,276 --> 00:32:04,116
Here, the system is going to

679
00:32:04,506 --> 00:32:06,826
on our object with a

680
00:32:06,826 --> 00:32:08,436
and that'll have all the

681
00:32:08,436 --> 00:32:11,166
that you'll need to start

682
00:32:12,036 --> 00:32:14,426
And at this point, we're going

683
00:32:14,426 --> 00:32:16,716
that we'll see a little

684
00:32:17,026 --> 00:32:18,236
But that's the object

685
00:32:18,236 --> 00:32:20,536
to create our transition

686
00:32:20,536 --> 00:32:23,456
And we're going to pass the

687
00:32:23,456 --> 00:32:24,126
that we saved

688
00:32:24,546 --> 00:32:26,826
and a panGestureRecognizer

689
00:32:26,826 --> 00:32:28,036
that transition interactively.

690
00:32:28,356 --> 00:32:32,496
In iOS 10, we also allow you to

691
00:32:32,496 --> 00:32:34,466
in two phases -- either

692
00:32:34,506 --> 00:32:35,646
or the interactive phase.

693
00:32:36,006 --> 00:32:38,256
So if we did start from

694
00:32:38,256 --> 00:32:41,026
we're going to set this

695
00:32:41,026 --> 00:32:43,066
to "true" to let the system know

696
00:32:43,066 --> 00:32:44,386
that we're starting

697
00:32:44,386 --> 00:32:45,836
transition interactively.

698
00:32:47,766 --> 00:32:48,826
And next, let's look

699
00:32:48,826 --> 00:32:51,486
at the animated transitioning

700
00:32:51,836 --> 00:32:55,006
Here, we're not really concerned

701
00:32:55,006 --> 00:32:57,676
As Bruce mentioned, we're using

702
00:32:57,676 --> 00:32:59,746
and that's going to call

703
00:32:59,746 --> 00:33:01,216
as opposed to animateTransition.

704
00:32:59,746 --> 00:33:01,216
as opposed to animateTransition.

705
00:33:01,776 --> 00:33:03,906
But the new interruptible

706
00:33:04,076 --> 00:33:06,146
in iOS 10 is what we're

707
00:33:06,856 --> 00:33:08,506
And, here, our helper

708
00:33:08,506 --> 00:33:11,756
in just a second creates

709
00:33:11,756 --> 00:33:13,456
and returns that for

710
00:33:13,916 --> 00:33:15,806
So, that's where

711
00:33:15,806 --> 00:33:17,456
to add any alongside animations.

712
00:33:17,456 --> 00:33:20,966
And in this demo, you'll see the

713
00:33:20,966 --> 00:33:22,556
of animating along

714
00:33:22,556 --> 00:33:24,486
The system is going to take

715
00:33:24,846 --> 00:33:26,036
to add those animations.

716
00:33:26,036 --> 00:33:29,226
So let's look at the

717
00:33:29,226 --> 00:33:29,646
really quick.

718
00:33:30,826 --> 00:33:31,806
All right.

719
00:33:31,806 --> 00:33:34,066
Here, you saw that we

720
00:33:34,066 --> 00:33:35,386
in startInteractiveTransition.

721
00:33:36,326 --> 00:33:40,036
And that's going to call

722
00:33:40,456 --> 00:33:40,936
There we go.

723
00:33:41,456 --> 00:33:44,096
That's going to call

724
00:33:44,096 --> 00:33:46,006
with some animations, and

725
00:33:46,006 --> 00:33:47,996
of the background

726
00:33:48,716 --> 00:33:50,246
You saw visual effect

727
00:33:50,246 --> 00:33:52,406
And the two view controllers,

728
00:33:52,786 --> 00:33:56,186
We'll talk about the image

729
00:33:56,186 --> 00:33:56,606
later on.

730
00:33:57,046 --> 00:34:00,096
And it'll pass in a completion

731
00:33:57,046 --> 00:34:00,096
And it'll pass in a completion

732
00:34:00,096 --> 00:34:01,396
up some of those

733
00:34:01,646 --> 00:34:04,236
But, here, let's focus on how

734
00:34:04,296 --> 00:34:06,236
that we returned to the

735
00:34:07,216 --> 00:34:09,596
So we first get a transition

736
00:34:09,596 --> 00:34:10,936
and we'll look at that

737
00:34:11,496 --> 00:34:13,966
And we're going to create this

738
00:34:14,146 --> 00:34:15,306
and a curve of .easeOut.

739
00:34:15,626 --> 00:34:18,106
And we'll pass in those

740
00:34:18,106 --> 00:34:20,406
And we'll create a

741
00:34:20,406 --> 00:34:23,806
and we'll call those completions

742
00:34:23,806 --> 00:34:25,376
But the important thing

743
00:34:25,376 --> 00:34:27,985
to the transition context

744
00:34:28,446 --> 00:34:29,636
to inform the system that, "Hey,

745
00:34:29,636 --> 00:34:31,096
we're done with this

746
00:34:31,786 --> 00:34:33,436
And we can get where we're --

747
00:34:33,436 --> 00:34:34,206
I'm sorry,

748
00:34:34,206 --> 00:34:36,446
the completionTransition

749
00:34:36,966 --> 00:34:39,966
that we can get the value that

750
00:34:39,966 --> 00:34:41,936
So we pass "yes" to that API.

751
00:34:41,936 --> 00:34:44,025
That means we're going

752
00:34:44,025 --> 00:34:46,335
If we pass "no", it means we're

753
00:34:47,036 --> 00:34:48,755
So before I go a

754
00:34:48,755 --> 00:34:52,505
in the transition animator

755
00:34:52,815 --> 00:34:54,976
I want to show you a few

756
00:34:54,976 --> 00:34:56,976
that are made possible by

757
00:35:02,246 --> 00:35:05,936
So if we go back to the demo,

758
00:35:05,936 --> 00:35:08,866
out of the screen and zoom back

759
00:35:08,866 --> 00:35:11,806
But what I didn't show you is

760
00:35:12,456 --> 00:35:14,896
So we're in the animation

761
00:35:15,036 --> 00:35:16,636
and we move into an

762
00:35:17,046 --> 00:35:18,426
So we're interacting

763
00:35:18,426 --> 00:35:19,336
in the middle of

764
00:35:19,336 --> 00:35:21,476
When we release our finger,

765
00:35:21,476 --> 00:35:22,826
and then we can interrupt

766
00:35:22,826 --> 00:35:25,906
So we're free to move back and

767
00:35:25,996 --> 00:35:28,076
and an interactive

768
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:30,416
So it's really pretty cool.

769
00:35:30,966 --> 00:35:33,376
So before I go back to the

770
00:35:33,376 --> 00:35:34,826
that using the new

771
00:35:34,826 --> 00:35:38,426
I want to describe a particular

772
00:35:38,426 --> 00:35:39,856
understand what the code

773
00:35:40,506 --> 00:35:41,916
So imagine we're starting.

774
00:35:41,916 --> 00:35:44,066
We're pulling down with the

775
00:35:44,066 --> 00:35:45,576
starting an interactive

776
00:35:46,216 --> 00:35:48,186
And then we're going to release

777
00:35:48,236 --> 00:35:50,666
and start an animation phase,

778
00:35:50,736 --> 00:35:53,036
we're going to pause

779
00:35:53,036 --> 00:35:53,876
to interact with it again.

780
00:35:53,876 --> 00:35:55,296
And we're going to

781
00:35:55,296 --> 00:35:56,266
by pulling it back up.

782
00:35:56,956 --> 00:35:58,836
So that's the scenario that

783
00:35:58,836 --> 00:35:59,976
when we look at this

784
00:36:05,096 --> 00:36:07,176
So I've broken that down in

785
00:36:07,266 --> 00:36:08,496
in terms of four methods.

786
00:36:08,496 --> 00:36:12,036
The updateInteraction, which is

787
00:36:12,166 --> 00:36:14,796
that's going to update the

788
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:16,166
And when our finger lifts,

789
00:36:16,456 --> 00:36:18,276
we're going to call the

790
00:36:18,736 --> 00:36:21,086
And then we're going to call

791
00:36:21,086 --> 00:36:22,566
to either the begin

792
00:36:22,976 --> 00:36:25,146
And then when we

793
00:36:25,256 --> 00:36:27,006
we'll end up calling

794
00:36:27,006 --> 00:36:29,976
So we can do this

795
00:36:30,156 --> 00:36:31,546
in the lifetime of a transition.

796
00:36:31,546 --> 00:36:33,446
We can actually do it as

797
00:36:33,496 --> 00:36:35,116
But in this scenario,

798
00:36:35,636 --> 00:36:37,666
So we look at updateInteraction.

799
00:36:38,126 --> 00:36:39,756
This is a gesture

800
00:36:39,976 --> 00:36:43,196
And when it's called in "state

801
00:36:43,196 --> 00:36:44,656
we're going to look

802
00:36:44,656 --> 00:36:46,546
of the gesture recognizer

803
00:36:46,546 --> 00:36:48,986
that to compute a progress

804
00:36:49,136 --> 00:36:51,086
to the transition animator

805
00:36:52,036 --> 00:36:54,746
And then to scrub those

806
00:36:54,746 --> 00:36:57,286
you saw the navbar in some of

807
00:36:57,286 --> 00:36:58,726
in the background

808
00:36:58,726 --> 00:37:01,016
as setting the fractionComplete

809
00:36:58,726 --> 00:37:01,016
as setting the fractionComplete

810
00:37:01,016 --> 00:37:04,426
And that'll let us scrub through

811
00:37:04,426 --> 00:37:04,836
for free.

812
00:37:05,396 --> 00:37:07,366
And then we'll call to

813
00:37:07,366 --> 00:37:09,536
to update the interactive

814
00:37:10,046 --> 00:37:11,166
And then, finally, we have

815
00:37:11,166 --> 00:37:12,756
that image that's

816
00:37:13,046 --> 00:37:15,066
When we're in the interactive

817
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:17,166
we're going to handle

818
00:37:17,166 --> 00:37:18,906
So we have a little helper

819
00:37:20,246 --> 00:37:22,366
And finally, we'll

820
00:37:22,366 --> 00:37:23,316
on this gesture recognizer.

821
00:37:23,836 --> 00:37:26,666
So when we're called, when the

822
00:37:26,666 --> 00:37:28,876
we'll get a "state ended"

823
00:37:28,876 --> 00:37:30,166
and we'll call endInteraction.

824
00:37:30,986 --> 00:37:32,346
If we look at endInteraction,

825
00:37:32,996 --> 00:37:35,696
we first just check is our

826
00:37:35,696 --> 00:37:37,816
And we want to make sure

827
00:37:37,816 --> 00:37:38,956
out of the interactive phase.

828
00:37:39,386 --> 00:37:41,066
And we'll call a

829
00:37:41,066 --> 00:37:42,966
that tells us whether

830
00:37:42,996 --> 00:37:45,606
in the begin position of the

831
00:37:46,126 --> 00:37:48,136
If we're completing in the

832
00:37:48,136 --> 00:37:49,536
to call to the context

833
00:37:49,536 --> 00:37:51,496
we're finishing the

834
00:37:51,856 --> 00:37:53,296
We're going to move to

835
00:37:53,296 --> 00:37:55,776
If we're called with

836
00:37:55,776 --> 00:37:57,766
we're going to say we're

837
00:37:57,766 --> 00:37:59,356
and we're going to move

838
00:37:59,646 --> 00:38:00,566
And then we just animate.

839
00:37:59,646 --> 00:38:00,566
And then we just animate.

840
00:38:00,676 --> 00:38:02,526
So let's look at the

841
00:38:04,476 --> 00:38:05,966
So, previously, I told you

842
00:38:05,966 --> 00:38:07,766
that the transition

843
00:38:07,766 --> 00:38:10,806
of the background chrome

844
00:38:11,366 --> 00:38:13,536
But, here, we're going to create

845
00:38:13,536 --> 00:38:15,746
And we're going to use

846
00:38:15,746 --> 00:38:17,326
of these images that are

847
00:38:17,446 --> 00:38:20,366
And the reason we do that is

848
00:38:20,366 --> 00:38:21,846
to have a different

849
00:38:22,166 --> 00:38:23,496
than the animations

850
00:38:23,886 --> 00:38:25,536
And we'll see that

851
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:27,466
So, here, we're just going

852
00:38:27,966 --> 00:38:30,266
Now we're going to

853
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:33,046
or basically the target or the

854
00:38:33,396 --> 00:38:34,196
And then we're going to start

855
00:38:34,196 --> 00:38:36,706
that property animator

856
00:38:36,936 --> 00:38:38,996
Now, remember, we have this

857
00:38:38,996 --> 00:38:40,646
living the lifetime

858
00:38:40,646 --> 00:38:42,746
that we gave back to the system.

859
00:38:43,316 --> 00:38:45,076
And we just need to make

860
00:38:45,076 --> 00:38:46,186
in the correct direction.

861
00:38:46,526 --> 00:38:49,246
So if we specified a toPosition

862
00:38:49,246 --> 00:38:50,256
to reverse that animator.

863
00:38:51,406 --> 00:38:54,586
And finally, if this is the

864
00:38:54,586 --> 00:38:57,076
through animate here, our

865
00:38:57,076 --> 00:38:58,526
to be in an inactive state.

866
00:38:58,886 --> 00:39:00,916
So all we need to do is start

867
00:38:58,886 --> 00:39:00,916
So all we need to do is start

868
00:39:00,916 --> 00:39:02,516
and we're off to

869
00:39:03,676 --> 00:39:06,646
Alternatively, if it's been

870
00:39:06,956 --> 00:39:08,156
we're going to use

871
00:39:08,446 --> 00:39:10,366
We're going to call in

872
00:39:11,016 --> 00:39:13,446
(withTimingParameters

873
00:39:13,656 --> 00:39:16,966
So continueAnimation lets you

874
00:39:17,316 --> 00:39:19,846
with different timing parameters

875
00:39:19,846 --> 00:39:21,106
and the remaining

876
00:39:21,616 --> 00:39:23,356
And here, we're going to

877
00:39:23,356 --> 00:39:25,686
like to use the timing

878
00:39:25,976 --> 00:39:27,826
when we initialized this

879
00:39:27,826 --> 00:39:29,786
But we're going to

880
00:39:30,176 --> 00:39:32,196
of the continued animation.

881
00:39:32,196 --> 00:39:34,606
And that will allow us to

882
00:39:34,606 --> 00:39:36,706
of this new itemFrameAnimator

883
00:39:36,706 --> 00:39:38,766
above with the duration

884
00:39:38,766 --> 00:39:39,876
of this transition animator.

885
00:39:40,466 --> 00:39:42,086
So the durationFactor

886
00:39:42,086 --> 00:39:46,326
as 1.0 equals the initial

887
00:39:46,326 --> 00:39:47,826
when you created this

888
00:39:48,316 --> 00:39:50,946
And that's all we have to do to

889
00:39:51,496 --> 00:39:52,726
And lastly for this cycle,

890
00:39:52,726 --> 00:39:54,896
let's look at the

891
00:39:55,026 --> 00:39:58,286
And this is when it's

892
00:39:58,416 --> 00:40:00,006
We put our finger down

893
00:39:58,416 --> 00:40:00,006
We put our finger down

894
00:40:00,326 --> 00:40:01,626
And we just put a

895
00:40:01,626 --> 00:40:03,666
on that image view

896
00:40:04,006 --> 00:40:05,316
And we're free to do that now

897
00:40:05,316 --> 00:40:08,146
because UIViewPropertyAnimator

898
00:40:08,146 --> 00:40:08,996
view automatically.

899
00:40:10,146 --> 00:40:12,606
So on that itemFrameAnimator

900
00:40:12,636 --> 00:40:15,396
we're going to stop that

901
00:40:15,396 --> 00:40:19,316
of "true", indicating to the

902
00:40:19,316 --> 00:40:20,676
on continuing this animation,

903
00:40:20,676 --> 00:40:22,836
that we'd like the model

904
00:40:24,236 --> 00:40:26,416
excuse me, the presentation

905
00:40:26,416 --> 00:40:26,876
to the model.

906
00:40:26,906 --> 00:40:29,606
And then on the transition

907
00:40:29,606 --> 00:40:30,996
to call to pauseAnimation.

908
00:40:31,306 --> 00:40:33,056
Because as we saw in

909
00:40:33,056 --> 00:40:34,576
we were scrubbing that animation

910
00:40:34,576 --> 00:40:36,046
when we were interacting

911
00:40:36,266 --> 00:40:37,516
And then, finally,

912
00:40:37,516 --> 00:40:39,286
to the transition

913
00:40:39,286 --> 00:40:43,516
out of the animation phase

914
00:40:44,396 --> 00:40:46,876
And so I'd like to show

915
00:40:47,306 --> 00:40:49,286
kind of a little

916
00:40:49,536 --> 00:40:54,706
We saw that this timing is

917
00:40:54,706 --> 00:40:56,146
that for illustration purposes.

918
00:40:56,546 --> 00:40:59,576
But you might want to make

919
00:40:59,576 --> 00:41:01,156
and a little bit more lively.

920
00:40:59,576 --> 00:41:01,156
and a little bit more lively.

921
00:41:01,886 --> 00:41:04,686
So if we look at changing

922
00:41:04,876 --> 00:41:06,376
it kind of jumps out of the page

923
00:41:06,776 --> 00:41:09,666
and only the image is

924
00:41:09,666 --> 00:41:11,616
And here, those background

925
00:41:11,616 --> 00:41:13,926
to operate on that .easeOut

926
00:41:14,656 --> 00:41:16,646
So we were able to

927
00:41:16,646 --> 00:41:19,426
and make this feel much more

928
00:41:19,426 --> 00:41:21,496
of code, and we can still

929
00:41:21,646 --> 00:41:25,526
So let's take a look at that

930
00:41:27,586 --> 00:41:29,086
So we come back to

931
00:41:29,086 --> 00:41:31,586
at our propertyAnimator

932
00:41:32,046 --> 00:41:34,606
We'll notice that we're

933
00:41:34,606 --> 00:41:36,426
with timing parameters

934
00:41:36,906 --> 00:41:39,126
And that's what gives us

935
00:41:39,126 --> 00:41:41,456
And a colleague of mine

936
00:41:41,456 --> 00:41:44,226
in here specifying some

937
00:41:44,226 --> 00:41:47,366
to use instead with a

938
00:41:47,396 --> 00:41:48,536
damping, initial velocity.

939
00:41:48,536 --> 00:41:50,676
And that fully specifies

940
00:41:51,416 --> 00:41:53,626
So when we create the

941
00:41:53,776 --> 00:41:56,476
this duration that we're

942
00:41:56,836 --> 00:41:58,776
Rather, it'll be computed based

943
00:41:58,776 --> 00:42:00,836
on the properties we've

944
00:41:58,776 --> 00:42:00,836
on the properties we've

945
00:42:01,436 --> 00:42:04,476
And because of that, we have

946
00:42:04,476 --> 00:42:07,896
function here that just uses

947
00:42:07,896 --> 00:42:11,676
that we just saw down below here

948
00:42:11,676 --> 00:42:13,986
So it basically solves that

949
00:42:13,986 --> 00:42:16,336
And we can use that to

950
00:42:16,336 --> 00:42:17,376
of the transition animator.

951
00:42:18,286 --> 00:42:20,056
That's all super simple.

952
00:42:20,056 --> 00:42:23,386
I know this code is looking

953
00:42:23,386 --> 00:42:25,096
but it's really only a

954
00:42:25,406 --> 00:42:27,676
And UIViewPropertyAnimator

955
00:42:28,526 --> 00:42:30,976
So, with that, I'd like to

&gt;&gt; Thanks, Mike.

958
00:42:39,186 --> 00:42:41,726
OK, I've got to speed things

959
00:42:41,726 --> 00:42:43,276
up because we're a

960
00:42:43,826 --> 00:42:47,036
We need to talk a little

961
00:42:47,126 --> 00:42:52,846
We're going to assume that

962
00:42:53,266 --> 00:42:55,556
so that we can actually

963
00:42:55,556 --> 00:42:58,216
If it was "false", we would

964
00:42:58,836 --> 00:43:01,876
We have this property called

965
00:42:58,836 --> 00:43:01,876
We have this property called

966
00:43:01,876 --> 00:43:03,216
that defaults to "false".

967
00:43:03,726 --> 00:43:06,646
And the reason it defaults

968
00:43:06,646 --> 00:43:08,916
to be able to hit

969
00:43:09,256 --> 00:43:12,286
If it were "true", which is the

970
00:43:12,546 --> 00:43:15,656
when you try to touch down

971
00:43:15,656 --> 00:43:17,376
that you saw, we

972
00:43:17,376 --> 00:43:21,786
And perhaps, puzzlingly, it

973
00:43:22,136 --> 00:43:23,436
We don't want that to happen

974
00:43:23,596 --> 00:43:25,826
for an interruptible

975
00:43:26,196 --> 00:43:29,136
Now in this talk below, which

976
00:43:29,586 --> 00:43:32,886
a technique was given whereby

977
00:43:32,886 --> 00:43:35,806
do some calculation to convert

978
00:43:35,806 --> 00:43:39,296
and call "super" so that you

979
00:43:40,306 --> 00:43:41,886
That technique still works.

980
00:43:41,886 --> 00:43:45,376
But now with propertyAnimators

981
00:43:45,376 --> 00:43:48,166
by default, with manual hit

982
00:43:48,166 --> 00:43:50,886
we're actually going to

983
00:43:51,576 --> 00:43:53,746
So that's pretty cool, and

984
00:43:53,746 --> 00:43:57,036
In fact, that's how everything

985
00:43:57,036 --> 00:43:58,236
so far has been working.

986
00:43:58,896 --> 00:44:00,436
Now this doesn't

987
00:43:58,896 --> 00:44:00,436
Now this doesn't

988
00:44:00,436 --> 00:44:02,586
If you have deep view

989
00:44:02,586 --> 00:44:04,316
we are not going to

990
00:44:04,676 --> 00:44:07,786
So you may need to use

991
00:44:07,786 --> 00:44:08,936
about in the other talk.

992
00:44:10,266 --> 00:44:12,766
OK. We have this whole

993
00:44:12,766 --> 00:44:16,606
for keyframe animations

994
00:44:16,866 --> 00:44:18,356
How do you make those

995
00:44:18,916 --> 00:44:21,606
To recall, a keyframe

996
00:44:21,606 --> 00:44:24,626
of like a regular animation

997
00:44:24,696 --> 00:44:27,216
that you want to animate from.

998
00:44:29,336 --> 00:44:31,466
We want to make those

999
00:44:32,566 --> 00:44:34,846
In fact, we want to do

1000
00:44:34,846 --> 00:44:36,396
on this video right now.

1001
00:44:36,396 --> 00:44:37,856
We want to pause it, scrub it.

1002
00:44:38,356 --> 00:44:40,536
And I guess it's

1003
00:44:40,536 --> 00:44:41,996
In fact, you can do it.

1004
00:44:42,256 --> 00:44:43,446
It's really easy to do.

1005
00:44:43,446 --> 00:44:47,346
You take the existing API

1006
00:44:47,536 --> 00:44:50,186
to an animator's animations.

1007
00:44:50,546 --> 00:44:53,116
And with that, you have

1008
00:44:53,116 --> 00:44:53,976
animations, too.

PopGestureRecognizers.

1015
00:45:03,486 --> 00:45:05,896
That's the built-in

1016
00:45:06,406 --> 00:45:08,876
Currently, if you have an

1017
00:45:09,506 --> 00:45:10,776
you can't use that.

1018
00:45:11,526 --> 00:45:15,006
But new in iOS 10, if you

1019
00:45:15,126 --> 00:45:17,946
on that gesture recognizer

1020
00:45:18,376 --> 00:45:22,376
we will allow the built-in pop

1021
00:45:22,376 --> 00:45:27,126
and use the built-in navigation

1022
00:45:27,126 --> 00:45:27,976

1025
00:45:33,926 --> 00:45:35,606
to create interruptible

with a UIViewPropertyAnimator.

about other types of animations,
