00:00:20,196 --> 00:00:20,856
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

3
00:00:21,356 --> 00:00:23,756
Welcome everyone to Go

4
00:00:24,326 --> 00:00:25,926
In this session, we

5
00:00:25,926 --> 00:00:28,226
about all the new features that

6
00:00:29,006 --> 00:00:30,956
I am Ben Harry, a

7
00:00:30,956 --> 00:00:32,786
on the Game Technologies

8
00:00:33,326 --> 00:00:35,506
And later, you'll be

9
00:00:36,556 --> 00:00:39,776
Now we know people love

10
00:00:40,086 --> 00:00:42,036
and share those recordings

11
00:00:43,196 --> 00:00:45,256
ReplayKit gives our

12
00:00:45,476 --> 00:00:47,876
with little effort required

13
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:52,316
To get started today, I am going

14
00:00:52,316 --> 00:00:54,746
about the existing features

15
00:00:57,696 --> 00:00:59,116
ReplayKit provides the ability

16
00:00:59,116 --> 00:01:01,166
to record your app's

17
00:00:59,116 --> 00:01:01,166
to record your app's

18
00:01:01,836 --> 00:01:04,406
In addition, you may

19
00:01:05,036 --> 00:01:07,846
By doing so, your users can

20
00:01:07,846 --> 00:01:08,416
playing their games.

21
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:10,906
After a user trays a recording,

22
00:01:11,366 --> 00:01:12,946
they may share the

23
00:01:12,946 --> 00:01:15,006
from their game using

24
00:01:16,646 --> 00:01:19,576
ReplayKit has a simple API, and

25
00:01:19,986 --> 00:01:21,726
a small amount of

26
00:01:21,726 --> 00:01:23,436
to bring these features

27
00:01:24,046 --> 00:01:28,686
Moving along, ReplayKit will

28
00:01:29,036 --> 00:01:31,196
with little impact on

29
00:01:31,316 --> 00:01:34,446
and uses a minimal amount of

30
00:01:35,886 --> 00:01:39,556
Here at Apple, user privacy

31
00:01:40,216 --> 00:01:42,356
so we have implemented

32
00:01:42,736 --> 00:01:46,386
For example, we present a user

33
00:01:46,936 --> 00:01:50,036
so user's can give permission

34
00:01:50,856 --> 00:01:53,756
Furthermore, recording

35
00:01:53,756 --> 00:01:55,176
including notifications.

36
00:01:55,786 --> 00:01:58,306
Therefore, when you receive

37
00:01:58,306 --> 00:02:01,066
playing a game, that message

38
00:01:58,306 --> 00:02:01,066
playing a game, that message

39
00:02:03,186 --> 00:02:06,476
Finally, ReplayKit was

40
00:02:07,196 --> 00:02:08,806
So this is a list of

41
00:02:08,806 --> 00:02:10,126
that we offer with ReplayKit.

42
00:02:10,866 --> 00:02:14,426
Now, I am going to take a

43
00:02:14,426 --> 00:02:15,926
that have been added

44
00:02:17,376 --> 00:02:20,506
First up, we are bringing

45
00:02:21,296 --> 00:02:23,976
So now, you'll be able

46
00:02:23,976 --> 00:02:26,236
and share it directly

47
00:02:27,076 --> 00:02:29,716
The next new feature we've

48
00:02:30,206 --> 00:02:33,496
Now, users will be able

49
00:02:33,566 --> 00:02:36,326
in real-time to third

50
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:40,686
And for our third and final

51
00:02:40,876 --> 00:02:42,406
to record the Face Time camera.

52
00:02:43,256 --> 00:02:45,086
In addition, we've

53
00:02:45,296 --> 00:02:47,076
to the microphone recording API.

54
00:02:49,596 --> 00:02:51,716
So before I get into

55
00:02:51,826 --> 00:02:53,486
I'm going to take a minute

56
00:02:53,486 --> 00:02:54,696
of the ReplayKit architecture.

57
00:02:55,426 --> 00:02:58,566
I want to show you how your app

58
00:02:58,566 --> 00:03:00,826
with the operating system

59
00:02:58,566 --> 00:03:00,826
with the operating system

60
00:03:01,786 --> 00:03:05,126
So here we have your

61
00:03:05,566 --> 00:03:07,856
Your application needs to

62
00:03:07,856 --> 00:03:09,186
when it wants to

63
00:03:10,306 --> 00:03:12,856
So ReplayKit provides an

64
00:03:13,556 --> 00:03:15,346
You will tell this class

65
00:03:16,326 --> 00:03:19,056
At this moment, a message is

66
00:03:19,436 --> 00:03:22,056
The Replay Daemon will start

67
00:03:22,686 --> 00:03:24,026
to a movie file.

68
00:03:25,936 --> 00:03:27,526
When you tell the

69
00:03:27,526 --> 00:03:31,046
to stop recording, the Replay

70
00:03:31,046 --> 00:03:34,096
movie, and now we have

71
00:03:34,236 --> 00:03:37,056
Now this movie needs to get

72
00:03:37,056 --> 00:03:41,466
so your users can preview

73
00:03:42,036 --> 00:03:46,226
To do so, we provide the

74
00:03:46,936 --> 00:03:48,956
You present this view

75
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:51,056
so now your users

76
00:03:51,056 --> 00:03:52,616
where they can preview,

77
00:03:52,616 --> 00:03:54,906
and they can share the

78
00:03:55,886 --> 00:04:00,476
As we just saw, we have

79
00:03:55,886 --> 00:04:00,476
As we just saw, we have

80
00:04:01,086 --> 00:04:02,816
This is the class you

81
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:04,766
stop and to discard recordings.

82
00:04:05,316 --> 00:04:07,386
You will also use it to

83
00:04:07,386 --> 00:04:08,636
to record on the device.

84
00:04:09,646 --> 00:04:11,966
There is a delegate property

85
00:04:12,086 --> 00:04:15,776
and it will notify you if the

86
00:04:16,516 --> 00:04:19,916
Also it will let you know of

87
00:04:20,846 --> 00:04:24,626
The second class I brought up

88
00:04:24,996 --> 00:04:26,826
You present this view

89
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:32,556
to give your users ability to

90
00:04:32,556 --> 00:04:35,516
and to share that recording

91
00:04:36,646 --> 00:04:38,676
We also have a delegate

92
00:04:38,726 --> 00:04:41,156
and this delegate will let you

93
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:42,696
with the preview user interface.

94
00:04:43,546 --> 00:04:46,346
So this is the reflected

95
00:04:46,346 --> 00:04:49,076
and the classes you will use

96
00:04:49,076 --> 00:04:52,516
on both iOS and tvOS,

97
00:04:52,516 --> 00:04:53,856
to ReplayKit and Apple TV.

98
00:04:54,526 --> 00:04:57,966
And to begin I'm going

99
00:05:06,116 --> 00:05:08,016
So here I have a

100
00:05:08,256 --> 00:05:11,186
Fox was developed

101
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:12,406
It was developed using SceneKit.

102
00:05:13,386 --> 00:05:15,506
You may also recognize it

103
00:05:15,506 --> 00:05:17,196
as sample code on our

104
00:05:18,216 --> 00:05:19,916
The goal of this game

105
00:05:20,006 --> 00:05:21,826
and collect these flowers

106
00:05:21,826 --> 00:05:23,996
I'm going to make my

107
00:05:23,996 --> 00:05:25,556
and collect the flowers.

108
00:05:25,556 --> 00:05:27,556
There's three on the

109
00:05:28,196 --> 00:05:30,206
You can optionally collect

110
00:05:30,206 --> 00:05:32,446
but I'm just going to

111
00:05:32,446 --> 00:05:32,976
I got two.

112
00:05:33,856 --> 00:05:36,646
I know the third flower is on

113
00:05:36,856 --> 00:05:37,746
on the topo of the rock.

114
00:05:37,866 --> 00:05:43,066
So I'm over here, so

115
00:05:43,066 --> 00:05:44,836
I'm going to bring

116
00:05:45,966 --> 00:05:47,056
because I want to record this.

117
00:05:47,056 --> 00:05:48,486
There is an obstacle

118
00:05:48,776 --> 00:05:50,626
and I've been practicing

119
00:05:51,326 --> 00:05:53,396
so I wanted to share this

120
00:05:53,476 --> 00:05:56,206
that I can get through

121
00:05:56,206 --> 00:05:58,476
So I'm going to start

122
00:05:58,986 --> 00:06:01,076
and here is the consent

123
00:05:58,986 --> 00:06:01,076
and here is the consent

124
00:06:01,616 --> 00:06:02,906
And I am going to

125
00:06:04,626 --> 00:06:05,446
So now I'm recording.

126
00:06:06,856 --> 00:06:08,136
So notice the recording

127
00:06:08,136 --> 00:06:09,186
at the top of the screen.

128
00:06:10,836 --> 00:06:12,916
This lets me know that our

129
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:14,176
Okay, so I made it

130
00:06:14,756 --> 00:06:16,946
So all I have to do now

131
00:06:17,266 --> 00:06:20,576
to do the final flower,

132
00:06:21,146 --> 00:06:22,876
and ultimately finish

133
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:27,456
Okay so that's it.

134
00:06:28,296 --> 00:06:29,456
I'm going to stop my recording.

135
00:06:30,436 --> 00:06:32,906
Now, once I'm stopped, I have

136
00:06:32,906 --> 00:06:34,686
or share the video I

137
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:35,656
to start off by previewing.

138
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,196
So we have a video playback,

139
00:06:38,196 --> 00:06:40,546
and we have a timeline we can

140
00:06:41,386 --> 00:06:42,726
I'm just going to

141
00:06:44,906 --> 00:06:47,146
Notice here that recording

142
00:06:47,146 --> 00:06:47,746
in the recording.

143
00:06:47,746 --> 00:06:49,636
I'm going to show you

144
00:06:49,636 --> 00:06:50,396
in just a few minutes.

145
00:06:51,556 --> 00:06:54,196
So I have a video, I'm happy

146
00:06:54,786 --> 00:06:55,666
So now I want to share it.

147
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:58,026
So I'm going to go over

148
00:07:00,136 --> 00:07:02,066
And now we are presented

149
00:07:03,036 --> 00:07:04,056
So I'm going to grab my phone.

150
00:07:08,536 --> 00:07:09,846
I'm going to select my phone.

151
00:07:15,216 --> 00:07:19,186
Anyway, when I do accept

152
00:07:19,506 --> 00:07:21,886
and the file is transferred,

153
00:07:21,886 --> 00:07:24,676
I do have the ability where

154
00:07:24,676 --> 00:07:27,606
I can edit and trim the

155
00:07:27,606 --> 00:07:29,976
and finally I can share it to

156
00:07:36,326 --> 00:07:38,556
So that was how ReplayKit

157
00:07:39,886 --> 00:07:43,016
I now want to take a few moments

158
00:07:43,016 --> 00:07:46,306
from the demo, and then I'm

159
00:07:46,306 --> 00:07:48,766
that corresponds with each

160
00:07:49,326 --> 00:07:50,276
So first I'm going to begin.

161
00:07:50,276 --> 00:07:51,506
I'm going to have

162
00:07:51,506 --> 00:07:52,596
where I started my recording.

163
00:07:53,186 --> 00:07:56,766
Then we have the gameplay where

164
00:07:56,766 --> 00:08:01,316
on screen, back to the game

165
00:07:56,766 --> 00:08:01,316
on screen, back to the game

166
00:08:02,556 --> 00:08:04,646
and finally when I stop the

167
00:08:04,646 --> 00:08:07,136
to preview or share

168
00:08:08,206 --> 00:08:10,026
So I'm going to walk

169
00:08:10,026 --> 00:08:11,946
and show you the code that

170
00:08:12,606 --> 00:08:13,876
We began or start our recording.

171
00:08:14,896 --> 00:08:16,996
So when I press my

172
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:18,916
first I'm going to grab

173
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:20,086
of the RPScreeningRecorder.

174
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:23,386
And I simply am going to

175
00:08:24,066 --> 00:08:24,946
Now once I'm recording,

176
00:08:25,026 --> 00:08:26,666
I'm going to present

177
00:08:27,476 --> 00:08:31,256
As I mentioned in the video,

178
00:08:31,256 --> 00:08:33,385
the indicator was not

179
00:08:33,775 --> 00:08:36,706
This is because ReplayKit will

180
00:08:36,706 --> 00:08:37,405
main window.

181
00:08:37,785 --> 00:08:40,756
Therefore, I'm going to

182
00:08:41,466 --> 00:08:43,346
And then the indicator view.

183
00:08:43,346 --> 00:08:45,876
The indicator view will be

184
00:08:45,876 --> 00:08:48,896
This is because now you can make

185
00:08:49,356 --> 00:08:50,376
So we have an indicator view,

186
00:08:50,376 --> 00:08:52,886
I'm going to instantiate an

187
00:08:53,186 --> 00:08:56,116
and simply add it as a sub view

188
00:08:56,116 --> 00:08:58,106
to the window I created above.

189
00:08:58,626 --> 00:09:00,276
Now the indicator

190
00:08:58,626 --> 00:09:00,276
Now the indicator

191
00:09:01,186 --> 00:09:02,166
and we know we're recording.

192
00:09:02,356 --> 00:09:06,886
When we are done recording, we

193
00:09:07,316 --> 00:09:09,166
Again, I'm going to

194
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:10,346
of the RPScreenRecorder.

195
00:09:11,616 --> 00:09:14,166
Now notice we return the

196
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:17,216
which is the RPPreviewController

197
00:09:17,906 --> 00:09:20,116
I'm going to hide

198
00:09:20,336 --> 00:09:23,156
And here it's important that

199
00:09:23,156 --> 00:09:26,196
of the preview view controller,

200
00:09:26,196 --> 00:09:28,736
to present in the next

201
00:09:28,736 --> 00:09:29,846
and sharing the video.

202
00:09:30,976 --> 00:09:34,996
Finally I'm going

203
00:09:34,996 --> 00:09:37,046
So we saw that we have

204
00:09:37,046 --> 00:09:38,116
but we have two interfaces,

205
00:09:38,116 --> 00:09:39,756
one for previewing,

206
00:09:40,866 --> 00:09:43,626
So at Apple TV, we have

207
00:09:44,426 --> 00:09:47,586
When we want a preview, we

208
00:09:47,586 --> 00:09:51,136
and then present

209
00:09:51,206 --> 00:09:54,486
Similarly, to share, we

210
00:09:54,486 --> 00:09:58,306
We are going to set the

211
00:09:58,306 --> 00:09:59,266
present the view controller.

212
00:09:59,976 --> 00:10:02,116
Now we will be presented

213
00:09:59,976 --> 00:10:02,116
Now we will be presented

214
00:10:03,956 --> 00:10:07,546
In both cases, when the user

215
00:10:07,696 --> 00:10:09,526
we have a delegate method

216
00:10:10,086 --> 00:10:11,536
Preview Controller did finish.

217
00:10:12,736 --> 00:10:14,596
It's important when this

218
00:10:15,086 --> 00:10:16,866
that you dismiss the

219
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:19,906
since your app was

220
00:10:20,526 --> 00:10:24,166
Finally, when we are done

221
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:26,706
that we no longer need

222
00:10:26,756 --> 00:10:27,866
to discard that recording.

223
00:10:28,456 --> 00:10:31,606
Now ReplayKit will automatically

224
00:10:31,606 --> 00:10:32,906
when a new recording begins.

225
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:36,146
This is because one recording

226
00:10:37,406 --> 00:10:39,416
You could also explicitly

227
00:10:39,706 --> 00:10:41,806
when you know that the preview

228
00:10:42,326 --> 00:10:43,926
For example, maybe at

229
00:10:43,926 --> 00:10:45,946
there could be no

230
00:10:45,946 --> 00:10:46,796
to present a preview.

231
00:10:47,296 --> 00:10:49,146
So now you can explicitly

232
00:10:49,146 --> 00:10:52,056
by calling RPScreenRecorder's

233
00:10:54,266 --> 00:10:57,076
Through these last few slides,

234
00:10:57,076 --> 00:10:58,146
of code that is required

235
00:10:58,196 --> 00:11:00,956
to bring these features

236
00:10:58,196 --> 00:11:00,956
to bring these features

237
00:11:01,896 --> 00:11:04,626
I encourage you all to add

238
00:11:05,016 --> 00:11:07,546
and also to your iOS apps, if

239
00:11:08,206 --> 00:11:11,766
So now, let me take a minute

240
00:11:11,766 --> 00:11:13,396
to summarize ReplayKit

241
00:11:14,426 --> 00:11:15,876
Now, with ReplayKit

242
00:11:15,876 --> 00:11:18,626
you can record your app

243
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:23,366
Under Apple TV, the microphone

244
00:11:23,896 --> 00:11:27,126
so you cannot provide voice

245
00:11:27,816 --> 00:11:30,286
But you can allow users

246
00:11:30,286 --> 00:11:32,586
and they can share their videos

247
00:11:34,236 --> 00:11:36,866
As you saw, we have

248
00:11:37,186 --> 00:11:40,006
In fact, it's the same

249
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:43,106
All these features

250
00:11:43,106 --> 00:11:45,336
to be available new in tvOS 10.

251
00:11:46,366 --> 00:11:48,626
So that was ReplayKit

252
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:52,216
So now it's time to move on to

253
00:11:52,216 --> 00:11:54,426
which I personally am

254
00:11:55,066 --> 00:11:57,966
So, at this time, please welcome

255
00:11:58,516 --> 00:12:02,616
[ Applause ]

256
00:11:58,516 --> 00:12:02,616
[ Applause ]

257
00:12:03,116 --> 00:12:04,716
&gt;&gt; Alright, thanks guys.

258
00:12:04,966 --> 00:12:06,616
Hey, how is everyone doing?

259
00:12:06,616 --> 00:12:07,786
My name is Edwin Iskandar.

260
00:12:07,846 --> 00:12:08,896
I am a Software Engineer

261
00:12:09,016 --> 00:12:10,816
on the Game Technologies

262
00:12:11,406 --> 00:12:14,156
And like Ben, I'm super

263
00:12:14,156 --> 00:12:16,676
about our next feature,

264
00:12:17,086 --> 00:12:20,656
So with Live Broadcast,

265
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:23,446
to broadcast gameplay to

266
00:12:23,736 --> 00:12:26,556
directly from their

267
00:12:27,426 --> 00:12:29,726
So this is really exciting,

268
00:12:29,726 --> 00:12:32,496
that this will be possible

269
00:12:32,956 --> 00:12:36,636
or third party SDKs, will

270
00:12:36,636 --> 00:12:38,926
to take advantage of their

271
00:12:38,926 --> 00:12:42,256
camera and microphone to

272
00:12:42,256 --> 00:12:42,876
in real-time.

273
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:46,436
And finally, we are going to

274
00:12:46,436 --> 00:12:49,676
that all audio and video data

275
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:51,296
and the broadcast service.

276
00:12:51,736 --> 00:12:55,026
Alright, so to illustrate how

277
00:12:55,026 --> 00:12:57,646
with flair games to implement

278
00:12:57,676 --> 00:12:59,756
and the flagship

279
00:13:00,226 --> 00:13:01,436
So it's a really awesome game.

280
00:13:01,436 --> 00:13:03,246
It's available in

281
00:13:03,346 --> 00:13:05,426
And it has this unique

282
00:13:05,656 --> 00:13:07,016
RPG and action elements.

283
00:13:07,956 --> 00:13:10,406
Okay, now that we have a

284
00:13:10,726 --> 00:13:12,496
we also need somewhere

285
00:13:13,856 --> 00:13:17,086
So we've also been working with

286
00:13:17,086 --> 00:13:18,686
that specializes

287
00:13:19,896 --> 00:13:21,206
Alright, so now that

288
00:13:21,296 --> 00:13:22,956
and a service, we're

289
00:13:23,276 --> 00:13:24,246
So let's see this in action.

290
00:13:25,736 --> 00:13:27,216
Alright so in Olympus Rising,

291
00:13:27,216 --> 00:13:29,696
the Flair developers have

292
00:13:29,696 --> 00:13:30,866
to start broadcasting.

293
00:13:31,086 --> 00:13:33,786
To initiate a broadcast,

294
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:36,636
and are pesented with

295
00:13:36,636 --> 00:13:38,486
that they have pre-installed

296
00:13:38,946 --> 00:13:40,176
In this particular example,

297
00:13:40,176 --> 00:13:41,816
the user has installed

298
00:13:42,296 --> 00:13:43,306
so it appears on this list.

299
00:13:43,346 --> 00:13:47,516
So at this point, the user

300
00:13:47,936 --> 00:13:49,506
and they are presented

301
00:13:49,506 --> 00:13:50,786
to set up the broadcast.

302
00:13:52,096 --> 00:13:55,146
The user then goes ahead and

303
00:13:56,146 --> 00:13:57,916
and once they're done,

304
00:13:57,916 --> 00:14:01,646
on the start broadcast button,

305
00:13:57,916 --> 00:14:01,646
on the start broadcast button,

306
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:03,226
which then presents a countdown,

307
00:14:03,596 --> 00:14:06,396
so that the player can get

308
00:14:06,866 --> 00:14:10,746
And now that they're live,

309
00:14:10,746 --> 00:14:13,426
video and audio data is streamed

310
00:14:13,796 --> 00:14:16,456
Spectators all around the world

311
00:14:16,656 --> 00:14:19,836
from their device, and watch

312
00:14:20,566 --> 00:14:21,576
Within the Mob Crush app,

313
00:14:21,576 --> 00:14:24,116
spectators can also discuss

314
00:14:24,436 --> 00:14:27,806
And even cooler, broadcasters

315
00:14:28,146 --> 00:14:29,696
when this happens while

316
00:14:30,846 --> 00:14:32,026
So it's just like in sports,

317
00:14:32,116 --> 00:14:33,386
there is something

318
00:14:33,386 --> 00:14:34,956
about watching an event live.

319
00:14:35,786 --> 00:14:38,176
Now, this will be

320
00:14:38,476 --> 00:14:39,976
and tvOS games as well.

321
00:14:44,056 --> 00:14:45,746
Alright so now that we've

322
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:48,266
as a game developer, you're

323
00:14:48,266 --> 00:14:49,736
to implement this

324
00:14:49,936 --> 00:14:52,636
Here is the player

325
00:14:53,186 --> 00:14:55,026
As you can see, there

326
00:14:55,376 --> 00:14:58,786
Initiating the broadcast,

327
00:14:59,386 --> 00:15:03,146
setting up the broadcast,

328
00:14:59,386 --> 00:15:03,146
setting up the broadcast,

329
00:15:03,146 --> 00:15:06,016
and stopping the broadcast,

330
00:15:06,016 --> 00:15:08,966
in progress, and also uploading

331
00:15:08,966 --> 00:15:10,016
to the back-end servers.

332
00:15:10,766 --> 00:15:12,586
So this might look a little

333
00:15:12,886 --> 00:15:15,246
but the good news for

334
00:15:15,246 --> 00:15:16,856
of these steps are

335
00:15:17,126 --> 00:15:19,106
and the broadcast service.

336
00:15:24,646 --> 00:15:26,906
So let's take a look at the

337
00:15:27,286 --> 00:15:29,676
So to initiate a

338
00:15:30,046 --> 00:15:32,416
we use a new class

339
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:34,506
ViewController, and

340
00:15:34,506 --> 00:15:35,446
to get an instance of it.

341
00:15:36,266 --> 00:15:39,386
We then simply present it as you

342
00:15:40,116 --> 00:15:41,646
which will then present

343
00:15:41,646 --> 00:15:43,926
of broadcast services, and

344
00:15:44,146 --> 00:15:45,166
to set up the broadcast.

345
00:15:46,306 --> 00:15:47,566
Just before we do that, though,

346
00:15:47,646 --> 00:15:49,566
we also set the

347
00:15:49,706 --> 00:15:50,376
delegate method.

348
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:53,596
Because we want to be notified

349
00:15:55,436 --> 00:15:57,536
At this point, the user

350
00:15:57,536 --> 00:15:59,916
to broadcast to, sets

351
00:16:00,096 --> 00:16:01,606
and once we you done setting up,

352
00:16:02,176 --> 00:16:04,346
the activity view controller's

353
00:16:05,286 --> 00:16:07,376
and this delegate method

354
00:16:07,376 --> 00:16:10,206
of another new class,

355
00:16:10,606 --> 00:16:12,316
which allows us to

356
00:16:12,996 --> 00:16:15,006
But before we do that,

357
00:16:15,006 --> 00:16:17,506
to dismiss the

358
00:16:17,886 --> 00:16:19,506
since we are the ones

359
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:21,816
Start our in game

360
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:24,246
and when the countdown

361
00:16:24,856 --> 00:16:28,256
we finally start the broadcast

362
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:32,266
on the new RPBroadcastController

363
00:16:32,696 --> 00:16:35,156
And now we are live.

364
00:16:35,576 --> 00:16:36,946
And since we're live

365
00:16:37,266 --> 00:16:39,196
we need to clearly

366
00:16:39,896 --> 00:16:41,696
So Olympus Rising

367
00:16:42,066 --> 00:16:43,566
by animating the

368
00:16:44,146 --> 00:16:46,666
Since the game has

369
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:48,996
they're reusing the button

370
00:16:48,996 --> 00:16:50,206
in progress broadcast,

371
00:16:50,606 --> 00:16:52,276
maximizing the available

372
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:55,946
Something to note is that the

373
00:16:55,946 --> 00:16:58,966
during broadcasting and will

374
00:17:00,296 --> 00:17:01,596
before you add this

375
00:17:01,596 --> 00:17:05,326
So programmatically check

376
00:17:05,496 --> 00:17:07,506
simply query is broadcasting

377
00:17:07,506 --> 00:17:08,636
of the broadcast controller.

378
00:17:09,435 --> 00:17:11,965
You can use the value of

379
00:17:12,326 --> 00:17:14,776
or stop animating

380
00:17:16,576 --> 00:17:18,695
To allow users to

381
00:17:18,816 --> 00:17:21,215
the Flair developers have

382
00:17:21,215 --> 00:17:23,886
that reveals a sub menu

383
00:17:24,736 --> 00:17:26,386
When the player presses

384
00:17:27,136 --> 00:17:30,366
we simply call finish

385
00:17:31,426 --> 00:17:33,666
When broadcasting is

386
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:36,846
Alright, now that we

387
00:17:36,996 --> 00:17:39,696
let's look at a few more

388
00:17:41,656 --> 00:17:43,956
So since there are a lot of

389
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:45,726
it's possible that

390
00:17:45,726 --> 00:17:47,936
So it is important to

391
00:17:48,546 --> 00:17:51,586
And so let's take a look at how

392
00:17:52,716 --> 00:17:54,586
To handle errors,

393
00:17:54,586 --> 00:17:55,786
to the broadcast controller.

394
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:59,736
Once set, your delegate

395
00:17:59,736 --> 00:18:03,926
with error method called

396
00:17:59,736 --> 00:18:03,926
with error method called

397
00:18:03,926 --> 00:18:05,496
you should let the

398
00:18:05,596 --> 00:18:06,976
and update any necessary UI.

399
00:18:07,626 --> 00:18:10,816
So now another detail

400
00:18:10,816 --> 00:18:12,246
when the user backgrounds

401
00:18:12,246 --> 00:18:14,606
or the app is interrupted

402
00:18:14,936 --> 00:18:16,546
like when receiving a

403
00:18:16,586 --> 00:18:19,616
So when the application

404
00:18:19,616 --> 00:18:21,996
ReplayKit will automatically

405
00:18:21,996 --> 00:18:24,286
So in this particular example,

406
00:18:24,286 --> 00:18:26,476
when the application is

407
00:18:26,476 --> 00:18:29,256
to the foreground, we prompt

408
00:18:29,256 --> 00:18:30,516
like to resume the broadcast.

409
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:33,506
If the user wants

410
00:18:33,506 --> 00:18:35,856
the resume broadcast

411
00:18:36,086 --> 00:18:38,216
simply call the finish

412
00:18:38,466 --> 00:18:40,456
And that's it.

413
00:18:40,756 --> 00:18:43,186
For the entire flow, the game

414
00:18:43,186 --> 00:18:45,196
with two classes,

415
00:18:45,566 --> 00:18:47,466
RPBroadcastActivity

416
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:50,276
to present broadcast services,

417
00:18:50,276 --> 00:18:53,796
up a broadcast, and

418
00:18:53,886 --> 00:18:56,086
pause, resume and

419
00:18:57,156 --> 00:18:59,866
As you can see, it couldn't

420
00:18:59,866 --> 00:19:01,796
into your games, and

421
00:18:59,866 --> 00:19:01,796
into your games, and

422
00:19:01,796 --> 00:19:03,456
because the benefits are huge.

423
00:19:03,716 --> 00:19:05,856
There is really no better

424
00:19:06,466 --> 00:19:07,986
increase player engagement

425
00:19:08,256 --> 00:19:10,536
and even build a

426
00:19:10,856 --> 00:19:14,636
So that covers game

427
00:19:14,806 --> 00:19:16,436
but what about the

428
00:19:16,536 --> 00:19:18,716
that players are streaming

429
00:19:18,936 --> 00:19:21,466
Let's take a moment

430
00:19:21,466 --> 00:19:23,466
about what those services

431
00:19:24,186 --> 00:19:25,966
So for all the game

432
00:19:26,106 --> 00:19:28,796
or watching online, I just

433
00:19:28,966 --> 00:19:29,836
that the topics discussed

434
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:32,386
in the next section are

435
00:19:32,386 --> 00:19:35,876
to implement in your games.

436
00:19:35,876 --> 00:19:37,376
So let's go back to

437
00:19:37,996 --> 00:19:39,476
We've seen that the

438
00:19:39,476 --> 00:19:42,676
for initiating the

439
00:19:42,676 --> 00:19:44,216
when to start and

440
00:19:44,716 --> 00:19:45,796
We have also seen that the UI

441
00:19:46,046 --> 00:19:47,846
for broadcast selection

442
00:19:47,846 --> 00:19:50,366
of by ReplayKit's

443
00:19:51,306 --> 00:19:53,136
So this leaves us with

444
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:57,626
Setting up the broadcast, and

445
00:19:57,626 --> 00:19:58,616
to the back-up servers.

446
00:19:59,096 --> 00:20:02,586
So to allow broadcast services

447
00:19:59,096 --> 00:20:02,586
So to allow broadcast services

448
00:20:02,586 --> 00:20:03,746
we're introducing a new pair

449
00:20:03,746 --> 00:20:05,976
of app extensions

450
00:20:07,296 --> 00:20:10,596
A UI extension, to allow the

451
00:20:11,806 --> 00:20:13,686
and a non-UI extension

452
00:20:13,876 --> 00:20:16,606
and uploading the

453
00:20:18,026 --> 00:20:20,306
For those of you

454
00:20:20,606 --> 00:20:23,896
they're target embedded in your

455
00:20:24,106 --> 00:20:26,446
to extend your app so that

456
00:20:26,446 --> 00:20:26,986
other apps.

457
00:20:27,876 --> 00:20:30,456
They run in a separate

458
00:20:30,886 --> 00:20:32,916
but can share data with

459
00:20:33,016 --> 00:20:34,386
which can be handy

460
00:20:34,386 --> 00:20:35,956
like authentication

461
00:20:37,156 --> 00:20:38,836
So one thing to keep

462
00:20:39,206 --> 00:20:40,346
is that extensions are limited

463
00:20:40,346 --> 00:20:42,126
in resources compared

464
00:20:42,126 --> 00:20:45,326
So try to refrain from doing

465
00:20:45,326 --> 00:20:46,246
within them.

466
00:20:47,196 --> 00:20:49,086
We made it incredibly

467
00:20:49,086 --> 00:20:50,916
up these extensions

468
00:20:51,676 --> 00:20:55,056
These are available as new

469
00:20:56,326 --> 00:20:57,776
If created from this template,

470
00:20:57,776 --> 00:21:00,206
the extensions will be

471
00:20:57,776 --> 00:21:00,206
the extensions will be

472
00:21:00,206 --> 00:21:02,316
up in the broadcast

473
00:21:03,986 --> 00:21:06,516
So let's take a look at

474
00:21:06,516 --> 00:21:08,136
that a broadcast service

475
00:21:08,696 --> 00:21:10,726
starting with the

476
00:21:12,196 --> 00:21:14,876
UI extension has a few

477
00:21:15,106 --> 00:21:17,326
first it's responsible for

478
00:21:17,656 --> 00:21:19,826
and providing sign up if the

479
00:21:20,686 --> 00:21:23,176
Ideally, this should all be

480
00:21:23,176 --> 00:21:25,326
so that the user's

481
00:21:25,956 --> 00:21:28,056
But is also perfectly

482
00:21:28,056 --> 00:21:31,106
up to the parent application

483
00:21:31,106 --> 00:21:34,376
to get back to the game.

484
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:36,066
So, during sign up

485
00:21:36,066 --> 00:21:37,606
that the user be shown

486
00:21:37,606 --> 00:21:40,756
for using the service, and be

487
00:21:40,956 --> 00:21:42,366
or decline those

488
00:21:43,766 --> 00:21:46,806
So as we saw earlier, UI

489
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:48,646
for allowing the user to

490
00:21:48,646 --> 00:21:52,776
like adding a title to it,

491
00:21:52,906 --> 00:21:54,556
to notify others

492
00:21:54,556 --> 00:21:56,416
about to begin via social media.

493
00:21:58,066 --> 00:22:00,616
Finally, its final

494
00:21:58,066 --> 00:22:00,616
Finally, its final

495
00:22:00,616 --> 00:22:02,626
ReplayKit, and ultimately

496
00:22:03,126 --> 00:22:04,736
that broadcast set

497
00:22:04,986 --> 00:22:09,396
So now that we looked at the

498
00:22:09,396 --> 00:22:10,586
over to the upload extension.

499
00:22:11,396 --> 00:22:14,166
It is responsible for

500
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:17,036
and audio data, and

501
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:18,036
to the back-end servers.

502
00:22:18,756 --> 00:22:21,706
So we are aware there are

503
00:22:21,706 --> 00:22:24,416
of data processing and

504
00:22:24,976 --> 00:22:27,566
So I won't be getting into any

505
00:22:27,566 --> 00:22:28,106
this session.

506
00:22:28,546 --> 00:22:32,386
Instead, if you are a broadcast

507
00:22:32,556 --> 00:22:34,346
with us, so we can

508
00:22:34,906 --> 00:22:36,386
This way we can implement

509
00:22:36,446 --> 00:22:38,756
that delivers the best

510
00:22:41,046 --> 00:22:43,806
So going back to our flow

511
00:22:43,806 --> 00:22:46,086
at the broadcast

512
00:22:46,246 --> 00:22:49,576
We have gone through the

513
00:22:50,506 --> 00:22:52,786
And we've clearly broken

514
00:22:52,786 --> 00:22:56,666
of the game, ReplayKit

515
00:22:57,096 --> 00:22:59,566
and that was live broadcasting.

516
00:23:00,246 --> 00:23:02,666
We really feel this is

517
00:23:03,216 --> 00:23:05,026
that you players

518
00:23:05,296 --> 00:23:07,596
and for developers it is

519
00:23:07,596 --> 00:23:10,586
for your fans to experience your

520
00:23:10,946 --> 00:23:12,006
but by watching them as well.

521
00:23:14,386 --> 00:23:16,086
So before we go, I'd like to end

522
00:23:16,086 --> 00:23:17,916
with a few new enhancements

523
00:23:18,536 --> 00:23:20,146
around commentary for iOS.

524
00:23:20,276 --> 00:23:21,956
Namely, support for the

525
00:23:22,516 --> 00:23:24,666
and also a new capability

526
00:23:26,006 --> 00:23:28,586
So first up, we've added

527
00:23:28,796 --> 00:23:30,866
making it incredibly convenient

528
00:23:30,866 --> 00:23:32,916
in picture video

529
00:23:33,806 --> 00:23:36,406
Player reaction is

530
00:23:36,406 --> 00:23:38,876
that special flavor to

531
00:23:39,156 --> 00:23:41,266
So to enable this

532
00:23:41,346 --> 00:23:43,776
the Flair developers have added

533
00:23:43,776 --> 00:23:44,596
in their fly out menu.

534
00:23:45,386 --> 00:23:48,106
Pressing this button enables

535
00:23:48,106 --> 00:23:48,956
at the top left.

536
00:23:50,566 --> 00:23:53,376
So let's look at the API

537
00:23:54,736 --> 00:23:55,986
To toggle the camera on,

538
00:23:55,986 --> 00:23:58,446
we simply set the

539
00:23:58,446 --> 00:24:01,736
on RPScreenRecorder, this

540
00:23:58,446 --> 00:24:01,736
on RPScreenRecorder, this

541
00:24:02,236 --> 00:24:05,186
and populates a new

542
00:24:05,216 --> 00:24:07,806
CameraPreviewView, which

543
00:24:08,096 --> 00:24:11,766
Since it is UI view, you can

544
00:24:11,766 --> 00:24:14,146
to your game view, and

545
00:24:14,146 --> 00:24:16,266
so that it does not

546
00:24:16,706 --> 00:24:19,956
You can even attach a Adjust

547
00:24:19,956 --> 00:24:21,996
and allows you to position

548
00:24:23,306 --> 00:24:24,826
So looking at the code here,

549
00:24:25,176 --> 00:24:27,256
we're simply setting the

550
00:24:27,256 --> 00:24:29,036
to True during recording

551
00:24:29,526 --> 00:24:36,796
Then we get a CameraPreviewView

552
00:24:36,846 --> 00:24:39,806
to position it, and

553
00:24:39,806 --> 00:24:41,326
as a sub view to your game view.

554
00:24:43,446 --> 00:24:45,916
So now that we have video

555
00:24:45,916 --> 00:24:46,906
to pair that with audio.

556
00:24:47,796 --> 00:24:50,876
So microphone recording was

557
00:24:51,416 --> 00:24:52,726
but now we are including

558
00:24:52,726 --> 00:24:54,676
to mute it during

559
00:24:55,266 --> 00:24:57,496
So we all know broadcasters

560
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:58,376
interesting to say,

561
00:24:58,706 --> 00:25:00,546
but sometimes even

562
00:24:58,706 --> 00:25:00,546
but sometimes even

563
00:25:01,866 --> 00:25:03,516
So Olympus Rising

564
00:25:03,516 --> 00:25:05,936
by including a microphone

565
00:25:07,406 --> 00:25:08,576
Implementing the action

566
00:25:08,636 --> 00:25:10,716
to microphone toggle

567
00:25:10,966 --> 00:25:13,436
The existing IsMicrophoneEnabled

568
00:25:13,706 --> 00:25:16,576
on RPScreenRecorder can

569
00:25:16,576 --> 00:25:19,786
to enable the microphone, and

570
00:25:20,906 --> 00:25:23,236
Again this can all be

571
00:25:23,306 --> 00:25:23,966
or recording session.

572
00:25:27,516 --> 00:25:28,966
Alright so that concludes

573
00:25:29,056 --> 00:25:30,496
and I really hope

574
00:25:30,966 --> 00:25:33,636
With the powerful new broadcast

575
00:25:33,686 --> 00:25:36,006
for Apple TV, we

576
00:25:36,416 --> 00:25:40,806
and watch your games live

577
00:25:41,326 --> 00:25:44,356
For more information,

578
00:25:44,356 --> 00:25:48,476
session 601, and during the

579
00:25:48,476 --> 00:25:50,386
out our other game

580
00:25:50,516 --> 00:25:53,956
what's new in GameplayKit,

581
00:25:54,396 --> 00:25:56,546
Okay, so that's it for me.

582
00:25:56,776 --> 00:25:58,516
Thanks so much for attending

583
00:25:58,516 --> 00:26:01,966
that you enjoy the rest

584
00:25:58,516 --> 00:26:01,966
that you enjoy the rest

585
00:26:02,076 --> 00:26:02,816
Thanks so much.
