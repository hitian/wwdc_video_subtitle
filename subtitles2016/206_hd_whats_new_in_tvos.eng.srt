We're really thrilled

[ Applause ]

8
00:00:44,106 --> 00:00:45,686
So I'd like to begin

9
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:47,746
with a brief overview of tvOS.

10
00:00:47,746 --> 00:00:52,066
And we'll walk you through some

11
00:00:52,596 --> 00:00:56,766
And then we'll take a few of

12
00:00:57,506 --> 00:00:59,056
And we even have

13
00:01:00,686 --> 00:01:03,636
So let's begin.

14
00:01:03,776 --> 00:01:06,586
Just nine months ago we

15
00:01:07,336 --> 00:01:09,246
and with it the tvOS.

16
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:14,106
tvOS is a modern

17
00:01:14,216 --> 00:01:17,696
for modern hardware,

18
00:01:18,146 --> 00:01:19,626
with no 32-bit runtime.

19
00:01:20,766 --> 00:01:23,376
So it would save you

20
00:01:23,546 --> 00:01:27,496
that you'd spent testing

21
00:01:28,096 --> 00:01:30,106
or configuring for

22
00:01:30,706 --> 00:01:38,326
And unlike your iPhone,

23
00:01:39,436 --> 00:01:41,936
the Apple TV is always connected

24
00:01:42,916 --> 00:01:45,936
And this makes tvOS

25
00:01:46,386 --> 00:01:51,316
where you can offload some tasks

26
00:01:52,086 --> 00:01:56,276

27
00:01:56,276 --> 00:02:00,076
such as CloudKit and

28
00:01:56,276 --> 00:02:00,076
such as CloudKit and

29
00:02:02,016 --> 00:02:04,516
CloudKit is your interface

It also provides a public and

33
00:02:18,046 --> 00:02:19,746
So as you've heard in

34
00:02:20,476 --> 00:02:24,346
it can be accessed from

35
00:02:24,346 --> 00:02:26,636
and can also be shared.

on other platforms that

00:02:45,786 --> 00:02:50,406
And by using CloudKit JS and its

to be able to launch

46
00:03:06,396 --> 00:03:09,876
And as app grows in size,

47
00:03:10,586 --> 00:03:15,456
Because we don't wait 800

48
00:03:15,726 --> 00:03:19,236
And this is not only

49
00:03:19,236 --> 00:03:21,226
but also a challenge

50
00:03:21,986 --> 00:03:24,536
because customers

51
00:03:24,536 --> 00:03:29,126
in our apps before they

52
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:32,626

of Apple TV's constant

54
00:03:35,806 --> 00:03:37,036
and provides a mechanism

55
00:03:37,086 --> 00:03:39,606
by which your app can

56
00:03:39,606 --> 00:03:40,846
of its content is downloaded.

57
00:03:42,176 --> 00:03:44,656
This means for your customers,

58
00:03:45,186 --> 00:03:48,016
And while the app

59
00:03:49,336 --> 00:03:52,126
the system can continue

60
00:03:52,586 --> 00:03:55,066
so they're ready

61
00:03:55,826 --> 00:03:58,376
minimizing further wait time.

62
00:04:00,436 --> 00:04:06,406
And also, applications can

63
00:04:06,786 --> 00:04:09,596
much larger than was

64
00:04:10,696 --> 00:04:15,096
Let's take a look at this.

65
00:04:15,326 --> 00:04:17,555
Every app has a main app bundle

66
00:04:17,906 --> 00:04:20,086
of executable and

67
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:24,336
And when using ODR, your

68
00:04:24,706 --> 00:04:26,566
up to 200 megabytes.

69
00:04:28,096 --> 00:04:32,056
To this you can add a first

70
00:04:32,706 --> 00:04:35,576
with the app bundle so they're

71
00:04:35,576 --> 00:04:41,366
For example, this could be the

72
00:04:41,566 --> 00:04:44,196
This first set is called

73
00:04:44,286 --> 00:04:47,946
and this can be up

74
00:04:48,556 --> 00:04:51,416
What if you have more contents?

75
00:04:52,366 --> 00:04:56,676
Well, you can specific

76
00:04:56,676 --> 00:04:59,406
to be downloaded

77
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:03,406
And this is called

78
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:03,406
And this is called

79
00:05:04,736 --> 00:05:07,506
And prefetch tags are

80
00:05:07,506 --> 00:05:10,556
that you know you'll need

81
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:13,026
to justify blocking your

82
00:05:13,296 --> 00:05:16,826
thereby preventing your

83
00:05:17,806 --> 00:05:26,226
So, for example, if your user is

84
00:05:27,396 --> 00:05:29,426
the system will start

85
00:05:29,426 --> 00:05:30,186
five, and six.

86
00:05:31,336 --> 00:05:34,976
And by the time the user is

87
00:05:35,986 --> 00:05:37,876
the next levels are

88
00:05:37,876 --> 00:05:39,266
and waiting for the user.

89
00:05:40,486 --> 00:05:44,426
So the wait has been shifted

90
00:05:44,426 --> 00:05:50,436
And the system doesn't mind

91
00:05:50,966 --> 00:05:53,266
Prefetch tags can be

92
00:05:53,886 --> 00:05:56,886
using the rest of the allowance.

93
00:05:58,216 --> 00:06:01,276
So, for example, if

94
00:05:58,216 --> 00:06:01,276
So, for example, if

95
00:06:01,276 --> 00:06:02,496
for initial install tags,

96
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:07,466
then you have 3.5

97
00:06:08,356 --> 00:06:11,176
If you've spent all

98
00:06:11,176 --> 00:06:12,436
of your initial install tags,

99
00:06:12,896 --> 00:06:15,476
then naturally you

100
00:06:15,476 --> 00:06:16,526
for your prefetch tags.

101
00:06:17,756 --> 00:06:20,596
What if you had no

102
00:06:21,356 --> 00:06:23,256
Well, math says it's

103
00:06:23,256 --> 00:06:24,256
for your prefetch tags.

104
00:06:24,336 --> 00:06:27,506

of the parallax effect is

00:10:12,556 --> 00:10:15,716
A layered image is an image

00:10:19,806 --> 00:10:21,086
when an element is in focus.

164
00:10:21,696 --> 00:10:26,636
It can have up to five layers

165

00:12:15,346 --> 00:12:17,246
we believe the future

193
00:12:18,746 --> 00:12:21,956
And all of this is

194
00:12:22,676 --> 00:12:28,166
The App Store, just like on

195
00:12:28,676 --> 00:12:30,596
discover, and download apps.

196
00:12:31,986 --> 00:12:36,636
And because it exists

197
00:12:36,826 --> 00:12:38,576
it supports universal purchase.

198
00:12:39,996 --> 00:12:42,816
So if your customer has

199
00:12:43,636 --> 00:12:45,076
they can enjoy the app on tvOS

200
00:12:45,076 --> 00:12:47,826
with just one button

201
00:12:48,146 --> 00:12:53,326
And thanks to Apple TV's

202
00:12:53,696 --> 00:12:57,386
in tvOS 10 we're

203
00:12:58,466 --> 00:13:02,326
So apps downloaded on iOS will

204
00:12:58,466 --> 00:13:02,326
So apps downloaded on iOS will

205
00:13:02,326 --> 00:13:06,826
to the TV just like that.

206
00:13:07,276 --> 00:13:09,106
So it's even easier

207
00:13:09,146 --> 00:13:10,326
to get a hold of your apps.

208
00:13:11,846 --> 00:13:16,406
But how are you going

209
00:13:16,506 --> 00:13:19,606
tvOS offers the same

210
00:13:20,696 --> 00:13:23,446
as iOS, Mac OS, and watchOS.

211
00:13:23,446 --> 00:13:27,556
And many of the same frameworks

212
00:13:27,906 --> 00:13:33,066
such as UIKit, Foundation,

213
00:13:33,506 --> 00:13:38,436
Core Audio, and so on and so

214
00:13:39,566 --> 00:13:43,746
And by the way, in tvOS 9.2

215
00:13:44,286 --> 00:13:47,506
But this is still a partial list

216
00:13:47,506 --> 00:13:50,106
of a whole lot more you

217
00:13:50,646 --> 00:13:53,796
For example, if you're

218
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:57,156
you'd be excited to learn

219
00:13:57,156 --> 00:14:02,056
that you love are all

220
00:13:57,156 --> 00:14:02,056
that you love are all

221
00:14:02,636 --> 00:14:07,266
Game Controller, GameplayKit,

222
00:14:07,536 --> 00:14:11,636
Performance Traders, SpriteKit,

223
00:14:11,986 --> 00:14:14,146
these are all available

224
00:14:15,826 --> 00:14:21,956
And finally, tvOS introduces a

225
00:14:22,436 --> 00:14:23,566
called TVMLKit.

226
00:14:23,566 --> 00:14:28,816
TVMLKit makes it

227
00:14:28,816 --> 00:14:32,186
to build content-centric

228
00:14:32,186 --> 00:14:34,256
of the heavy lifting,

229
00:14:34,696 --> 00:14:36,136
and focus management, for you.

230
00:14:37,286 --> 00:14:41,866
And it does so with

231
00:14:42,636 --> 00:14:44,596
and JavaScript for

232
00:14:45,456 --> 00:14:48,326
It is really great for rapidly

233
00:14:48,326 --> 00:14:51,496
And, of course, it's tuned

234
00:14:52,136 --> 00:14:58,256
In fact, several of Apple's own

235
00:14:58,976 --> 00:14:59,976
the Movies app.

236
00:14:59,976 --> 00:15:05,716
And that's right, the App Store

237
00:14:59,976 --> 00:15:05,716
And that's right, the App Store

238
00:15:05,966 --> 00:15:13,606
And all of the developer tools

239
00:15:13,606 --> 00:15:18,516
and optimize your apps, such

240
00:15:18,926 --> 00:15:27,276
and TestFlight are also

241
00:15:27,456 --> 00:15:31,756
This year tvOS continues to

242
00:15:32,576 --> 00:15:37,346
As you've heard in the keynote,

243
00:15:37,346 --> 00:15:39,926
so you can control

244
00:15:39,926 --> 00:15:41,266
from your TV.

245
00:15:42,156 --> 00:15:44,106
We're also bringing PhotoKit

246
00:15:44,106 --> 00:15:50,716
so your app can leverage your

247
00:15:50,876 --> 00:15:56,546
Using SpriteKit is even easier

248
00:15:56,616 --> 00:15:57,536
from the focus engine.

249
00:15:58,376 --> 00:16:02,396
Your movement and navigation

250
00:15:58,376 --> 00:16:02,396
Your movement and navigation

251
00:16:03,746 --> 00:16:06,556
and fully integrated with

252
00:16:07,866 --> 00:16:12,486
Speaking of movement and

253
00:16:12,486 --> 00:16:14,336
of gameplay is how

254
00:16:14,926 --> 00:16:20,096
You can hold the Siri

255
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:26,046
as a lightweight game controller

256
00:16:26,196 --> 00:16:30,776
and clicks for jumping, for

257
00:16:32,086 --> 00:16:36,236
If your title requires

258
00:16:37,136 --> 00:16:42,546
you can hold it landscape as a

259
00:16:42,546 --> 00:16:44,266
and two-button controls.

260
00:16:44,266 --> 00:16:50,106
Well, if your game title

261
00:16:50,106 --> 00:16:52,956
input, you can use the

262
00:16:52,956 --> 00:16:57,766
and as you heard in the State of

263
00:16:57,976 --> 00:17:01,316
You now have an option

264
00:16:57,976 --> 00:17:01,316
You now have an option

265
00:17:01,316 --> 00:17:02,976
of MFI-based game controllers,

266
00:17:02,976 --> 00:17:06,246
and the app store will

267
00:17:06,246 --> 00:17:07,076
if it's necessary.

268
00:17:08,806 --> 00:17:13,026
We're also bringing

269
00:17:14,556 --> 00:17:19,116
Using ReplayKit, players can

270
00:17:19,116 --> 00:17:23,705
on device and share it

271
00:17:24,925 --> 00:17:28,886
But that's not all; game

272
00:17:28,886 --> 00:17:32,316
gameplays live on

273
00:17:32,876 --> 00:17:42,446
In tvOS 10 we're also

274
00:17:42,656 --> 00:17:45,136
UserNotification.framework

275
00:17:46,296 --> 00:17:49,776
and also

276
00:17:49,776 --> 00:17:52,406
for Bluetooth accessories

277
00:17:53,756 --> 00:17:58,666
We're also shipping a brand

278
00:17:58,966 --> 00:18:02,626
And finally, users can set

279
00:17:58,966 --> 00:18:02,626
And finally, users can set

280
00:18:02,656 --> 00:18:04,096
to light or dark.

281
00:18:04,706 --> 00:18:08,946
And when you're actually

282
00:18:10,406 --> 00:18:11,296
you have many options.

283
00:18:11,756 --> 00:18:17,216
You might want to use UIKit as

284
00:18:17,216 --> 00:18:19,236
of all the available frameworks.

285
00:18:19,826 --> 00:18:22,856
If you're already comfortable

286
00:18:22,856 --> 00:18:26,736
or if you have an

287
00:18:27,706 --> 00:18:30,546
we have some great sessions

288
00:18:31,066 --> 00:18:35,166
including mastering

289
00:18:35,346 --> 00:18:38,856
where you can take your

290
00:18:38,856 --> 00:18:41,726
And in Focus Interaction

291
00:18:41,726 --> 00:18:47,016
we review the Focus system,

292
00:18:47,016 --> 00:18:50,646
on tvOS 10, and of

293
00:18:53,996 --> 00:18:56,726
We also recommend that

294
00:18:58,596 --> 00:19:01,916
TVMLKit is an incredibly

295
00:18:58,596 --> 00:19:01,916
TVMLKit is an incredibly

296
00:19:02,876 --> 00:19:08,186
And if your skillset already

297
00:19:08,776 --> 00:19:12,996
it's really easy to use

298
00:19:13,056 --> 00:19:14,866
and deploy content-centric apps.

299
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:20,746
And because TVMLKit is built on

300
00:19:20,746 --> 00:19:22,836
in UIKit for further

301
00:19:23,386 --> 00:19:29,356
And these sessions focus on

302
00:19:29,796 --> 00:19:31,916
and we highly encourage you

303
00:19:32,936 --> 00:19:35,176
And if you are a game

304
00:19:35,996 --> 00:19:38,316
all the game technologies

305
00:19:38,316 --> 00:19:40,786
as GameKit might

306
00:19:45,546 --> 00:19:51,096
Next I'd like to switch gears

307
00:19:51,096 --> 00:19:52,926
of the new features in tvOS 10.

308
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:55,066
And for that, I'd

309
00:19:55,066 --> 00:19:56,436
over to my colleague,

310
00:19:57,516 --> 00:20:04,646
[ Applause ]

311
00:19:57,516 --> 00:20:04,646
[ Applause ]

312
00:20:05,146 --> 00:20:05,816
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon.

313
00:20:05,816 --> 00:20:06,576
My name is Marshall.

314
00:20:06,656 --> 00:20:07,866
I'm a tvOS engineer.

315
00:20:07,906 --> 00:20:11,096
And today we're going to dive

316
00:20:11,096 --> 00:20:14,436
of the new features

317
00:20:15,676 --> 00:20:16,996
We heard in the keynote

318
00:20:16,996 --> 00:20:18,966
that there's a new

319
00:20:20,106 --> 00:20:22,756
We'll take a look at how

320
00:20:23,056 --> 00:20:25,656
to notify users when you

321
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:28,056
And finally, we're going to look

322
00:20:28,296 --> 00:20:30,476
at how you can implement

323
00:20:30,476 --> 00:20:31,906
in your app.

324
00:20:33,796 --> 00:20:38,076
So the new Apple TV Remote app

325
00:20:38,076 --> 00:20:39,826
so there's no changes

326
00:20:40,266 --> 00:20:41,276
for your app to make it work.

327
00:20:42,296 --> 00:20:45,256
It also includes a new

328
00:20:45,726 --> 00:20:47,446
so users can use

329
00:20:47,576 --> 00:20:53,436
Now, if the user is using the

330
00:20:53,436 --> 00:20:56,126
against the game controller

331
00:20:56,126 --> 00:20:57,956
to get a new icon in

332
00:20:57,956 --> 00:20:59,196
that looks like this.

333
00:21:00,126 --> 00:21:03,536
When that user taps that

334
00:21:03,606 --> 00:21:05,336
with a Game Controller

335
00:21:05,336 --> 00:21:06,336
by rotating the phone.

336
00:21:07,756 --> 00:21:10,386
To learn more how

337
00:21:10,676 --> 00:21:11,956
of Game Controller framework,

338
00:21:11,956 --> 00:21:13,606
we have a session coming

339
00:21:15,036 --> 00:21:17,126
Also, as you heard, the

340
00:21:17,126 --> 00:21:20,866
So go download it

341
00:21:21,136 --> 00:21:23,966
Next we're going to take

342
00:21:24,296 --> 00:21:26,316
and how you can use

343
00:21:26,316 --> 00:21:27,956
when you have new

344
00:21:28,746 --> 00:21:30,326
A great way of doing

345
00:21:30,326 --> 00:21:32,926
to is badging your

346
00:21:32,926 --> 00:21:35,126
And we've added this

347
00:21:36,466 --> 00:21:39,676
Now, like iOS you're required

348
00:21:39,676 --> 00:21:41,936
from the user in order to

349
00:21:42,286 --> 00:21:44,206
But on tvOS this looks

350
00:21:44,726 --> 00:21:46,836
They're going to get a

351
00:21:47,636 --> 00:21:49,986
So make sure that you

352
00:21:49,986 --> 00:21:52,916
at an appropriate time, or this

353
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:55,386
user has with your app.

354
00:21:55,926 --> 00:21:58,906
We've also added support

355
00:21:58,906 --> 00:22:01,556
so you can use Apple's

356
00:21:58,906 --> 00:22:01,556
so you can use Apple's

357
00:22:01,866 --> 00:22:03,136
to send remote notifications.

358
00:22:04,126 --> 00:22:06,716
We support two notification

359
00:22:06,866 --> 00:22:11,986
Those are Badge, which we just

360
00:22:13,466 --> 00:22:16,066
Now, if your app is

361
00:22:16,066 --> 00:22:18,646
then these content-available

362
00:22:18,646 --> 00:22:20,816
up your app like you

363
00:22:20,906 --> 00:22:22,946
Let's take a look

364
00:22:24,136 --> 00:22:26,696
So say your user has

365
00:22:26,696 --> 00:22:29,516
A great way to notify them would

366
00:22:29,596 --> 00:22:31,716
with content-available

367
00:22:31,876 --> 00:22:34,406
If the application's

368
00:22:34,406 --> 00:22:37,596
onto this notification and

369
00:22:37,596 --> 00:22:40,046
Now, the user gets

370
00:22:40,236 --> 00:22:42,186
so you can send another

371
00:22:42,496 --> 00:22:43,856
that updates the Badge icon.

372
00:22:44,826 --> 00:22:49,416
tvOS will hold onto the

373
00:22:49,416 --> 00:22:50,286
for the app to come back.

374
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:52,636
And finally, you get

375
00:22:52,636 --> 00:22:53,986
and you can update

376
00:22:53,986 --> 00:22:56,676
When the user is ready

377
00:22:56,676 --> 00:22:59,286
and see what they have is

378
00:22:59,466 --> 00:23:02,286
And then we deliver that last

379
00:22:59,466 --> 00:23:02,286
And then we deliver that last

380
00:23:02,286 --> 00:23:04,426
to your servers and get

381
00:23:04,706 --> 00:23:05,296
that's available.

382
00:23:05,296 --> 00:23:09,326
In order to support

383
00:23:09,326 --> 00:23:11,346
to use the new user

384
00:23:12,066 --> 00:23:15,486
If you've implemented

385
00:23:15,706 --> 00:23:17,796
you might be used to

386
00:23:18,436 --> 00:23:20,846
Well, those have been

387
00:23:20,846 --> 00:23:22,176
and they're going to

388
00:23:22,176 --> 00:23:23,786
So in order to fully

389
00:23:23,786 --> 00:23:25,606
and [inaudible] notifications,

390
00:23:25,606 --> 00:23:28,076
to use the new user

391
00:23:28,076 --> 00:23:30,766
We have a few sessions

392
00:23:30,766 --> 00:23:34,586
on how you can learn to fully

393
00:23:35,176 --> 00:23:38,296
And finally today, we're going

394
00:23:38,296 --> 00:23:39,676
and dark appearance on tvOS.

395
00:23:41,286 --> 00:23:44,486
We see that that this is a

396
00:23:45,106 --> 00:23:47,736
The user will determine

397
00:23:47,736 --> 00:23:48,626
between light or dark.

398
00:23:48,816 --> 00:23:50,916
Now, something to consider is

399
00:23:50,916 --> 00:23:53,316
that users might have their

400
00:23:53,316 --> 00:23:55,236
It could be in a movie

401
00:23:55,236 --> 00:23:57,516
it could be in a living room,

402
00:23:57,886 --> 00:24:00,436
Or the user may change

403
00:23:57,886 --> 00:24:00,436
Or the user may change

404
00:24:01,056 --> 00:24:03,676
So it's important in order

405
00:24:03,676 --> 00:24:05,686
to offer them the

406
00:24:06,006 --> 00:24:09,896
In order to fully support

407
00:24:09,896 --> 00:24:16,176
on the UITraitCollection,

408
00:24:16,176 --> 00:24:17,396
for the dark appearance.

409
00:24:19,636 --> 00:24:23,096
If you don't opt-in for the dark

410
00:24:23,096 --> 00:24:25,356
in the light just

411
00:24:25,516 --> 00:24:30,636
So let's take a look at

412
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:33,176
to adopt the new light and

413
00:24:34,716 --> 00:24:38,146
The first step is to add a

414
00:24:38,206 --> 00:24:40,766
we've added one called

415
00:24:40,866 --> 00:24:44,656
If you set a value of Light, it

416
00:24:44,656 --> 00:24:47,726
If you set a value to Dark,

417
00:24:48,186 --> 00:24:52,026
Or if you use what we recommend,

418
00:24:52,026 --> 00:24:54,946
and the system setting and will

419
00:24:55,406 --> 00:24:59,966
If you create new projects

420
00:25:00,026 --> 00:25:01,666
this will actually

421
00:25:03,066 --> 00:25:05,926
I mentioned that there is

422
00:25:05,926 --> 00:25:08,536
We've added a new property

423
00:25:09,616 --> 00:25:11,346
This could have a

424
00:25:11,576 --> 00:25:14,026
which might the case if your

425
00:25:14,026 --> 00:25:17,836
in the view hierarchy yet, or if

426
00:25:17,836 --> 00:25:20,516
on what the system setting is

427
00:25:21,056 --> 00:25:27,466
In order to support

428
00:25:27,466 --> 00:25:29,066
we've added developer

429
00:25:29,436 --> 00:25:31,516
to Interface Builder

430
00:25:31,816 --> 00:25:34,456
If you use standard

431
00:25:34,456 --> 00:25:36,526
these will actually

432
00:25:36,956 --> 00:25:39,586
If you're used to using

433
00:25:39,586 --> 00:25:41,166
with a little bit

434
00:25:41,166 --> 00:25:44,226
you can then specify colors

435
00:25:45,016 --> 00:25:46,476
And if you want the

436
00:25:46,776 --> 00:25:48,896
you can implement

437
00:25:48,896 --> 00:25:50,516
in your views or

438
00:25:53,386 --> 00:25:56,806
Now in Interface Builder

439
00:25:56,806 --> 00:26:00,726
in the inspector

440
00:25:56,806 --> 00:26:00,726
in the inspector

441
00:26:00,916 --> 00:26:03,606
We added a light and dark

442
00:26:03,606 --> 00:26:05,976
so you can rapidly develop

443
00:26:06,646 --> 00:26:09,256
We've also added a shortcut

444
00:26:09,256 --> 00:26:11,666
to quick toggle between

445
00:26:14,596 --> 00:26:18,756
I mentioned UIKit controls

446
00:26:19,176 --> 00:26:21,206
And we use these a lot

447
00:26:21,546 --> 00:26:24,806
We see that certain views like

448
00:26:24,806 --> 00:26:27,186
or [inaudible] control

449
00:26:27,186 --> 00:26:29,006
to look best against

450
00:26:29,216 --> 00:26:32,016
If you use a table view like

451
00:26:32,016 --> 00:26:34,796
it will automatically adjust

452
00:26:35,006 --> 00:26:36,926
its text color, and

453
00:26:36,926 --> 00:26:39,536
And if you're using the

454
00:26:40,046 --> 00:26:41,506
than those adapt as well.

455
00:26:43,436 --> 00:26:47,546
If you're looking to customize

456
00:26:47,546 --> 00:26:49,456
to UILabel and UITextView,

457
00:26:49,756 --> 00:26:51,876
so those will automatically

458
00:26:53,036 --> 00:26:56,086
Text color will be set to

459
00:26:56,086 --> 00:26:58,636
it will be set to white

460
00:26:59,016 --> 00:27:01,466
But one caveat is if you

461
00:26:59,016 --> 00:27:01,466
But one caveat is if you

462
00:27:01,756 --> 00:27:03,696
then you're responsible

463
00:27:04,316 --> 00:27:06,346
for both those modes

464
00:27:07,816 --> 00:27:11,126
We've also added two new

465
00:27:12,436 --> 00:27:15,016
You can now use

466
00:27:15,096 --> 00:27:17,096
or UIBlurEffectStyleProminent.

467
00:27:17,536 --> 00:27:19,706
And we call these

468
00:27:19,706 --> 00:27:22,996
And they'll actually adjust

469
00:27:23,116 --> 00:27:24,886
based on what the

470
00:27:24,886 --> 00:27:27,836
So if you use

471
00:27:27,836 --> 00:27:29,006
and the system's in light,

472
00:27:29,006 --> 00:27:30,956
it will use

473
00:27:30,956 --> 00:27:33,696
If you use regular and

474
00:27:33,696 --> 00:27:37,326
If you use prominent, it will

475
00:27:38,386 --> 00:27:42,996
.extraDark will be

476
00:27:44,366 --> 00:27:47,056
Now, you might customize your

477
00:27:47,196 --> 00:27:49,836
So you might have code like this

478
00:27:50,266 --> 00:27:52,776
that sets the title

479
00:27:53,496 --> 00:27:54,796
With a little bit

480
00:27:55,156 --> 00:27:57,316
we can vend a TraitCollection

481
00:27:57,646 --> 00:28:01,026
And using the appearance

482
00:27:57,646 --> 00:28:01,026
And using the appearance

483
00:28:01,026 --> 00:28:02,736
for each of those

484
00:28:03,196 --> 00:28:06,686
Now in this case our button will

485
00:28:07,026 --> 00:28:08,856
and blue in the dark appearance.

486
00:28:09,476 --> 00:28:13,396
And finally, if you want the

487
00:28:13,666 --> 00:28:15,146
you can respond to

488
00:28:16,176 --> 00:28:18,406
You can do this using

489
00:28:18,406 --> 00:28:19,916
in your views or

490
00:28:20,166 --> 00:28:21,726
Let's take a look at

491
00:28:21,726 --> 00:28:22,436
of this would look like.

492
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:25,586
First we override

493
00:28:25,586 --> 00:28:26,376
in our view controller.

494
00:28:27,936 --> 00:28:31,586
Then we check to make sure

495
00:28:31,586 --> 00:28:33,186
to the new user interface

496
00:28:33,346 --> 00:28:36,486
This allows us to build this

497
00:28:36,816 --> 00:28:39,126
but still support users

498
00:28:39,626 --> 00:28:43,966
Next we check to see that the

499
00:28:43,966 --> 00:28:47,286
changed; otherwise we might be

500
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:51,666
And finally, we can check

501
00:28:51,666 --> 00:28:53,626
and update our controls

502
00:28:56,336 --> 00:28:59,246
Now, one more advanced use

503
00:28:59,246 --> 00:29:00,776
to override TraitCollections.

504
00:28:59,246 --> 00:29:00,776
to override TraitCollections.

505
00:29:00,776 --> 00:29:02,996
And this might be the case

506
00:29:03,466 --> 00:29:06,366
to support the automatic style

507
00:29:06,366 --> 00:29:08,316
or view controllers in

508
00:29:08,316 --> 00:29:10,366
to specify the style itself.

509
00:29:11,456 --> 00:29:16,406
We use this in our system apps,

510
00:29:16,406 --> 00:29:19,516
and TV shows actually

511
00:29:19,516 --> 00:29:20,726
on what the elements look like.

512
00:29:21,166 --> 00:29:24,446
In this case we have light

513
00:29:24,446 --> 00:29:27,016
in button styles that

514
00:29:27,716 --> 00:29:31,206
We also have dark pages where we

515
00:29:31,206 --> 00:29:33,286
and the buttons also

516
00:29:35,436 --> 00:29:37,706
In order to override

517
00:29:37,706 --> 00:29:39,956
we use API that was

518
00:29:39,956 --> 00:29:41,836
And this is

519
00:29:41,836 --> 00:29:42,826
for ChildViewController.

520
00:29:43,606 --> 00:29:46,396
In order to use this we can

521
00:29:47,236 --> 00:29:49,356
Let's see what an example

522
00:29:50,546 --> 00:29:55,916
First we create a new class,

523
00:29:55,976 --> 00:29:57,736
and we inherit from

524
00:29:58,936 --> 00:30:01,816
We can add a property that has

525
00:29:58,936 --> 00:30:01,816
We can add a property that has

526
00:30:01,816 --> 00:30:03,466
to set in our

527
00:30:03,596 --> 00:30:05,226
And then we can another property

528
00:30:05,226 --> 00:30:08,416
where we actually set the view

529
00:30:08,416 --> 00:30:09,586
to set that style for.

530
00:30:13,576 --> 00:30:16,716
Then we use a

531
00:30:16,716 --> 00:30:19,516
for ChildViewController using

532
00:30:19,516 --> 00:30:23,226
And finally, we use standard

533
00:30:24,446 --> 00:30:26,506
Now, if you wanted

534
00:30:27,166 --> 00:30:29,516
we could vend our

535
00:30:30,206 --> 00:30:33,096
specify the style

536
00:30:33,096 --> 00:30:36,836
on whatever attributes we want,

537
00:30:36,836 --> 00:30:39,426
and then we can present

538
00:30:40,376 --> 00:30:44,866
Next, I'd like to invite Brandon

539
00:30:44,866 --> 00:30:46,746
to update your app for tvOS 10.

540
00:30:48,516 --> 00:31:03,186
[ Applause ]

541
00:30:48,516 --> 00:31:03,186
[ Applause ]

542
00:31:03,686 --> 00:31:04,266
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Marshall.

543
00:31:04,886 --> 00:31:05,606
Hi, everyone.

544
00:31:05,756 --> 00:31:07,466
My name's Brandon,

545
00:31:07,466 --> 00:31:09,706
to show you the tvOS app

546
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:11,936
It's called Fireplaces

547
00:31:12,296 --> 00:31:14,586
And fireplace enthusiasts

548
00:31:15,276 --> 00:31:15,996
Let's take a look.

549
00:31:16,626 --> 00:31:21,256
This app allows to you

550
00:31:21,256 --> 00:31:23,336
from around the world

551
00:31:23,966 --> 00:31:26,606
Let's see what a fireplace

552
00:31:27,756 --> 00:31:30,666
Ahh, doesn't it feel

553
00:31:31,316 --> 00:31:34,796
I think this is great.

554
00:31:34,966 --> 00:31:37,586
Now, even though the simulator

555
00:31:37,666 --> 00:31:39,966
our app is using the light

556
00:31:39,966 --> 00:31:41,636
because we haven't

557
00:31:42,356 --> 00:31:44,326
I'm excited to adopt

558
00:31:44,426 --> 00:31:45,766
so let's go update our app now.

559
00:31:46,736 --> 00:31:52,306
The first thing we need to do is

560
00:31:52,306 --> 00:31:53,836
key to our Info.plist.

561
00:32:01,456 --> 00:32:06,166
We'll set the value to

562
00:32:06,476 --> 00:32:08,796
We chose automatic because

563
00:32:08,796 --> 00:32:10,426
to match the user's

564
00:32:16,116 --> 00:32:18,476
Okay. This is looking

565
00:32:19,166 --> 00:32:21,486
So all of our standard

566
00:32:21,486 --> 00:32:22,656
updated automatically.

567
00:32:22,996 --> 00:32:24,526
So in this case the tab bar

568
00:32:24,526 --> 00:32:26,656
and the wallpaper now

569
00:32:27,256 --> 00:32:29,296
For some of you this

570
00:32:29,296 --> 00:32:30,606
to do to update your apps.

571
00:32:30,896 --> 00:32:33,296
However, our designers

572
00:32:33,296 --> 00:32:36,286
that they want a different logo

573
00:32:36,956 --> 00:32:39,956
And the background color on the

574
00:32:39,956 --> 00:32:40,976
out a little bit too much.

575
00:32:40,976 --> 00:32:42,646
So let's go make those changes.

576
00:32:42,736 --> 00:32:45,896
So let's go to our

577
00:32:47,696 --> 00:32:50,436
And the first thing

578
00:32:50,436 --> 00:32:53,106
because this is an

579
00:32:53,476 --> 00:32:57,606
we need to enable the trait

580
00:32:58,176 --> 00:33:02,146
So to do that, we'll go to

581
00:32:58,176 --> 00:33:02,146
So to do that, we'll go to

582
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:04,096
on this Use Trait

583
00:33:04,976 --> 00:33:06,716
When we do that, we're

584
00:33:06,716 --> 00:33:09,036
that trait variations

585
00:33:09,386 --> 00:33:10,676
with Xcode 8 or later.

586
00:33:10,756 --> 00:33:12,036
And that's fine,

587
00:33:13,756 --> 00:33:16,926
So now we'll click on our logo,

588
00:33:17,506 --> 00:33:19,096
And there's these

589
00:33:19,096 --> 00:33:20,006
to some of the properties.

590
00:33:20,326 --> 00:33:25,116
So we'll click on that and add a

591
00:33:25,116 --> 00:33:26,326
and we'll specify yellow.

592
00:33:27,956 --> 00:33:31,036
Now, one cool feature of Xcode 8

593
00:33:31,036 --> 00:33:33,036
between the light and

594
00:33:33,036 --> 00:33:34,156
within Interface Builder.

595
00:33:34,866 --> 00:33:37,306
To do that we'll go to the

596
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:39,766
and click on this View As:

597
00:33:40,506 --> 00:33:41,796
And we have two options here.

598
00:33:42,286 --> 00:33:43,946
We have light and dark.

599
00:33:44,056 --> 00:33:48,786
When we click dark everything

600
00:33:48,966 --> 00:33:52,116
So our logo changed color

601
00:33:52,476 --> 00:33:54,486
and wallpaper have

602
00:33:55,276 --> 00:33:56,886
So that looks pretty good.

603
00:33:56,886 --> 00:33:58,616
So let's go update

604
00:33:59,276 --> 00:34:04,926
In our AppDelegate we're

605
00:33:59,276 --> 00:34:04,926
In our AppDelegate we're

606
00:34:04,926 --> 00:34:07,176
of our CollectionViewCell

607
00:34:08,016 --> 00:34:09,295
Now, we want the

608
00:34:09,485 --> 00:34:11,406
to change based on

609
00:34:11,485 --> 00:34:13,916
So we need to use a

610
00:34:14,606 --> 00:34:18,456
So first we'll start out by

611
00:34:18,616 --> 00:34:20,746
So let light equals

612
00:34:21,216 --> 00:34:24,726
with a UserInterfaceStyle

613
00:34:26,916 --> 00:34:29,335
Then we'll replace our

614
00:34:29,746 --> 00:34:31,446
with a trait-specific

615
00:34:32,146 --> 00:34:34,235
So for TraitCollection,

616
00:34:34,235 --> 00:34:35,786
in the TraitCollection

617
00:34:36,206 --> 00:34:39,206
We'll do the same for dark

618
00:34:39,505 --> 00:34:41,116
and specify a different

619
00:34:42,396 --> 00:34:43,485
Now, because we can't view this

620
00:34:43,485 --> 00:34:45,356
in Interface Builder,

621
00:34:46,636 --> 00:34:49,166
We've added a keyboard

622
00:34:49,525 --> 00:34:50,936
quickly switch between the light

623
00:34:50,936 --> 00:34:53,416
and dark appearances

624
00:34:54,735 --> 00:34:56,626
To do that, we'll

625
00:34:57,236 --> 00:35:00,096
to switch the light appearance

626
00:34:57,236 --> 00:35:00,096
to switch the light appearance

627
00:35:00,096 --> 00:35:01,636
to switch back to

628
00:35:02,856 --> 00:35:04,416
So that's looking

629
00:35:04,546 --> 00:35:08,456
But I've noticed that the

630
00:35:08,456 --> 00:35:09,806
that we've changed

631
00:35:10,356 --> 00:35:11,986
So let's go update that as well.

632
00:35:13,756 --> 00:35:16,396
So we'll go to our to custom

633
00:35:17,286 --> 00:35:19,686
and before we were

634
00:35:19,766 --> 00:35:21,036
in our awakeFromNib function.

635
00:35:21,946 --> 00:35:23,676
Since we want the

636
00:35:23,676 --> 00:35:25,226
when our TraitCollection change,

637
00:35:25,596 --> 00:35:27,946
we'll override the

638
00:35:28,046 --> 00:35:28,506
function.

639
00:35:30,536 --> 00:35:32,806
We'll use the same

640
00:35:32,806 --> 00:35:34,176
for our light interface style,

641
00:35:34,746 --> 00:35:37,306
and for our dark we'll

642
00:35:38,746 --> 00:35:43,806
Now, TraitCollectionDidChange

643
00:35:43,806 --> 00:35:45,056
added to a view hierarchy.

644
00:35:45,356 --> 00:35:47,486
So we remove our

645
00:35:47,936 --> 00:35:50,026
But for backwards

646
00:35:50,026 --> 00:35:52,626
we'll just leave it in there.

647
00:35:52,836 --> 00:35:59,756
Let's run our app,

648
00:36:00,796 --> 00:36:03,726
Okay. That looks much better.

649
00:36:03,886 --> 00:36:06,056
So let's switch to

650
00:36:06,056 --> 00:36:07,326
make sure nothing has changed.

651
00:36:07,326 --> 00:36:08,586
And that still looks good.

652
00:36:09,116 --> 00:36:09,816
And we'll switch back

653
00:36:09,816 --> 00:36:11,716
to the dark appearance,

654
00:36:12,536 --> 00:36:15,826
So we've just updated our app

655
00:36:16,126 --> 00:36:18,366
and we're ready to

656
00:36:18,886 --> 00:36:21,016
Now I'd like to invite

&gt;&gt; Thank you, Brandon.

659
00:36:28,206 --> 00:36:32,026
That was a very cool

660
00:36:33,766 --> 00:36:36,986
So as you've seen,

661
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:38,706
and dark appearance

So we hope all of you can adopt

of the many features in tvOS.

665
00:36:52,636 --> 00:36:56,686
