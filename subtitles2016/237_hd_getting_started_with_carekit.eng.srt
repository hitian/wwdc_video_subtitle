00:00:36,216 --> 00:00:37,106
Good afternoon everyone.

5
00:00:37,406 --> 00:00:39,526
Welcome to the session

6
00:00:39,756 --> 00:00:41,516
I'm Umer. I'm an engineer

7
00:00:42,716 --> 00:00:45,856
Our agenda will consist of

8
00:00:45,856 --> 00:00:46,686
and how it came about.

9
00:00:47,416 --> 00:00:49,606
Taking a look at an app

10
00:00:49,606 --> 00:00:51,286
to enhance the patient-provider

11
00:00:52,376 --> 00:00:54,396
Working through the CareKit

12
00:00:54,396 --> 00:00:55,146
to create an app here.

13
00:00:56,016 --> 00:00:58,806
Then a demo of an app that uses

14
00:00:59,266 --> 00:01:01,206
And then lastly what's

15
00:00:59,266 --> 00:01:01,206
And then lastly what's

16
00:01:01,206 --> 00:01:03,366
and the developer

17
00:01:03,366 --> 00:01:04,236
to take it to the next level.

18
00:01:06,646 --> 00:01:08,616
So before I talk

19
00:01:08,796 --> 00:01:09,806
let's see where it came from.

20
00:01:12,326 --> 00:01:14,146
Many of you might be

21
00:01:14,676 --> 00:01:16,526
It's a framework that

22
00:01:16,706 --> 00:01:19,316
that enables providers

23
00:01:19,396 --> 00:01:21,136
to create a study

24
00:01:21,136 --> 00:01:22,566
on a large-scale using iPhones.

25
00:01:23,226 --> 00:01:26,656
So if you're interested, I

26
00:01:26,656 --> 00:01:27,906
at the session from

27
00:01:28,076 --> 00:01:30,396
What's New in ResearchKit,

28
00:01:30,396 --> 00:01:30,956
and Yuen Xiou [phonetic].

29
00:01:31,556 --> 00:01:33,176
And the ResearchKit

30
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:35,426
hosted by John Roll [phonetic],

31
00:01:36,216 --> 00:01:40,696
In the past year with

32
00:01:40,696 --> 00:01:42,156
of requests on study

33
00:01:42,646 --> 00:01:43,536
to be able to see the data

34
00:01:43,536 --> 00:01:45,226
that they were providing

35
00:01:45,986 --> 00:01:48,236
This led us to brainstorm

36
00:01:49,176 --> 00:01:52,246
While brainstorming these

37
00:01:52,246 --> 00:01:54,796
for care, expanding beyond the

38
00:01:55,776 --> 00:01:59,026
And therefore from ResearchKit

39
00:01:59,426 --> 00:02:00,006
CareKit.

40
00:01:59,426 --> 00:02:00,006
CareKit.

41
00:02:00,616 --> 00:02:05,786
So CareKit is an open source

42
00:02:05,786 --> 00:02:07,656
to build apps that

43
00:02:07,656 --> 00:02:08,966
to take an active

44
00:02:09,895 --> 00:02:12,226
Now CareKit is great for

45
00:02:13,576 --> 00:02:16,016
So a great example for a chronic

46
00:02:16,626 --> 00:02:18,096
Where medication

47
00:02:18,746 --> 00:02:21,736
Also doing assessments like

48
00:02:21,736 --> 00:02:24,086
to see your progress and

49
00:02:24,086 --> 00:02:25,516
that actually improve

50
00:02:25,786 --> 00:02:27,856
Just stuff that you need

51
00:02:28,216 --> 00:02:29,736
a support group or

52
00:02:30,396 --> 00:02:35,246
And then another good

53
00:02:35,246 --> 00:02:37,236
of the most critical parts

54
00:02:37,336 --> 00:02:37,896
post-surgery.

55
00:02:38,816 --> 00:02:40,146
So let's focus on this use case,

56
00:02:40,246 --> 00:02:42,106
and walk through the current

57
00:02:42,106 --> 00:02:42,966
and provider experience.

58
00:02:46,706 --> 00:02:49,316
So currently, if you leave the

59
00:02:49,316 --> 00:02:50,796
you're given a sheet of

60
00:02:51,356 --> 00:02:53,536
This has everything you need

61
00:02:54,086 --> 00:02:56,256
This sheet of paper has some

62
00:02:56,356 --> 00:02:57,646
with many that change over time.

63
00:02:58,726 --> 00:03:00,866
The compliance to these

64
00:02:58,726 --> 00:03:00,866
The compliance to these

65
00:03:01,196 --> 00:03:03,216
And they typically

66
00:03:04,326 --> 00:03:05,426
These plans are not dynamic,

67
00:03:05,546 --> 00:03:07,876
and therefore they don't change

68
00:03:08,336 --> 00:03:09,686
And ultimately the

69
00:03:09,686 --> 00:03:10,916
to the hospital to be retreated.

70
00:03:11,906 --> 00:03:13,876
Our goal with CareKit

71
00:03:13,876 --> 00:03:16,236
and take something like

72
00:03:16,886 --> 00:03:18,766
and turn it into what

73
00:03:20,016 --> 00:03:21,906
Now this is a Care Card

74
00:03:21,906 --> 00:03:23,176
to see their entire

75
00:03:23,576 --> 00:03:26,136
One that is interactive,

76
00:03:26,466 --> 00:03:28,546
and it provides a great sense

77
00:03:29,936 --> 00:03:32,246
So in the development of

78
00:03:32,246 --> 00:03:33,526
that there's so much

79
00:03:33,526 --> 00:03:34,736
because now we're on an iPhone.

80
00:03:35,376 --> 00:03:37,726
And that let us create

81
00:03:37,726 --> 00:03:38,846
with the patient

82
00:03:41,506 --> 00:03:42,846
The Symptom and Measurement

83
00:03:43,186 --> 00:03:45,276
which records subjective

84
00:03:46,636 --> 00:03:49,456
The insides dashboard, that

85
00:03:49,456 --> 00:03:51,226
in a way that enables

86
00:03:51,226 --> 00:03:52,096
and gaps in their care.

87
00:03:52,096 --> 00:03:55,996
And the connect module

88
00:03:55,996 --> 00:03:58,386
and sharing the data with a

89
00:04:01,276 --> 00:04:02,676
So let's see how

90
00:04:02,746 --> 00:04:04,356
to enhance the patient-provider

91
00:04:04,936 --> 00:04:07,316
Texas Medical Center was one of

92
00:04:07,986 --> 00:04:08,976
They've taken these modules

93
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:11,036
to create a unique

94
00:04:11,366 --> 00:04:12,826
So let's take a look at

95
00:04:14,226 --> 00:04:16,516
At first, you are greeted with

96
00:04:16,516 --> 00:04:18,166
to create an account or log in.

97
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:21,356
Our patient, John Appleseed,

98
00:04:21,356 --> 00:04:23,446
and is set up to use the app.

99
00:04:23,976 --> 00:04:25,846
So John wakes up and

100
00:04:25,846 --> 00:04:27,466
that he needs to weigh himself.

101
00:04:29,086 --> 00:04:31,236
He enters the app

102
00:04:32,786 --> 00:04:34,966
and then he weighs

103
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:37,036
and the value is

104
00:04:37,036 --> 00:04:39,886
And the CareKit app will

105
00:04:40,056 --> 00:04:40,646
using HealthKit.

106
00:04:41,796 --> 00:04:43,356
This is very easy

107
00:04:43,356 --> 00:04:45,396
because CareKit provides

108
00:04:45,396 --> 00:04:45,836
with HealthKit.

109
00:04:48,796 --> 00:04:51,146
After recording his weight,

110
00:04:51,146 --> 00:04:53,016
to see what he needs

111
00:04:53,216 --> 00:04:54,446
what's on his to-do list today.

112
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:56,706
So the Care Card and the Symptom

113
00:04:56,706 --> 00:04:58,086
and Measurement Tracker

114
00:04:58,246 --> 00:04:59,886
is populating its

115
00:04:59,886 --> 00:05:02,266
from the ERM Health System

116
00:04:59,886 --> 00:05:02,266
from the ERM Health System

117
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:06,636
So John doesn't recall

118
00:05:06,636 --> 00:05:07,966
of his activities,

119
00:05:07,966 --> 00:05:09,586
So he can tap into that cell,

120
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:11,826
and he can read the

121
00:05:12,776 --> 00:05:16,536
And then John completes

122
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:18,236
and takes his first

123
00:05:19,846 --> 00:05:24,296
He now taps into

124
00:05:24,336 --> 00:05:26,266
to see what assessments he

125
00:05:26,986 --> 00:05:29,396
In his Symptom and Measurement

126
00:05:29,396 --> 00:05:32,296
that he has some surgical

127
00:05:32,296 --> 00:05:33,336
of what could be an infection.

128
00:05:34,276 --> 00:05:36,486
So first he records

129
00:05:36,816 --> 00:05:37,846
using the scale assessment.

130
00:05:38,556 --> 00:05:44,066
And then he decides to take

131
00:05:44,066 --> 00:05:45,076
and upload it to the app.

132
00:05:45,356 --> 00:05:46,976
And he can do that

133
00:05:46,976 --> 00:05:47,746
and Measurement Tracker,

134
00:05:47,746 --> 00:05:48,976
and this data is

135
00:05:57,076 --> 00:05:58,916
Lastly, he performs a

136
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:01,576
As he is walking around

137
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:01,576
As he is walking around

138
00:06:01,676 --> 00:06:03,996
the sensors on the iPhone are

139
00:06:04,646 --> 00:06:06,596
And once he has completed

140
00:06:06,596 --> 00:06:13,426
the data is transmitted

141
00:06:13,786 --> 00:06:16,036
So John decides to take a look

142
00:06:16,036 --> 00:06:17,786
to see his data for

143
00:06:18,206 --> 00:06:20,106
He can see the tips and

144
00:06:20,716 --> 00:06:23,036
This provides a way for him to

145
00:06:23,036 --> 00:06:23,916
and user-friendly way.

146
00:06:24,946 --> 00:06:26,936
And then he also navigates

147
00:06:27,536 --> 00:06:28,976
to be able to compare his

148
00:06:34,876 --> 00:06:37,396
Meanwhile, he is still worried

149
00:06:37,396 --> 00:06:38,916
that he reported earlier

150
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:41,476
So he decides to send a

151
00:06:42,576 --> 00:06:45,566
He taps to compose a

152
00:06:45,566 --> 00:06:47,346
to email his provider,

153
00:06:48,346 --> 00:06:49,686
In his message, he does not need

154
00:06:49,686 --> 00:06:51,136
to upload the infection

155
00:06:51,136 --> 00:06:53,116
because it's already been

156
00:06:53,116 --> 00:06:53,976
through the infection

157
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:01,876
So then later in the day,

158
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:01,876
So then later in the day,

159
00:07:01,876 --> 00:07:03,626
from his care team

160
00:07:03,676 --> 00:07:06,086
And he can go back into

161
00:07:06,086 --> 00:07:07,486
that the provider

162
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:11,446
And that's how Texas Medical

163
00:07:11,446 --> 00:07:14,916
module, and created an app that

164
00:07:14,916 --> 00:07:16,176
with the patient-provider

165
00:07:17,516 --> 00:07:22,646
[ Applause ]

166
00:07:23,146 --> 00:07:25,156
Thanks. Let's take a

167
00:07:25,156 --> 00:07:26,536
of creating an app

168
00:07:27,886 --> 00:07:29,376
Here are the four

169
00:07:29,716 --> 00:07:30,546
that we've already looked at.

170
00:07:31,296 --> 00:07:33,916
Accompanied by two back-end

171
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:34,976
and the Document Exporter.

172
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:37,866
Now we'll go into each one of

173
00:07:37,866 --> 00:07:38,766
on the Care Plan Store.

174
00:07:40,436 --> 00:07:42,596
The Care Plan Store consists

175
00:07:43,586 --> 00:07:45,926
So let's begin by defining

176
00:07:46,936 --> 00:07:48,856
then creating an activity

177
00:07:49,676 --> 00:07:52,036
exploring the relationship

178
00:07:52,036 --> 00:07:53,326
and then bringing

179
00:07:55,586 --> 00:07:57,126
So if you look at

180
00:07:57,546 --> 00:08:00,306
we can visualize what an

181
00:07:57,546 --> 00:08:00,306
we can visualize what an

182
00:08:01,096 --> 00:08:02,426
Let's focus on the ibuprofen.

183
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:05,666
Where Ibuprofen 200

184
00:08:05,856 --> 00:08:08,376
And the circles underneath

185
00:08:09,176 --> 00:08:12,296
And then activities and

186
00:08:12,296 --> 00:08:13,496
to create the Care Plan Store.

187
00:08:16,426 --> 00:08:17,486
So here's an activity.

188
00:08:17,616 --> 00:08:19,246
Let's go ahead and

189
00:08:19,806 --> 00:08:21,716
You'll first give an identifier,

190
00:08:21,796 --> 00:08:24,136
which we've used

191
00:08:24,656 --> 00:08:26,546
This helps uniquely

192
00:08:26,546 --> 00:08:27,356
in the Care Plan Store.

193
00:08:28,606 --> 00:08:30,396
Then a group identifier to

194
00:08:30,396 --> 00:08:32,556
of certain activities that you

195
00:08:32,556 --> 00:08:32,986
later on.

196
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:35,926
The title is Ibuprofen.

197
00:08:36,135 --> 00:08:37,446
The text is 200 mg.

198
00:08:37,926 --> 00:08:39,515
Now these properties

199
00:08:39,515 --> 00:08:41,756
So be sure they properly

200
00:08:42,515 --> 00:08:46,646
The tint color, which can be

201
00:08:47,116 --> 00:08:48,686
Apart from the tint

202
00:08:48,686 --> 00:08:50,376
there are many other

203
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:51,546
that are available in CareKit

204
00:08:51,586 --> 00:08:53,226
and we'll discuss

205
00:08:54,186 --> 00:08:56,376
Now the two properties

206
00:08:56,376 --> 00:08:57,466
on are type and schedule.

207
00:08:58,456 --> 00:08:59,456
So the type determines

208
00:08:59,526 --> 00:09:01,506
which front-end module

209
00:08:59,526 --> 00:09:01,506
which front-end module

210
00:09:01,986 --> 00:09:04,416
So for example, we

211
00:09:04,556 --> 00:09:05,666
which belong on the Care Card.

212
00:09:06,486 --> 00:09:08,416
And we have assessments,

213
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:09,156
and Measurement Tracker.

214
00:09:09,606 --> 00:09:13,116
So because we're creating

215
00:09:13,116 --> 00:09:14,196
it belongs in the Care Card.

216
00:09:14,426 --> 00:09:16,026
Therefore, the activity

217
00:09:16,596 --> 00:09:20,206
Next, I want to focus

218
00:09:20,676 --> 00:09:22,966
The schedule determines

219
00:09:22,966 --> 00:09:24,426
and when this activity

220
00:09:25,746 --> 00:09:26,936
So there are three

221
00:09:26,936 --> 00:09:28,826
to specify the days

222
00:09:28,826 --> 00:09:31,616
You can use a daily

223
00:09:31,796 --> 00:09:33,146
or you can create your

224
00:09:33,246 --> 00:09:35,386
And then you can

225
00:09:35,386 --> 00:09:37,706
to indicate how many times per

226
00:09:37,706 --> 00:09:40,256
Now this sounds a

227
00:09:40,256 --> 00:09:41,066
but it's really not.

228
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:41,976
So let's simplify it.

229
00:09:41,976 --> 00:09:44,836
Let's go ahead and define a

230
00:09:46,946 --> 00:09:47,986
Well here's a weekly schedule.

231
00:09:47,986 --> 00:09:50,216
And we'll say we want the

232
00:09:50,216 --> 00:09:52,296
on Monday, Wednesday,

233
00:09:52,296 --> 00:09:56,496
And then we can use a frequency

234
00:09:56,826 --> 00:09:58,576
twice on Wednesday, and

235
00:09:59,526 --> 00:10:02,596
And then combined together

236
00:09:59,526 --> 00:10:02,596
And then combined together

237
00:10:02,596 --> 00:10:03,326
for this activity.

238
00:10:04,096 --> 00:10:06,896
And now we have a complete

239
00:10:06,896 --> 00:10:07,746
to the Care Plan Store.

240
00:10:09,046 --> 00:10:10,356
So before we look

241
00:10:10,356 --> 00:10:12,346
to create the Care Plan Store

242
00:10:12,396 --> 00:10:14,916
let's just discuss what an

243
00:10:15,676 --> 00:10:17,186
So an event is an object

244
00:10:17,236 --> 00:10:19,216
that a developer never

245
00:10:19,526 --> 00:10:20,646
In fact, it's created

246
00:10:20,646 --> 00:10:21,476
by the Care Plan Store.

247
00:10:22,366 --> 00:10:24,736
So to understand how these

248
00:10:24,736 --> 00:10:26,066
to the schedule object

249
00:10:26,986 --> 00:10:29,166
A schedule object

250
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:30,476
on the frequency you specify.

251
00:10:30,586 --> 00:10:35,006
So for example, here, we

252
00:10:35,326 --> 00:10:36,906
Therefore, we've got four

253
00:10:37,196 --> 00:10:38,976
And then we have two

254
00:10:38,976 --> 00:10:40,366
so you've got two for June 22nd.

255
00:10:40,366 --> 00:10:42,016
And then it'll keep

256
00:10:42,546 --> 00:10:44,786
So the way you can stop the

257
00:10:44,786 --> 00:10:46,056
is by specifying an end date.

258
00:10:46,196 --> 00:10:47,936
Once you specify an end

259
00:10:47,936 --> 00:10:49,836
the Care Plan Store will

260
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:53,876
So even though a developer

261
00:10:53,876 --> 00:10:55,396
it provides a lot of

262
00:10:56,036 --> 00:10:58,146
From an event object you can

263
00:10:58,776 --> 00:11:01,086
You can see what state it is

264
00:10:58,776 --> 00:11:01,086
You can see what state it is

265
00:11:01,086 --> 00:11:02,396
which means the user

266
00:11:02,396 --> 00:11:04,396
It could be completed

267
00:11:05,316 --> 00:11:08,206
The results object contains

268
00:11:08,206 --> 00:11:10,366
As things such as

269
00:11:10,366 --> 00:11:12,306
and any other information you

270
00:11:13,046 --> 00:11:14,806
And then there's also a

271
00:11:14,806 --> 00:11:16,606
that this event came out of.

272
00:11:17,556 --> 00:11:20,056
So activities generate

273
00:11:20,376 --> 00:11:23,096
and combined together they

274
00:11:23,096 --> 00:11:23,736
a Care Plan Store.

275
00:11:24,096 --> 00:11:25,296
So let's take a look

276
00:11:27,016 --> 00:11:28,726
So now to create

277
00:11:28,726 --> 00:11:29,686
it's very straight forward.

278
00:11:29,686 --> 00:11:30,696
You just define a variable,

279
00:11:30,696 --> 00:11:32,356
which I have here

280
00:11:32,356 --> 00:11:34,436
of type OCKCarePlanStore.

281
00:11:35,516 --> 00:11:37,576
Then you have to define a

282
00:11:37,676 --> 00:11:39,456
Which in this case

283
00:11:39,456 --> 00:11:40,376
to documents directory.

284
00:11:41,096 --> 00:11:44,436
And then you just initialize

285
00:11:44,486 --> 00:11:46,646
and you have a Care

286
00:11:48,696 --> 00:11:51,226
So now, let's go ahead and

287
00:11:51,226 --> 00:11:52,156
that we just created.

288
00:11:52,626 --> 00:11:54,046
First you will create

289
00:11:54,116 --> 00:11:55,706
So you have a start

290
00:11:55,706 --> 00:11:56,706
as the beginning of this year.

291
00:11:57,306 --> 00:11:59,596
And then using a weekly

292
00:11:59,596 --> 00:12:02,696
for occurrences on each day to

293
00:11:59,596 --> 00:12:02,696
for occurrences on each day to

294
00:12:03,046 --> 00:12:04,906
So for example, our

295
00:12:04,906 --> 00:12:08,596
So zero on Sunday, four on

296
00:12:08,596 --> 00:12:10,126
And then so on and so forth.

297
00:12:10,816 --> 00:12:13,856
So once you have that

298
00:12:13,856 --> 00:12:15,376
and initialize the

299
00:12:16,056 --> 00:12:17,766
You give it the identifier,

300
00:12:17,816 --> 00:12:19,286
All the other parameters

301
00:12:19,636 --> 00:12:21,396
There's two here that we

302
00:12:21,396 --> 00:12:22,956
which is instructions

303
00:12:22,956 --> 00:12:24,106
So these are shown

304
00:12:24,106 --> 00:12:25,416
on the detailed [inaudible]

305
00:12:25,806 --> 00:12:28,566
For example, when John

306
00:12:28,566 --> 00:12:30,176
he could see additional

307
00:12:30,596 --> 00:12:33,266
So we'll have additional

308
00:12:33,266 --> 00:12:35,236
with an image, and we'll

309
00:12:35,236 --> 00:12:36,136
when we look at the Care Card.

310
00:12:36,386 --> 00:12:39,946
And then to add this activity

311
00:12:39,946 --> 00:12:42,116
we just call the add method

312
00:12:42,146 --> 00:12:43,686
created, and then use

313
00:12:43,686 --> 00:12:47,676
for any error checking

314
00:12:47,956 --> 00:12:49,226
That's how you create

315
00:12:49,276 --> 00:12:50,766
and that's how you

316
00:12:51,366 --> 00:12:53,396
Let's see how we can use

317
00:12:53,396 --> 00:12:54,276
onto the Care Card now.

318
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:57,326
Creating the Care Plan Store

319
00:12:57,326 --> 00:12:58,726
and adding an activity

320
00:12:58,876 --> 00:13:00,896
Showing it on the Care Card

321
00:12:58,876 --> 00:13:00,896
Showing it on the Care Card

322
00:13:00,896 --> 00:13:01,516
and straightforward.

323
00:13:01,566 --> 00:13:04,946
I'm going to show you the

324
00:13:05,516 --> 00:13:07,996
Emphasize the type property

325
00:13:08,336 --> 00:13:09,636
So because you set intervention,

326
00:13:09,636 --> 00:13:10,856
the Care PlanS tore

327
00:13:10,856 --> 00:13:11,866
to show it on the Care Card.

328
00:13:11,866 --> 00:13:14,816
And then to actually

329
00:13:14,816 --> 00:13:16,526
you just initialize the

330
00:13:16,576 --> 00:13:17,846
with a carePlanStore object.

331
00:13:19,086 --> 00:13:20,896
You embed it inside a

332
00:13:21,016 --> 00:13:22,436
The reason this is necessary is

333
00:13:22,436 --> 00:13:24,896
because we provide some

334
00:13:24,896 --> 00:13:27,426
with calendar navigation as

335
00:13:27,426 --> 00:13:29,236
onto the navigation stack.

336
00:13:29,306 --> 00:13:32,736
And then you just present

337
00:13:32,736 --> 00:13:33,686
into a tab bar controller.

338
00:13:33,686 --> 00:13:35,386
And with these three

339
00:13:35,386 --> 00:13:37,006
you get what we have

340
00:13:38,516 --> 00:13:44,626
[ Applause ]

341
00:13:45,126 --> 00:13:47,596
So as you can see here, we have

342
00:13:47,596 --> 00:13:49,046
with some other ones

343
00:13:49,956 --> 00:13:52,186
And then let's look at the

344
00:13:52,186 --> 00:13:53,286
to understand what

345
00:13:54,316 --> 00:13:56,566
So the header view shows you

346
00:13:56,876 --> 00:13:58,956
You can slide left and right

347
00:13:59,476 --> 00:14:01,826
You can select a specific date

348
00:13:59,476 --> 00:14:01,826
You can select a specific date

349
00:14:02,486 --> 00:14:04,706
The heart completion here

350
00:14:04,706 --> 00:14:06,206
and updated based

351
00:14:06,206 --> 00:14:07,046
in the Care Plan Store.

352
00:14:08,216 --> 00:14:10,526
So the heart and the fill

353
00:14:10,886 --> 00:14:12,106
You can specify a

354
00:14:12,146 --> 00:14:13,706
that might suit your

355
00:14:13,756 --> 00:14:15,316
And then the fill

356
00:14:15,316 --> 00:14:16,436
to match the custom image.

357
00:14:16,836 --> 00:14:18,236
And we'll see an

358
00:14:18,236 --> 00:14:19,976
that has this customization

359
00:14:22,496 --> 00:14:24,116
Now below the header

360
00:14:24,116 --> 00:14:26,176
This shows all the interventions

361
00:14:26,176 --> 00:14:27,166
to complete for that day.

362
00:14:27,846 --> 00:14:30,086
So any time you add

363
00:14:30,086 --> 00:14:32,906
from the Care Plan Store, this

364
00:14:32,976 --> 00:14:35,606
with no additional work

365
00:14:37,906 --> 00:14:40,076
So here's ibuprofen

366
00:14:40,646 --> 00:14:42,576
And if you tap on the

367
00:14:42,576 --> 00:14:45,366
into the detail view which

368
00:14:45,716 --> 00:14:47,256
as well as an image

369
00:14:47,256 --> 00:14:49,166
so that the user does not

370
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:49,916
that they might be taking.

371
00:14:54,046 --> 00:14:55,586
Now let's take a look at

372
00:14:56,286 --> 00:14:58,656
So this one here asks the user

373
00:14:59,236 --> 00:15:01,116
So while this is something

374
00:14:59,236 --> 00:15:01,116
So while this is something

375
00:15:01,116 --> 00:15:02,306
by just tapping into the cell,

376
00:15:03,106 --> 00:15:06,056
it can also be updated

377
00:15:06,056 --> 00:15:06,796
on the Apple Watch.

378
00:15:07,776 --> 00:15:09,336
So that brings me

379
00:15:09,336 --> 00:15:10,866
is how can we update

380
00:15:12,016 --> 00:15:12,856
Well there's different ways.

381
00:15:13,176 --> 00:15:14,926
One of which, like we

382
00:15:14,926 --> 00:15:16,206
such as medication tracking

383
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:17,966
where they can report they've

384
00:15:18,896 --> 00:15:20,006
They can be marked completed

385
00:15:20,006 --> 00:15:21,776
after the user has

386
00:15:21,906 --> 00:15:23,606
Such as an active

387
00:15:24,636 --> 00:15:26,716
Or it can be updated

388
00:15:27,106 --> 00:15:29,086
from device sensors

389
00:15:29,086 --> 00:15:30,456
and the iPhone using HealthKit.

390
00:15:31,256 --> 00:15:33,656
So that's the Care Card.

391
00:15:34,046 --> 00:15:35,456
It's an interactive

392
00:15:35,456 --> 00:15:38,106
that uses the Care Plan Store to

393
00:15:38,106 --> 00:15:40,036
and provide the user

394
00:15:40,036 --> 00:15:40,806
on their day-to-day health.

395
00:15:43,236 --> 00:15:45,386
So just like the Care

396
00:15:45,386 --> 00:15:47,826
and Measurement Tracker also

397
00:15:47,986 --> 00:15:50,066
to record a subjective and

398
00:15:50,446 --> 00:15:54,116
So the process of adding an

399
00:15:54,116 --> 00:15:57,276
to how we did in the

400
00:15:57,706 --> 00:16:00,486
So let's say that we have

401
00:15:57,706 --> 00:16:00,486
So let's say that we have

402
00:16:00,486 --> 00:16:01,656
to create for your lower back.

403
00:16:02,446 --> 00:16:04,756
The code here is nearly

404
00:16:04,816 --> 00:16:06,266
so we'll assume that

405
00:16:06,266 --> 00:16:07,096
to the Care Plan Store.

406
00:16:08,236 --> 00:16:10,346
Now let's take a look at how

407
00:16:10,346 --> 00:16:11,706
to actually show

408
00:16:12,606 --> 00:16:14,706
Just like the Care Card, you

409
00:16:14,706 --> 00:16:16,816
with your controller with

410
00:16:17,496 --> 00:16:18,836
There's a delegate

411
00:16:18,836 --> 00:16:19,866
but I'll get to that shortly.

412
00:16:19,866 --> 00:16:22,746
And then embed it into

413
00:16:22,886 --> 00:16:25,466
And then again, just present it

414
00:16:27,016 --> 00:16:28,386
So if we dissect this UI,

415
00:16:29,596 --> 00:16:31,986
the header view contains

416
00:16:31,986 --> 00:16:33,546
as the Care Card where

417
00:16:33,546 --> 00:16:34,506
and right to change weeks.

418
00:16:34,816 --> 00:16:36,976
We select specific days to

419
00:16:37,706 --> 00:16:39,596
As you're working on the

420
00:16:39,696 --> 00:16:42,076
the ring -- there will be a ring

421
00:16:42,276 --> 00:16:44,536
And once you've completed them,

422
00:16:44,626 --> 00:16:46,786
to know that you have no more

423
00:16:47,376 --> 00:16:50,156
The color for the ring and the

424
00:16:50,156 --> 00:16:51,406
to suit your app.

425
00:16:52,116 --> 00:16:54,796
Underneath here, you will have

426
00:16:54,796 --> 00:16:55,656
to be completed for the day.

427
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:57,566
Now there can be a

428
00:16:57,616 --> 00:16:58,696
so let's take a look

429
00:16:59,786 --> 00:17:00,746
Here we have a pain survey.

430
00:16:59,786 --> 00:17:00,746
Here we have a pain survey.

431
00:17:00,866 --> 00:17:03,436
For this you can use the

432
00:17:03,436 --> 00:17:04,896
to present a beautifully

433
00:17:05,435 --> 00:17:07,496
They can be an active task.

434
00:17:08,006 --> 00:17:09,556
So you could launch

435
00:17:09,556 --> 00:17:11,576
or create a custom active

436
00:17:11,646 --> 00:17:12,826
such as the range of motion one.

437
00:17:14,465 --> 00:17:15,486
It can be self-reported.

438
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:18,246
So you can present a view

439
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:20,636
in the Texas Medical Center

440
00:17:20,636 --> 00:17:22,566
to take a photo of the

441
00:17:23,326 --> 00:17:24,965
And then it could be any data

442
00:17:24,965 --> 00:17:26,256
from a HealthKit or

443
00:17:26,586 --> 00:17:28,465
So in the Texas Medical

444
00:17:28,566 --> 00:17:30,366
John jumped onto

445
00:17:30,436 --> 00:17:32,826
and it automatically updated

446
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:36,046
So that's where the

447
00:17:36,086 --> 00:17:37,826
In order to present the

448
00:17:37,826 --> 00:17:39,516
you have to implement the

449
00:17:39,916 --> 00:17:41,276
which provides a callback

450
00:17:41,276 --> 00:17:43,686
for the developer whenever the

451
00:17:44,286 --> 00:17:46,056
In this call back, you're

452
00:17:46,116 --> 00:17:46,896
that they want to launch.

453
00:17:47,206 --> 00:17:48,776
And then you can determine

454
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:52,786
to present appropriately

455
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:54,766
Once you've presented

456
00:17:54,766 --> 00:17:56,616
let's say a pain survey,

457
00:17:56,616 --> 00:17:58,896
and use the data from that

458
00:17:59,676 --> 00:18:04,576
then you create a result object,

459
00:17:59,676 --> 00:18:04,576
then you create a result object,

460
00:18:04,766 --> 00:18:07,866
an optional unit strength, and

461
00:18:07,866 --> 00:18:10,316
for all the -- any additional

462
00:18:11,096 --> 00:18:13,306
And then you just update the

463
00:18:13,656 --> 00:18:15,966
the result object, the state

464
00:18:16,046 --> 00:18:17,946
and then use the completion

465
00:18:18,506 --> 00:18:23,496
And all that combined gives you

466
00:18:23,496 --> 00:18:23,976
and Measurement Tracker.

467
00:18:24,516 --> 00:18:29,856
[ Applause ]

468
00:18:30,356 --> 00:18:32,496
The Insights Dashboard can use

469
00:18:32,496 --> 00:18:33,956
to generate messages and charts.

470
00:18:34,336 --> 00:18:36,696
And this allows the user to

471
00:18:36,696 --> 00:18:37,696
that they're actually

472
00:18:38,276 --> 00:18:42,166
So for us to make this easy

473
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:43,586
we've created what we

474
00:18:43,796 --> 00:18:45,876
You can plug and play those

475
00:18:46,326 --> 00:18:48,966
And these also can include

476
00:18:49,606 --> 00:18:51,876
And they can also be charts

477
00:18:51,876 --> 00:18:54,456
that we introduced in CareKit,

478
00:18:54,456 --> 00:18:55,496
So for example the charts

479
00:18:55,496 --> 00:18:57,746
from ResearchKit can

480
00:18:57,826 --> 00:18:58,806
into our chart object.

481
00:18:58,806 --> 00:19:03,036
So let's take a look at the

482
00:18:58,806 --> 00:19:03,036
So let's take a look at the

483
00:19:04,486 --> 00:19:06,636
This is a medication

484
00:19:06,946 --> 00:19:09,436
Message items help motivate

485
00:19:09,476 --> 00:19:11,486
by surfacing valuable

486
00:19:12,246 --> 00:19:14,326
This message item is using

487
00:19:14,436 --> 00:19:16,746
to calculate the adherence for

488
00:19:17,506 --> 00:19:19,846
These messages can also be

489
00:19:19,846 --> 00:19:21,356
and then passed into

490
00:19:21,576 --> 00:19:25,746
So let's look at the code on how

491
00:19:26,446 --> 00:19:28,916
Here you can specify start

492
00:19:29,406 --> 00:19:31,606
So I've used the beginning

493
00:19:31,606 --> 00:19:33,186
and the end of last

494
00:19:33,186 --> 00:19:34,096
as a start and end date.

495
00:19:34,546 --> 00:19:37,296
Then we can call the

496
00:19:37,436 --> 00:19:39,676
on the Care Plan Store,

497
00:19:39,676 --> 00:19:42,506
to enumerate on, the dates

498
00:19:42,506 --> 00:19:45,526
and to, and then in the handler

499
00:19:45,526 --> 00:19:46,856
in the store for that activity.

500
00:19:47,496 --> 00:19:49,316
And then we can enumerate

501
00:19:49,316 --> 00:19:50,646
to check their state

502
00:19:50,646 --> 00:19:52,976
if they've been completed or

503
00:19:53,546 --> 00:19:57,956
So let's say we calculated

504
00:19:57,956 --> 00:19:59,426
and we want to go ahead

505
00:20:00,396 --> 00:20:02,866
Here you will want to take the

506
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:04,776
and turn it into a

507
00:20:04,776 --> 00:20:06,176
So that it's easier

508
00:20:06,176 --> 00:20:07,576
and actually gain

509
00:20:08,956 --> 00:20:09,656
And then you just create --

510
00:20:09,656 --> 00:20:12,476
initialize a message item with

511
00:20:12,476 --> 00:20:14,906
like to show, a color,

512
00:20:14,906 --> 00:20:15,976
For example, this one's a tip.

513
00:20:20,406 --> 00:20:22,366
Next we have a group bar

514
00:20:22,366 --> 00:20:24,186
to present multi-series

515
00:20:24,836 --> 00:20:26,696
For example, in this

516
00:20:26,696 --> 00:20:29,246
and ibuprofen mapped together

517
00:20:29,246 --> 00:20:31,336
in a way that allows

518
00:20:31,336 --> 00:20:32,776
and gaps in their care.

519
00:20:35,116 --> 00:20:37,336
So here I've defined a

520
00:20:37,516 --> 00:20:39,166
It's of type OCK insight ttem.

521
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:42,036
A barChartItem consists

522
00:20:42,306 --> 00:20:44,236
In the one we just saw

523
00:20:44,236 --> 00:20:45,266
and an ibuprofen series.

524
00:20:45,826 --> 00:20:46,966
So in order to create

525
00:20:46,966 --> 00:20:48,136
we will define a pain series

526
00:20:48,136 --> 00:20:50,056
by initializing a bar

527
00:20:50,476 --> 00:20:52,666
And an array of numeric

528
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:54,416
of string values,

529
00:20:55,786 --> 00:20:56,536
Now the number of items

530
00:20:56,536 --> 00:20:58,336
in the array are not

531
00:20:58,616 --> 00:21:00,856
So your chart can show

532
00:20:58,616 --> 00:21:00,856
So your chart can show

533
00:21:00,856 --> 00:21:02,106
or any number of data points.

534
00:21:03,046 --> 00:21:05,506
The array of numeric values is

535
00:21:05,506 --> 00:21:05,966
on the chart.

536
00:21:06,316 --> 00:21:08,536
And the array of string values

537
00:21:09,376 --> 00:21:10,666
Oftentimes these

538
00:21:11,136 --> 00:21:12,986
For example, in the

539
00:21:13,056 --> 00:21:15,056
the numeric values determine

540
00:21:15,396 --> 00:21:16,796
but they don't represent

541
00:21:17,226 --> 00:21:19,286
For example, the 1-5-4 and so on

542
00:21:19,286 --> 00:21:21,446
and so forth can

543
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:23,796
to mean one tablet, five

544
00:21:24,226 --> 00:21:26,636
Therefore, the value

545
00:21:26,636 --> 00:21:28,536
that their medication is

546
00:21:28,806 --> 00:21:30,106
50 percent, and 40 percent.

547
00:21:30,836 --> 00:21:33,516
So now that we have the

548
00:21:33,516 --> 00:21:35,476
we're going to go ahead and

549
00:21:36,296 --> 00:21:38,446
Give it a title, a

550
00:21:38,446 --> 00:21:41,406
And we've got two arrays for

551
00:21:41,406 --> 00:21:42,886
that show up to the

552
00:21:42,886 --> 00:21:45,276
And then you can specify

553
00:21:45,276 --> 00:21:45,796
like to show.

554
00:21:45,886 --> 00:21:47,466
This could be one, two, or ten.

555
00:21:48,456 --> 00:21:49,876
Now there are two

556
00:21:49,876 --> 00:21:50,576
which is the scale.

557
00:21:50,576 --> 00:21:52,886
The minimum scale range and

558
00:21:53,006 --> 00:21:55,556
If you don't specify these, we

559
00:21:55,556 --> 00:21:56,526
on the data you've given us.

560
00:21:57,196 --> 00:21:59,626
But if you do, then be mindful

561
00:21:59,626 --> 00:22:01,036
so that the data

562
00:21:59,626 --> 00:22:01,036
so that the data

563
00:22:01,686 --> 00:22:03,876
For example, if you have data

564
00:22:03,876 --> 00:22:06,706
to ten, and you specify a

565
00:22:06,706 --> 00:22:08,726
then all the points that are

566
00:22:08,726 --> 00:22:09,246
to the user.

567
00:22:09,446 --> 00:22:13,046
And it will make the

568
00:22:13,556 --> 00:22:15,696
So we have a message

569
00:22:15,696 --> 00:22:16,756
And we have a chart item.

570
00:22:16,756 --> 00:22:18,716
Let's go ahead and create

571
00:22:19,066 --> 00:22:20,566
You initialize the

572
00:22:20,566 --> 00:22:21,836
with an array of

573
00:22:22,186 --> 00:22:24,156
Give it an optional

574
00:22:24,566 --> 00:22:25,586
A title and a subtitle.

575
00:22:26,166 --> 00:22:28,236
And then you just present it,

576
00:22:29,516 --> 00:22:34,816
[ Applause ]

577
00:22:35,316 --> 00:22:36,746
And that's how you

578
00:22:37,596 --> 00:22:39,716
So the next one is Connect.

579
00:22:40,586 --> 00:22:42,356
Connect allows you to

580
00:22:42,356 --> 00:22:43,806
with your care team and

581
00:22:45,326 --> 00:22:47,346
So to make this easy as well,

582
00:22:47,636 --> 00:22:49,426
we've created what we

583
00:22:49,426 --> 00:22:50,556
And there are two types here.

584
00:22:51,476 --> 00:22:53,546
We've got a care team contact,

585
00:22:54,356 --> 00:22:56,256
or any other care team member.

586
00:22:56,316 --> 00:22:57,846
And then we have a

587
00:22:57,846 --> 00:22:59,606
which could be a close

588
00:23:00,486 --> 00:23:01,826
So if we look at

589
00:23:01,826 --> 00:23:03,136
these show up grouped

590
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:06,266
Here we have the care

591
00:23:06,846 --> 00:23:08,506
And then down below we have

592
00:23:09,306 --> 00:23:11,036
So let's look at the code

593
00:23:13,226 --> 00:23:15,256
To create a physician

594
00:23:15,256 --> 00:23:17,306
PhysicianContact of

595
00:23:17,306 --> 00:23:20,426
And then you just initialize the

596
00:23:20,426 --> 00:23:23,736
which is careTeam, the name,

597
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:26,896
to this contact, the tint color,

598
00:23:26,896 --> 00:23:28,886
and message number, which

599
00:23:28,956 --> 00:23:30,006
for formatting purposes.

600
00:23:30,976 --> 00:23:33,576
The email address is just a

601
00:23:33,576 --> 00:23:35,666
to be shown if there's

602
00:23:35,666 --> 00:23:37,376
to specify what the physician

603
00:23:37,376 --> 00:23:40,146
or the care team

604
00:23:41,226 --> 00:23:42,676
Once you've created

605
00:23:42,676 --> 00:23:45,126
you just initialize the connect

606
00:23:45,126 --> 00:23:47,056
of all the contacts, and

607
00:23:47,596 --> 00:23:49,726
But there's also a delegate

608
00:23:49,726 --> 00:23:52,056
which we'll get to

609
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:53,936
And before we can present

610
00:23:53,936 --> 00:23:55,846
in a navigation controller,

611
00:23:55,846 --> 00:23:57,286
and detail views for

612
00:23:59,256 --> 00:24:01,296
So you will get a Connect

613
00:23:59,256 --> 00:24:01,296
So you will get a Connect

614
00:24:01,336 --> 00:24:02,436
with the Connect

615
00:24:03,496 --> 00:24:05,726
Now if we focus in on the

616
00:24:05,726 --> 00:24:06,666
Dr. Paul Cashman.

617
00:24:07,176 --> 00:24:09,726
If we tap into the cell, it will

618
00:24:09,726 --> 00:24:11,096
where you get a contact

619
00:24:11,906 --> 00:24:14,506
In this contact card, you see

620
00:24:14,506 --> 00:24:17,116
up top here, which shows you

621
00:24:17,586 --> 00:24:19,286
Text message him, or

622
00:24:19,766 --> 00:24:22,656
And then down below is

623
00:24:22,656 --> 00:24:23,656
and send your reports with him.

624
00:24:24,356 --> 00:24:26,246
Now this is where the

625
00:24:27,596 --> 00:24:30,696
The connect delegate

626
00:24:30,696 --> 00:24:31,406
with this contact.

627
00:24:31,716 --> 00:24:34,016
So for example, when the

628
00:24:34,496 --> 00:24:35,626
this method is called.

629
00:24:35,626 --> 00:24:37,696
And then you are given

630
00:24:37,696 --> 00:24:39,616
from which you can determine

631
00:24:39,616 --> 00:24:42,216
to generate and then you can

632
00:24:43,176 --> 00:24:44,796
Now this part is

633
00:24:44,796 --> 00:24:46,256
To create the report

634
00:24:46,696 --> 00:24:48,846
So let's see what we can

635
00:24:49,916 --> 00:24:52,016
So to make the connect

636
00:24:52,086 --> 00:24:54,546
to make it easy to share

637
00:24:54,546 --> 00:24:55,986
we've created the

638
00:24:56,206 --> 00:24:58,106
which works hand-in-hand

639
00:24:58,666 --> 00:25:00,526
The document exporter

640
00:24:58,666 --> 00:25:00,526
The document exporter

641
00:25:00,526 --> 00:25:01,536
from the Care Plan Store.

642
00:25:01,536 --> 00:25:05,056
And even other sources to create

643
00:25:06,726 --> 00:25:08,666
And just like everything

644
00:25:08,666 --> 00:25:11,256
to make this easy, we've created

645
00:25:12,026 --> 00:25:13,166
You've got headers and footers.

646
00:25:13,326 --> 00:25:19,286
We've got texts and paragraphs,

647
00:25:19,396 --> 00:25:21,386
And then combining

648
00:25:21,386 --> 00:25:23,976
you can create a rich

649
00:25:24,516 --> 00:25:30,106
[ Applause ]

650
00:25:30,606 --> 00:25:32,676
So as we can see in this

651
00:25:32,676 --> 00:25:35,456
of the patient, a user friendly

652
00:25:35,956 --> 00:25:37,456
and now the same chart

653
00:25:37,456 --> 00:25:39,376
at in their Insights

654
00:25:39,376 --> 00:25:41,326
by their provider, so that

655
00:25:41,326 --> 00:25:42,436
and gaps in their care.

656
00:25:43,116 --> 00:25:44,486
I know there's a

657
00:25:44,486 --> 00:25:46,076
out all the subjective

658
00:25:46,076 --> 00:25:47,516
for these patients

659
00:25:48,376 --> 00:25:50,076
So let's take a look at

660
00:25:50,686 --> 00:25:52,996
We have a

661
00:25:52,996 --> 00:25:54,116
which is just text content.

662
00:25:54,306 --> 00:25:55,616
This text content can also come

663
00:25:55,616 --> 00:25:57,626
from the Care Plan Store

664
00:25:59,096 --> 00:26:01,396
Then we have a document

665
00:25:59,096 --> 00:26:01,396
Then we have a document

666
00:26:01,546 --> 00:26:04,076
which basically accepts the same

667
00:26:04,076 --> 00:26:05,126
in the Insights Dashboard.

668
00:26:05,326 --> 00:26:06,906
So there's no need

669
00:26:06,906 --> 00:26:08,136
or new chart generation here.

670
00:26:09,346 --> 00:26:12,376
Then we have a table here which

671
00:26:12,766 --> 00:26:16,496
And an array of arrays, in

672
00:26:16,496 --> 00:26:17,566
of the data you want to show.

673
00:26:17,886 --> 00:26:19,836
For example, a weekly

674
00:26:19,836 --> 00:26:22,416
or a weekly data of

675
00:26:23,056 --> 00:26:25,116
Then once you have all the

676
00:26:25,116 --> 00:26:27,206
to use in the document, you

677
00:26:27,576 --> 00:26:28,236
Give it a title.

678
00:26:28,296 --> 00:26:30,526
And then give it an array

679
00:26:30,966 --> 00:26:33,226
And then turning

680
00:26:33,226 --> 00:26:34,796
into a PDF is really

681
00:26:34,796 --> 00:26:36,556
You just call the

682
00:26:36,966 --> 00:26:39,366
Use the NSData that's returned

683
00:26:39,366 --> 00:26:40,536
and write it to a file URL.

684
00:26:40,536 --> 00:26:46,046
So now when the user taps the

685
00:26:46,046 --> 00:26:48,496
and generate the PDF using

686
00:26:48,496 --> 00:26:51,436
created, present it

687
00:26:51,536 --> 00:26:54,526
so they know what they're about

688
00:26:54,526 --> 00:26:56,536
on the share button and then

689
00:26:56,706 --> 00:26:58,696
to share this PDF with others

690
00:26:59,506 --> 00:27:02,726
And that's how the Document

691
00:26:59,506 --> 00:27:02,726
And that's how the Document

692
00:27:02,726 --> 00:27:04,626
with the Connect Module

693
00:27:06,516 --> 00:27:11,366
[ Applause ]

694
00:27:11,866 --> 00:27:13,266
So all these modules

695
00:27:13,316 --> 00:27:14,586
and form the CareKit framework.

696
00:27:15,436 --> 00:27:17,656
So Patient PAL recently

697
00:27:17,656 --> 00:27:18,996
care experience using CareKit.

698
00:27:18,996 --> 00:27:21,576
And I want to show you how

699
00:27:21,766 --> 00:27:23,056
to match their user experience

700
00:27:23,326 --> 00:27:24,926
and they've created

701
00:27:24,926 --> 00:27:26,296
to help their patients

702
00:27:27,836 --> 00:27:29,596
So their Care Card

703
00:27:29,596 --> 00:27:31,286
with a custom image

704
00:27:31,866 --> 00:27:34,096
Their app is focused on

705
00:27:34,096 --> 00:27:35,766
to perform certain

706
00:27:37,096 --> 00:27:39,506
For example, if you focus on

707
00:27:39,716 --> 00:27:41,756
the pink one down

708
00:27:41,756 --> 00:27:43,196
on the remaining

709
00:27:43,806 --> 00:27:45,406
But before it can be

710
00:27:45,486 --> 00:27:46,866
we have to perform

711
00:27:47,776 --> 00:27:51,106
In this exercise task,

712
00:27:51,106 --> 00:27:53,606
of the exercise along with a

713
00:27:53,606 --> 00:27:55,396
to make sure they're performing

714
00:27:56,186 --> 00:27:57,696
What's even nicer is

715
00:27:57,696 --> 00:28:00,066
to record yourself while

716
00:27:57,696 --> 00:28:00,066
to record yourself while

717
00:28:00,066 --> 00:28:01,566
so that the care provider

718
00:28:01,666 --> 00:28:04,546
When you tap the

719
00:28:04,546 --> 00:28:05,936
it shows it embedded

720
00:28:06,366 --> 00:28:08,016
And once you feel like you've

721
00:28:08,056 --> 00:28:09,946
you can tap Get Started

722
00:28:10,206 --> 00:28:11,766
And then there's an

723
00:28:11,766 --> 00:28:12,846
through each set and each rep.

724
00:28:14,646 --> 00:28:15,956
Once you've completed

725
00:28:15,956 --> 00:28:17,816
you can see under Care

726
00:28:17,816 --> 00:28:18,636
to reflect the change.

727
00:28:18,846 --> 00:28:20,046
And now you've got a completion

728
00:28:20,296 --> 00:28:21,446
for that little circle

729
00:28:21,846 --> 00:28:23,416
So by default, we

730
00:28:23,416 --> 00:28:25,836
we provide detailed views for

731
00:28:26,206 --> 00:28:27,316
but you can implement

732
00:28:27,496 --> 00:28:28,676
to provide your own as well.

733
00:28:28,946 --> 00:28:30,856
So one other thing that

734
00:28:30,896 --> 00:28:34,466
that when the user taps on

735
00:28:34,606 --> 00:28:37,306
for example the hamstring

736
00:28:37,306 --> 00:28:39,316
and bring up a view controller

737
00:28:39,316 --> 00:28:41,266
that lets you send

738
00:28:41,816 --> 00:28:44,296
So there's the two

739
00:28:44,296 --> 00:28:45,966
And then the third one,

740
00:28:45,966 --> 00:28:47,776
go ahead and let's

741
00:28:48,726 --> 00:28:50,766
And now the app will go ahead

742
00:28:50,766 --> 00:28:53,196
to come back in and perform this

743
00:28:54,236 --> 00:28:56,396
So CareKit provides a lot of

744
00:28:56,516 --> 00:28:58,366
so that you can tailor

745
00:28:58,986 --> 00:28:59,796
And these are some of the ones.

746
00:29:00,546 --> 00:29:03,586
So that brings me

747
00:29:03,586 --> 00:29:05,286
or slides What's

748
00:29:06,546 --> 00:29:09,096
Currently, CareKit allows you

749
00:29:10,246 --> 00:29:12,096
Next, we want to focus

750
00:29:12,096 --> 00:29:13,906
between these apps and

751
00:29:13,906 --> 00:29:16,716
and then also transmitting

752
00:29:16,716 --> 00:29:17,896
to the care team app or portal.

753
00:29:18,696 --> 00:29:20,166
This sort of infrastructure

754
00:29:20,166 --> 00:29:23,346
in the Texas Medical Center app

755
00:29:23,496 --> 00:29:26,266
What we would like is, as you're

756
00:29:26,266 --> 00:29:29,036
and linking them to your cloud,

[ Applause ]

763

00:29:46,666 --> 00:29:48,076
You can find the

765
00:29:48,536 --> 00:29:48,636
It's

766
00:29:48,636 --> 00:29:51,396
on github.com/carekit-apple/

767
00:29:52,546 --> 00:29:55,276
So here's how you can help

768
00:29:56,036 --> 00:29:57,786
Your role involves checking

769
00:29:57,786 --> 00:29:59,296
out the issues section

770
00:29:59,736 --> 00:30:01,846
You can create a new issue or

771
00:29:59,736 --> 00:30:01,846
You can create a new issue or

772
00:30:02,156 --> 00:30:03,876
then develop the feature.

773
00:30:04,096 --> 00:30:05,696
Feel free to reach out

774
00:30:05,696 --> 00:30:07,416
with any questions you have

775
00:30:08,186 --> 00:30:10,656
And then work with us through

776
00:30:10,656 --> 00:30:12,516
And this usually involves

777
00:30:12,516 --> 00:30:13,466
and the Apple engineers.

778
00:30:13,816 --> 00:30:16,206
And that's kind of where

779
00:30:16,756 --> 00:30:18,686
Once you have facilitated with

780
00:30:18,686 --> 00:30:20,236
of the feature, we'll

781
00:30:20,236 --> 00:30:22,796
and enhance the feature even

782
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:26,366
We'll localize it for all the

783
00:30:26,566 --> 00:30:29,936
And then we'll do QA testing

784
00:30:30,946 --> 00:30:33,016
We might ask for your help

785
00:30:33,086 --> 00:30:35,216
And then once the feature's

786
00:30:35,216 --> 00:30:36,196
and merge it into the framework.

787
00:30:36,806 --> 00:30:38,576
With CareKit we are

788
00:30:38,576 --> 00:30:39,396
