[ Applause ]

4
00:00:26,366 --> 00:00:27,116
Good afternoon.

5
00:00:27,536 --> 00:00:29,226
I'm Roger Pantos.

6
00:00:29,226 --> 00:00:32,046
This is what's new in

7
00:00:32,625 --> 00:00:36,456
We have been talking about

8
00:00:36,526 --> 00:00:40,236
And yet, every time I do one

9
00:00:40,806 --> 00:00:43,536
"You've got to tell the

10
00:00:43,826 --> 00:00:45,506
And so here we go.

11
00:00:46,156 --> 00:00:47,666
Here's what's new.

12
00:00:48,166 --> 00:00:52,046
But, first, HLS in 20 seconds.

13
00:00:52,326 --> 00:00:54,456
So HLS is about playing

14
00:00:54,456 --> 00:00:55,146
What's a playlist?

15
00:00:55,386 --> 00:00:56,356
It's one of these things.

16
00:00:56,356 --> 00:00:57,216
It's a TXT file.

17
00:00:57,646 --> 00:01:00,586
It's got tags, which are

18
00:00:57,646 --> 00:01:00,586
It's got tags, which are

19
00:01:00,926 --> 00:01:02,766
And it's got segments, which

20
00:01:02,766 --> 00:01:04,025
Each one is 10 seconds of media.

21
00:01:04,025 --> 00:01:06,796
If you want to play one,

22
00:01:06,796 --> 00:01:09,126
through the tags looking for

23
00:01:09,126 --> 00:01:11,226
I don't know -- this one

24
00:01:11,226 --> 00:01:12,456
So, load it first.

25
00:01:12,986 --> 00:01:13,686
So you do that.

26
00:01:14,296 --> 00:01:15,426
Then you load segment1.

27
00:01:15,506 --> 00:01:16,156
You play it.

28
00:01:16,396 --> 00:01:17,306
You load segment2.

29
00:01:17,306 --> 00:01:17,906
You play it.

30
00:01:18,066 --> 00:01:19,266
Maybe it's a live playlist.

31
00:01:19,406 --> 00:01:20,676
So you refresh the playlist.

32
00:01:20,676 --> 00:01:21,636
You load segment3.

33
00:01:21,636 --> 00:01:22,186
You play that.

34
00:01:22,446 --> 00:01:24,576
And that is basically

35
00:01:25,136 --> 00:01:27,886
So now that we're all on

36
00:01:28,696 --> 00:01:29,756
let's go on to what's new.

37
00:01:30,726 --> 00:01:31,946
Sweet. OK.

38
00:01:33,506 --> 00:01:35,246
MPEG-4 Fragment Support.

39
00:01:35,246 --> 00:01:37,766
Who is this MPEG-4 guy

40
00:01:39,406 --> 00:01:40,966
Actually, most of you

41
00:01:40,966 --> 00:01:42,266
with MPEG-4 files.

42
00:01:42,266 --> 00:01:45,626
If you've got a movie on

43
00:01:45,626 --> 00:01:47,886
in MP4 format or one

44
00:01:48,596 --> 00:01:50,526
And if you've ever

45
00:01:50,526 --> 00:01:53,306
it consists of one

46
00:01:53,306 --> 00:01:54,776
usually it's at the beginning --

47
00:01:54,836 --> 00:01:57,486
and then all the sample

48
00:01:58,476 --> 00:01:59,996
And we did that originally.

49
00:01:59,996 --> 00:02:04,166
Then, we introduced a new

50
00:01:59,996 --> 00:02:04,166
Then, we introduced a new

51
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:04,966
called fragments.

52
00:02:04,966 --> 00:02:08,246
And fragments are basically a

53
00:02:08,506 --> 00:02:11,846
and divide it up into these

54
00:02:11,846 --> 00:02:14,336
A little sample table,

55
00:02:14,336 --> 00:02:16,666
A little sample table, a

56
00:02:17,286 --> 00:02:20,746
And these little islands

57
00:02:21,306 --> 00:02:23,596
So what we're announcing

58
00:02:24,026 --> 00:02:28,566
that what you can do now is

59
00:02:28,566 --> 00:02:30,556
of these things, these

60
00:02:30,786 --> 00:02:33,376
and use it as a segment

61
00:02:33,376 --> 00:02:35,326
like you can do with

62
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:37,596
or elementary audio streams.

63
00:02:38,476 --> 00:02:40,506
And we're updating

64
00:02:40,506 --> 00:02:42,046
of give you the details of that.

65
00:02:42,086 --> 00:02:45,146
There should be a link to

66
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:52,786
But what it allows you to do is

67
00:02:52,786 --> 00:02:56,036
and you can do anything

68
00:02:56,096 --> 00:02:58,806
with transport streams

69
00:02:59,046 --> 00:03:01,536
That includes iframe playlists.

70
00:02:59,046 --> 00:03:01,536
That includes iframe playlists.

71
00:03:01,536 --> 00:03:03,116
That includes discontinuities.

72
00:03:03,116 --> 00:03:04,546
That includes live streams.

73
00:03:04,816 --> 00:03:05,506
All that stuff.

74
00:03:05,506 --> 00:03:06,476
Same set of features.

75
00:03:06,786 --> 00:03:10,286
And of course, we're delivering

76
00:03:10,526 --> 00:03:13,976
so you can choose to encode

77
00:03:13,976 --> 00:03:16,026
and deliver them

78
00:03:16,656 --> 00:03:17,576
Why would you do that?

79
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:20,976
Well, in a word,

80
00:03:21,716 --> 00:03:23,896
If you're in a situation

81
00:03:23,896 --> 00:03:27,406
to encode your entire media

82
00:03:27,406 --> 00:03:29,906
to Apple's platforms,

83
00:03:29,906 --> 00:03:34,016
to encode it again in another

84
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:35,596
for instance, that

85
00:03:36,746 --> 00:03:39,486
But if you could have

86
00:03:40,176 --> 00:03:42,376
then your delivery

87
00:03:42,376 --> 00:03:43,736
your storage costs

88
00:03:43,996 --> 00:03:45,826
you would get better

89
00:03:45,826 --> 00:03:47,686
because you're no longer

90
00:03:47,976 --> 00:03:52,336
on the edge, and as

91
00:03:53,346 --> 00:03:56,616
Also, if you've got a

92
00:03:56,816 --> 00:04:01,966
you can use the same set

93
00:03:56,816 --> 00:04:01,966
you can use the same set

94
00:04:02,036 --> 00:04:04,076
across all of your ecosystems.

95
00:04:04,486 --> 00:04:08,186
And as a fringe benefit, because

96
00:04:08,186 --> 00:04:10,906
of packetization that

97
00:04:11,466 --> 00:04:17,086
you get slightly more

98
00:04:17,086 --> 00:04:19,846
So that's sort of a gimmie.

99
00:04:20,065 --> 00:04:24,076
So how does that change HLS

100
00:04:24,786 --> 00:04:26,386
Well, as it turns

101
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:29,426
If we take our playlist here

102
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:33,046
and we convert it to fMP4,

103
00:04:33,486 --> 00:04:35,526
We change the initialization

104
00:04:35,526 --> 00:04:38,906
to a movie box instead, and

105
00:04:39,086 --> 00:04:40,146
MPEG-4 fragment.

106
00:04:41,086 --> 00:04:42,246
And that's it.

107
00:04:42,246 --> 00:04:45,316
Everything else is pretty much

108
00:04:45,906 --> 00:04:48,396
On the segment level, there's

109
00:04:48,396 --> 00:04:50,106
to talk about, which

110
00:04:50,536 --> 00:04:52,826
Now, as you know, HLS

111
00:04:52,826 --> 00:04:54,076
of encrypting your stuff.

112
00:04:54,076 --> 00:04:56,456
You can either just

113
00:04:56,756 --> 00:04:58,396
AES CBC the entire thing.

114
00:04:58,726 --> 00:05:01,686
And that's the same whether

115
00:04:58,726 --> 00:05:01,686
And that's the same whether

116
00:05:02,236 --> 00:05:04,576
For sample encryption,

117
00:05:04,576 --> 00:05:08,286
to use FairPlay Streaming, it's

118
00:05:08,746 --> 00:05:10,696
because you have

119
00:05:10,696 --> 00:05:12,686
of the files are encrypted

120
00:05:13,466 --> 00:05:15,356
And this time around --

121
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:17,006
last time, we did it

122
00:05:17,006 --> 00:05:18,456
We essentially made

123
00:05:18,486 --> 00:05:24,206
This time, we decided

124
00:05:24,736 --> 00:05:29,726
And so this is what MPEG

125
00:05:29,726 --> 00:05:30,406
It's a standard.

126
00:05:30,406 --> 00:05:31,696
It came out a couple years ago.

127
00:05:32,016 --> 00:05:35,746
The newest edition of the

128
00:05:35,746 --> 00:05:37,446
which is compatible

129
00:05:37,866 --> 00:05:40,256
And so if you're doing

130
00:05:40,526 --> 00:05:44,046
you'll be using common

131
00:05:44,476 --> 00:05:47,266
And so with encryption, and

132
00:05:47,266 --> 00:05:50,856
we pretty much have a whole

133
00:05:51,206 --> 00:05:53,106
around fragmented MPEG-4.

134
00:05:53,596 --> 00:05:57,926
But if we're going to get to

135
00:05:57,926 --> 00:06:00,966
where everybody can just have

136
00:05:57,926 --> 00:06:00,966
where everybody can just have

137
00:06:01,216 --> 00:06:04,366
and deliver it everywhere,

138
00:06:04,646 --> 00:06:07,006
And one of the things we need

139
00:06:07,006 --> 00:06:09,876
down a set of rules that

140
00:06:09,876 --> 00:06:14,186
to author your fMP4 segments

141
00:06:14,496 --> 00:06:15,696
so that they play everywhere."

142
00:06:16,316 --> 00:06:17,956
And we've been working

143
00:06:17,986 --> 00:06:21,436
It started as sort

144
00:06:21,796 --> 00:06:23,206
between us and Microsoft.

145
00:06:23,206 --> 00:06:25,606
And once we got to the

146
00:06:25,606 --> 00:06:29,456
like it was practical, it seemed

147
00:06:29,456 --> 00:06:30,726
and proposed it to MPEG.

148
00:06:31,086 --> 00:06:32,566
And a lot of folks there seemed

149
00:06:32,566 --> 00:06:33,746
to think it was a

150
00:06:34,076 --> 00:06:39,106
So what it comes down to is

151
00:06:39,106 --> 00:06:42,166
for how you construct

152
00:06:42,546 --> 00:06:45,466
So you've got to deliver your

153
00:06:45,466 --> 00:06:47,516
You've got to put an

154
00:06:47,516 --> 00:06:48,626
of every video segment.

155
00:06:48,876 --> 00:06:51,326
You have to make sure you

156
00:06:51,326 --> 00:06:52,676
across your different bit rates.

157
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:54,766
You don't have to

158
00:06:54,766 --> 00:06:56,586
if all you want to

159
00:06:57,076 --> 00:07:00,296
But if you want the broadest

160
00:06:57,076 --> 00:07:00,296
But if you want the broadest

161
00:07:00,296 --> 00:07:03,936
of your media library, then

162
00:07:03,936 --> 00:07:05,126
of recommendations for you.

163
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:08,616
And so I think that

164
00:07:08,616 --> 00:07:11,356
up benefiting everyone

165
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:16,056
So now I'm going to switch

166
00:07:16,056 --> 00:07:17,896
about something else --

167
00:07:18,356 --> 00:07:20,036
everyone's favorite

168
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:25,646
So to sort of frame this,

169
00:07:25,646 --> 00:07:28,046
about some of the existing

170
00:07:28,046 --> 00:07:29,746
for you in HLS for metadata.

171
00:07:29,746 --> 00:07:32,486
Static metadata and ID3.

172
00:07:33,056 --> 00:07:35,946
Static metadata is used

173
00:07:36,396 --> 00:07:37,006
No surprise.

174
00:07:37,176 --> 00:07:39,446
So it'll offer for

175
00:07:39,446 --> 00:07:40,186
or something like that.

176
00:07:40,486 --> 00:07:43,586
Most of it is text, and that

177
00:07:43,586 --> 00:07:46,356
into the playlist file

178
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:50,036
or you can package it as a

179
00:07:52,686 --> 00:07:55,286
Now you only get one

180
00:07:55,286 --> 00:07:58,516
or one copyright per

181
00:07:59,276 --> 00:08:01,406
But the benefit of that is

182
00:07:59,276 --> 00:08:01,406
But the benefit of that is

183
00:08:01,406 --> 00:08:03,336
that it's available

184
00:08:03,336 --> 00:08:05,876
It's available right away.

185
00:08:06,126 --> 00:08:10,736
So let's contrast that to ID3.

186
00:08:10,736 --> 00:08:14,396
Because timed metadata

187
00:08:14,396 --> 00:08:17,176
of the media presentation,

188
00:08:17,176 --> 00:08:19,176
for signaling events

189
00:08:19,176 --> 00:08:22,156
For instance, the start of an

190
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:25,916
It lives inside the

191
00:08:25,946 --> 00:08:28,006
so it's a binary

192
00:08:28,696 --> 00:08:30,006
And that makes it compact.

193
00:08:30,006 --> 00:08:32,296
It also makes it kind

194
00:08:32,296 --> 00:08:33,895
because it requires

195
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:35,836
It's kind of a pain in the

196
00:08:36,155 --> 00:08:37,405
It's hard to read ID3.

197
00:08:38,436 --> 00:08:40,346
But you can have as

198
00:08:40,476 --> 00:08:42,856
and you can put them anywhere

199
00:08:43,126 --> 00:08:44,196
And so that's powerful.

200
00:08:45,226 --> 00:08:47,716
The flipside of that however

201
00:08:48,096 --> 00:08:50,766
we can't give it to you until

202
00:08:52,236 --> 00:08:55,586
So where does the new guy fit?

203
00:08:56,556 --> 00:08:58,176
What we're adding is a way

204
00:08:58,176 --> 00:09:01,766
to author timed metadata

205
00:08:58,176 --> 00:09:01,766
to author timed metadata

206
00:09:02,806 --> 00:09:04,986
And so you can use it

207
00:09:04,986 --> 00:09:07,526
that you're using ID3 for today.

208
00:09:09,556 --> 00:09:11,536
You can author them as text.

209
00:09:11,616 --> 00:09:12,726
So that's pretty easy.

210
00:09:12,996 --> 00:09:15,476
You can easily put

211
00:09:16,456 --> 00:09:18,516
and you can have as

212
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:19,656
They can be overlapping.

213
00:09:19,656 --> 00:09:20,326
They can nest.

214
00:09:20,376 --> 00:09:21,176
They can do whatever.

215
00:09:22,766 --> 00:09:26,596
And on the other hand, because

216
00:09:26,716 --> 00:09:28,636
we can give you the

217
00:09:28,636 --> 00:09:31,196
as we read the playlist

218
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:32,626
where the playhead

219
00:09:33,276 --> 00:09:35,296
And so that makes

220
00:09:35,296 --> 00:09:38,376
For doing things particularly

221
00:09:39,866 --> 00:09:40,946
So what does it look like?

222
00:09:41,176 --> 00:09:45,206
How do we make it sort of sit?

223
00:09:45,616 --> 00:09:48,556
Well, we already had the

224
00:09:48,556 --> 00:09:50,836
We have the PROGRAM-DATE-TIME

225
00:09:50,836 --> 00:09:53,246
to precisely signal

226
00:09:53,246 --> 00:09:55,256
So we built on top

227
00:09:55,256 --> 00:10:01,276
each bit of metadata is going to

228
00:09:55,256 --> 00:10:01,276
each bit of metadata is going to

229
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:04,296
that has a set of

230
00:10:04,886 --> 00:10:06,336
And some of those are ours.

231
00:10:06,336 --> 00:10:07,566
Some of those are yours.

232
00:10:07,896 --> 00:10:12,086
We set up the syntax so

233
00:10:12,086 --> 00:10:13,956
and remove these

234
00:10:14,266 --> 00:10:16,526
So it meshes really well

235
00:10:16,576 --> 00:10:20,466
So what does it look like?

236
00:10:21,336 --> 00:10:23,956
Let's take a look at

237
00:10:24,816 --> 00:10:27,136
We called the new tag

238
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:28,446
Here's another playlist.

239
00:10:28,676 --> 00:10:30,816
The first guy says

240
00:10:31,156 --> 00:10:32,486
The second one is

241
00:10:32,486 --> 00:10:35,286
And if you look at it, what

242
00:10:35,286 --> 00:10:36,666
of attributes.

243
00:10:37,116 --> 00:10:39,666
These guys here, these

244
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:40,846
that are defined by the spec --

245
00:10:41,186 --> 00:10:43,226
the ID, the START-DATE,

246
00:10:44,106 --> 00:10:47,776
These guys, we reserve

247
00:10:47,776 --> 00:10:50,486
to HTTP for all you guys.

248
00:10:50,486 --> 00:10:51,816
So you can use that to put

249
00:10:51,816 --> 00:10:53,556
in whatever attribute

250
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:55,296
In this case, someone

251
00:10:55,296 --> 00:10:57,536
in an AD-ID and a beacon URL.

252
00:10:58,186 --> 00:10:59,776
So that's an example.

253
00:10:59,776 --> 00:11:02,356
That's what one of these guys

254
00:10:59,776 --> 00:11:02,356
That's what one of these guys

255
00:11:03,846 --> 00:11:05,506
When you're doing your

256
00:11:06,456 --> 00:11:08,496
you can use it either

257
00:11:08,496 --> 00:11:11,166
It just has to have a

258
00:11:11,226 --> 00:11:14,076
You can obviously

259
00:11:14,076 --> 00:11:15,936
in when you're creating

260
00:11:16,056 --> 00:11:18,726
But the other nice thing is,

261
00:11:18,726 --> 00:11:20,966
to manipulate, if

262
00:11:20,966 --> 00:11:23,536
like a post-production workflow

263
00:11:23,536 --> 00:11:25,586
or something like

264
00:11:25,586 --> 00:11:27,976
to augment the playlist

265
00:11:27,976 --> 00:11:29,316
with metadata at the same time.

266
00:11:30,096 --> 00:11:34,926
By popular request, we

267
00:11:34,926 --> 00:11:38,846
to map SCTE-35 that you might

268
00:11:39,326 --> 00:11:41,076
into the DATERANGE tags.

269
00:11:41,276 --> 00:11:46,196
So you can carry SCTE-35

270
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:51,006
And finally, we've added support

271
00:11:51,226 --> 00:11:53,726
And I actually wanted to take

272
00:11:53,726 --> 00:11:55,316
to the new set of tools we have.

273
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:57,446
We put together a talk --

274
00:11:57,446 --> 00:11:59,666
we don't have time to talk about

275
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:02,426
but we put together a talk

276
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:02,426
but we put together a talk

277
00:12:02,826 --> 00:12:04,706
And so I'd encourage

278
00:12:04,966 --> 00:12:09,136
It's on demand on your apps

279
00:12:09,136 --> 00:12:10,556
And you should check it

280
00:12:10,556 --> 00:12:13,086
of new tricks the validator

281
00:12:13,876 --> 00:12:18,236
So for playback, when

282
00:12:18,236 --> 00:12:20,246
on the metadata that's

283
00:12:20,246 --> 00:12:24,016
you have a set of

284
00:12:24,306 --> 00:12:26,816
And so you have to be

285
00:12:27,466 --> 00:12:29,266
And the APIs are essentially,

286
00:12:29,396 --> 00:12:31,166
give me all the data

287
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:33,766
And then if you've

288
00:12:33,826 --> 00:12:35,186
tell me when something

289
00:12:36,396 --> 00:12:42,146
And it's centered around

290
00:12:42,146 --> 00:12:44,916
AVPlayerItemMetadataCollector.

291
00:12:45,636 --> 00:12:47,886
And so we've got a

292
00:12:47,886 --> 00:12:49,616
You can see it doing

293
00:12:49,616 --> 00:12:51,676
You create your asset.

294
00:12:51,676 --> 00:12:52,736
You create your PlayerItem.

295
00:12:52,736 --> 00:12:54,746
And then you say, "Hey, I want

296
00:12:55,036 --> 00:12:57,126
So you create the

297
00:12:57,466 --> 00:12:58,836
You set yourself

298
00:12:58,836 --> 00:12:59,956
so we can tell you stuff,

299
00:12:59,956 --> 00:13:01,696
and then you add it

300
00:12:59,956 --> 00:13:01,696
and then you add it

301
00:13:02,296 --> 00:13:03,536
And that's it.

302
00:13:03,676 --> 00:13:07,316
Then you get all

303
00:13:07,856 --> 00:13:10,616
And so it's really easy to use.

304
00:13:10,616 --> 00:13:11,646
It's really powerful.

305
00:13:12,076 --> 00:13:15,466
And I think that it's going

306
00:13:15,466 --> 00:13:18,026
to carry metadata

307
00:13:18,476 --> 00:13:21,256
So the next thing

308
00:13:21,256 --> 00:13:27,136
about today is another feature

309
00:13:27,696 --> 00:13:33,846
And that is the ability to

310
00:13:35,516 --> 00:13:39,546
[ Applause ]

311
00:13:40,046 --> 00:13:42,076
And to talk about that, I'm

312
00:13:42,076 --> 00:13:44,906
Jordan Schneider, to come

313
00:13:45,516 --> 00:13:51,716
[ Applause ]

314
00:13:52,216 --> 00:13:57,296
&gt;&gt; Hey. So, let's see

315
00:13:57,746 --> 00:13:59,066
There we go.

316
00:13:59,856 --> 00:14:04,056
In iOS 10, we are bringing

317
00:13:59,856 --> 00:14:04,056
In iOS 10, we are bringing

318
00:14:04,056 --> 00:14:06,566
and then play HLS content

319
00:14:07,426 --> 00:14:09,756
So now you can bring

320
00:14:09,756 --> 00:14:13,006
to your users using

321
00:14:13,006 --> 00:14:13,696
video library.

322
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:15,886
So as part of this feature,

323
00:14:15,996 --> 00:14:18,816
we are extending the

324
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:24,146
that we introduced to you last

325
00:14:24,766 --> 00:14:27,156
and we are providing you a way

326
00:14:27,156 --> 00:14:29,446
to download your HLS

327
00:14:29,446 --> 00:14:30,366
is backgrounded.

328
00:14:31,156 --> 00:14:33,776
And finally, we are

329
00:14:33,776 --> 00:14:37,116
to play partially-downloaded

330
00:14:37,116 --> 00:14:38,226
might still be in progress.

331
00:14:39,386 --> 00:14:43,916
So the first question - when

332
00:14:44,716 --> 00:14:48,956
Well, yes, if you want to

333
00:14:48,956 --> 00:14:53,136
when your user might want to

334
00:14:53,136 --> 00:14:55,026
that they might not have

335
00:14:55,326 --> 00:14:56,686
such as when they go

336
00:14:57,186 --> 00:14:59,736
However, this feature is not

337
00:14:59,736 --> 00:15:00,426
loading media.

338
00:14:59,736 --> 00:15:00,426
loading media.

339
00:15:00,946 --> 00:15:03,516
We have other ways of doing

340
00:15:04,746 --> 00:15:08,336
So why use HLS for

341
00:15:08,336 --> 00:15:09,816
than just downloading

342
00:15:10,286 --> 00:15:12,616
Well, for one, your content

343
00:15:12,976 --> 00:15:13,426
as HLS.

344
00:15:13,516 --> 00:15:16,836
So adopting HLS for offline

345
00:15:16,836 --> 00:15:19,516
convenient story for you from

346
00:15:20,116 --> 00:15:22,506
But also, in addition

347
00:15:22,976 --> 00:15:25,826
movie files can contain

348
00:15:25,826 --> 00:15:28,846
and subtitle tracks that your

349
00:15:28,846 --> 00:15:30,156
or want to persist offline.

350
00:15:31,066 --> 00:15:35,426
So in HLS, because all these

351
00:15:35,426 --> 00:15:38,276
on the server into

352
00:15:38,276 --> 00:15:41,326
we can have a little

353
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:44,026
Specifically, we can

354
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:45,786
over which media

355
00:15:46,126 --> 00:15:48,266
saving your user

356
00:15:48,266 --> 00:15:50,166
and storage space

357
00:15:50,766 --> 00:15:54,656
So, for example, by default

358
00:15:54,656 --> 00:15:57,756
media selection, which is likely

359
00:15:57,756 --> 00:15:58,816
about when they play offline.

360
00:15:58,816 --> 00:16:00,856
What we're also providing

361
00:15:58,816 --> 00:16:00,856
What we're also providing

362
00:16:00,856 --> 00:16:04,796
to configure exactly what you

363
00:16:04,796 --> 00:16:06,556
to have available

364
00:16:07,706 --> 00:16:12,996
So another cool thing about

365
00:16:13,256 --> 00:16:14,316
using the same asset,

366
00:16:14,356 --> 00:16:16,966
we can still download

367
00:16:16,966 --> 00:16:19,946
that have not been downloaded so

368
00:16:19,946 --> 00:16:21,906
on your server, which is nice.

369
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:25,036
So how do you do this?

370
00:16:25,336 --> 00:16:27,856
In iOS 10, we're

371
00:16:27,856 --> 00:16:31,046
to download AVAssets

372
00:16:31,696 --> 00:16:35,246
This class inherits

373
00:16:35,596 --> 00:16:39,256
Most importantly, the

374
00:16:39,256 --> 00:16:42,286
in the background even while

375
00:16:42,286 --> 00:16:43,206
of its mechanisms.

376
00:16:43,886 --> 00:16:45,696
As I mentioned before,

377
00:16:45,696 --> 00:16:48,346
to control which media

378
00:16:48,836 --> 00:16:52,926
And because this is HLS,

379
00:16:52,926 --> 00:16:55,306
to select the quality of

380
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:56,666
to download for offline as well.

381
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:59,256
So the interface

382
00:16:59,336 --> 00:17:01,336
of AVAssetDownloadTask

383
00:16:59,336 --> 00:17:01,336
of AVAssetDownloadTask

384
00:17:01,786 --> 00:17:04,266
It inherits from URLSessionTask.

385
00:17:04,266 --> 00:17:06,476
I want to mention here

386
00:17:06,476 --> 00:17:08,336
from URLSessionDownloadTask.

387
00:17:08,746 --> 00:17:10,896
It behaves similarly, but

388
00:17:10,896 --> 00:17:13,626
that I'll point out as the

389
00:17:13,626 --> 00:17:15,016
So to create one

390
00:17:15,016 --> 00:17:18,816
you want to set up a URLSession.

391
00:17:18,816 --> 00:17:20,896
Now we have a specific subclass

392
00:17:20,896 --> 00:17:23,516
of URLSession called

393
00:17:23,516 --> 00:17:24,816
that you have to use

394
00:17:25,366 --> 00:17:27,425
And so you call

395
00:17:27,425 --> 00:17:28,856
to create an asset

396
00:17:29,406 --> 00:17:31,756
And then for your

397
00:17:31,756 --> 00:17:34,196
we have a minimum required

398
00:17:34,586 --> 00:17:36,376
as well as a media

399
00:17:37,206 --> 00:17:40,796
Now I should note here that each

400
00:17:40,796 --> 00:17:42,846
to a single set of

401
00:17:43,256 --> 00:17:45,306
So if you want to download

402
00:17:45,306 --> 00:17:47,406
on the same asset, then

403
00:17:47,406 --> 00:17:49,776
up multiple AVAssetDownloadTasks

404
00:17:50,066 --> 00:17:51,766
I'll show you how to do

405
00:17:52,786 --> 00:17:55,366
So to use one of these

406
00:17:55,886 --> 00:17:59,306
The first thing is to set

407
00:17:59,306 --> 00:18:01,356
configure it how you want

408
00:17:59,306 --> 00:18:01,356
configure it how you want

409
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:04,126
Next, we want to

410
00:18:04,126 --> 00:18:05,626
that might occur

411
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:07,326
such as monitoring the

412
00:18:08,336 --> 00:18:10,336
Then once the download

413
00:18:10,336 --> 00:18:12,386
to store the location

414
00:18:12,386 --> 00:18:13,386
when we're actually offline.

415
00:18:14,316 --> 00:18:15,456
And then you might want

416
00:18:15,456 --> 00:18:18,046
to download additional media

417
00:18:18,786 --> 00:18:22,256
And finally, you're going

418
00:18:22,436 --> 00:18:26,796
So to set up one of these

419
00:18:26,796 --> 00:18:30,326
after you have your asset set up

420
00:18:30,326 --> 00:18:31,746
up a backgrounConfiguration

421
00:18:31,746 --> 00:18:34,636
from a background

422
00:18:35,466 --> 00:18:38,676
Then you're going to create

423
00:18:39,136 --> 00:18:42,296
and then create your

424
00:18:42,296 --> 00:18:45,526
Here, I have the download

425
00:18:45,526 --> 00:18:47,916
at about a media bit rate of

426
00:18:48,296 --> 00:18:51,046
But by default, we'll

427
00:18:51,586 --> 00:18:52,696
video available.

428
00:18:53,436 --> 00:18:54,746
Then once you have that set up,

429
00:18:54,746 --> 00:18:56,466
because this is a

430
00:18:56,466 --> 00:18:58,126
you just call resume

431
00:18:59,536 --> 00:19:01,456
So once you have your download

432
00:18:59,536 --> 00:19:01,456
So once you have your download

433
00:19:01,456 --> 00:19:02,246
to want to monitor it.

434
00:19:03,076 --> 00:19:05,216
To do this, we have

435
00:19:05,216 --> 00:19:07,346
for you called

436
00:19:07,676 --> 00:19:09,986
So this inherits the

437
00:19:09,986 --> 00:19:12,136
that URLSessionTaskDelegate has.

438
00:19:12,676 --> 00:19:15,156
But I want to point out two

439
00:19:15,156 --> 00:19:16,476
that we are introducing to you.

440
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:18,806
One is our method that we use

441
00:19:18,806 --> 00:19:21,656
to monitor the progress

442
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:26,346
In this method, we express

443
00:19:26,346 --> 00:19:28,216
and time ranges as

444
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:30,696
for better parlance

445
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:34,726
And then we have a

446
00:19:34,726 --> 00:19:36,026
delegate method which

447
00:19:36,026 --> 00:19:38,616
where the download

448
00:19:38,716 --> 00:19:39,696
So this is similar

449
00:19:39,696 --> 00:19:43,156
to URLSessionDownloadDelegate's

450
00:19:43,606 --> 00:19:45,866
But your expectation

451
00:19:46,636 --> 00:19:49,826
when you get this

452
00:19:49,826 --> 00:19:50,436
bit differently.

453
00:19:50,476 --> 00:19:53,566
So I'll point that

454
00:19:53,676 --> 00:19:57,366
So here's an example of our

455
00:19:57,366 --> 00:20:00,476
Here, I'm just converting

456
00:19:57,366 --> 00:20:00,476
Here, I'm just converting

457
00:20:00,476 --> 00:20:01,976
to a percent -- complete

458
00:20:02,046 --> 00:20:03,876
I'm not going to go

459
00:20:03,876 --> 00:20:05,226
but that's how you

460
00:20:06,466 --> 00:20:09,036
Another thing that might happen

461
00:20:09,036 --> 00:20:09,746
might be killed.

462
00:20:10,116 --> 00:20:11,506
The process might be terminated.

463
00:20:11,506 --> 00:20:13,666
And then what do you do?

464
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:14,716
Your download continues.

465
00:20:15,066 --> 00:20:17,706
Well, to respond to that, you

466
00:20:17,706 --> 00:20:19,496
to URLSessionDownloadTasks.

467
00:20:19,786 --> 00:20:22,546
And that's by, when your app

468
00:20:22,546 --> 00:20:25,286
to set up another background

469
00:20:25,286 --> 00:20:28,036
identifier you used to set up

470
00:20:28,366 --> 00:20:30,306
and then create a

471
00:20:30,626 --> 00:20:32,676
And then from there, call

472
00:20:32,676 --> 00:20:35,836
And then here, you can restore

473
00:20:35,836 --> 00:20:37,916
which will have the

474
00:20:37,916 --> 00:20:39,406
And you can use this

475
00:20:39,406 --> 00:20:40,366
that you might have in the app.

476
00:20:40,606 --> 00:20:43,896
And you can even use it to

477
00:20:43,896 --> 00:20:45,386
that you used to set

478
00:20:46,306 --> 00:20:50,256
So once your download finishes,

479
00:20:50,256 --> 00:20:52,786
to want to do is store the

480
00:20:53,496 --> 00:20:56,956
So this method is called

481
00:20:56,956 --> 00:20:58,746
at this location, including

482
00:20:58,746 --> 00:21:02,116
when a partially-downloaded

483
00:20:58,746 --> 00:21:02,116
when a partially-downloaded

484
00:21:02,116 --> 00:21:02,956
by your user.

485
00:21:03,386 --> 00:21:05,676
Now you can use this

486
00:21:05,706 --> 00:21:12,186
cancelled download to resume

487
00:21:12,516 --> 00:21:13,376
Or you can even use it

488
00:21:13,376 --> 00:21:16,176
to playback whatever has

489
00:21:16,636 --> 00:21:18,686
But if you really don't

490
00:21:18,806 --> 00:21:21,566
or that content there on

491
00:21:21,886 --> 00:21:23,746
then here's where you

492
00:21:24,546 --> 00:21:28,066
So, unlike

493
00:21:28,336 --> 00:21:32,056
we ask that you do not move

494
00:21:32,536 --> 00:21:34,336
And we do this because

495
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:36,216
that the system be able

496
00:21:36,216 --> 00:21:38,606
as the system may want

497
00:21:38,606 --> 00:21:40,556
in low disk space

498
00:21:40,556 --> 00:21:42,626
at some point go out

499
00:21:42,966 --> 00:21:44,706
from your app container.

500
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:47,756
So what you're going to

501
00:21:47,756 --> 00:21:50,176
to be the relative

502
00:21:50,176 --> 00:21:53,046
And then from there, you will

503
00:21:53,046 --> 00:21:54,156
in the future for playback.

504
00:21:55,656 --> 00:21:59,966
So, now that you have a version

505
00:22:00,396 --> 00:22:02,576
let's say you want to download

506
00:22:03,266 --> 00:22:04,956
A good place to do this would be

507
00:22:04,956 --> 00:22:08,036
in our didCompleteWithError

508
00:22:08,036 --> 00:22:10,196
This is the same one

509
00:22:10,806 --> 00:22:13,456
And the reason why it

510
00:22:13,456 --> 00:22:14,506
because media selections

511
00:22:14,506 --> 00:22:16,556
on the same asset are

512
00:22:16,876 --> 00:22:20,416
And this is generally the

513
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:21,976
of the complete download.

514
00:22:22,636 --> 00:22:26,606
So, to augment with an

515
00:22:26,606 --> 00:22:28,906
option -- say, the

516
00:22:28,906 --> 00:22:30,656
we would first grab

517
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:31,486
that we want to download.

518
00:22:32,166 --> 00:22:35,676
Then we would mutate

519
00:22:35,676 --> 00:22:37,876
that we originally passed

520
00:22:37,876 --> 00:22:40,926
in to select the

521
00:22:41,576 --> 00:22:43,816
And then once we have that

522
00:22:43,816 --> 00:22:47,416
to create a new

523
00:22:47,416 --> 00:22:50,626
on the same session with passing

524
00:22:50,626 --> 00:22:51,676
we want to download.

525
00:22:51,976 --> 00:22:53,046
And then we call resume,

526
00:22:53,046 --> 00:22:55,276
and then the whole

527
00:22:55,276 --> 00:22:57,066
And then we could download

528
00:22:57,066 --> 00:22:58,736
after that if we wanted to.

529
00:23:00,156 --> 00:23:02,056
So let's talk about

530
00:23:03,166 --> 00:23:06,846
So, say we had a --

531
00:23:07,356 --> 00:23:09,826
of how we could create

532
00:23:09,826 --> 00:23:13,186
And notice that I pass in an

533
00:23:13,656 --> 00:23:18,296
When we playback offline

534
00:23:18,296 --> 00:23:21,666
that original urlAsset

535
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:25,406
that AVAsset instance to play.

536
00:23:25,776 --> 00:23:28,696
And we can grab this from

537
00:23:28,696 --> 00:23:29,686
the AssetDownloadTask.

538
00:23:30,116 --> 00:23:32,316
If you pass in a new

539
00:23:32,316 --> 00:23:33,436
AVFoundation will not know

540
00:23:33,436 --> 00:23:35,686
where to find the

541
00:23:36,066 --> 00:23:37,616
So you should use

542
00:23:37,616 --> 00:23:39,566
and then you will

543
00:23:40,126 --> 00:23:43,026
However, if you no

544
00:23:43,026 --> 00:23:45,166
to that original AVAsset --

545
00:23:45,626 --> 00:23:48,356
for example, a long

546
00:23:48,356 --> 00:23:50,476
when your app might not

547
00:23:50,936 --> 00:23:52,626
then what you're going to want

548
00:23:52,676 --> 00:23:56,826
to create a new AVAsset

549
00:23:56,826 --> 00:23:57,726
that we supplied to you

550
00:23:57,726 --> 00:24:00,096
in the didFinishDownloadingTo

551
00:23:57,726 --> 00:24:00,096
in the didFinishDownloadingTo

552
00:24:00,526 --> 00:24:02,356
and create a PlayerItem

553
00:24:03,226 --> 00:24:05,836
Now even in this case, if

554
00:24:05,916 --> 00:24:08,896
on the asset -- for example,

555
00:24:08,966 --> 00:24:11,396
augment with an additional

556
00:24:11,716 --> 00:24:13,756
you really should

557
00:24:13,756 --> 00:24:14,706
You shouldn't have a bunch

558
00:24:14,706 --> 00:24:19,586
of AVAssets pointing toward

559
00:24:20,096 --> 00:24:21,616
This helps AVFoundation

560
00:24:21,616 --> 00:24:24,166
about reusing already-downloaded

561
00:24:25,356 --> 00:24:29,676
So we also have an additional

562
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:32,426
about what you let your

563
00:24:32,426 --> 00:24:33,956
and this is called AVAssetCache.

564
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:37,206
You grab this from the asset

565
00:24:37,206 --> 00:24:38,906
And it can do two things.

566
00:24:39,016 --> 00:24:42,746
One is that it can tell

567
00:24:42,746 --> 00:24:44,886
of this asset is

568
00:24:45,436 --> 00:24:48,956
And the other thing it can do

569
00:24:48,956 --> 00:24:50,976
specific media selection

570
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:52,786
Now, remember, if it's

571
00:24:52,786 --> 00:24:55,186
it's still playable so long as

572
00:24:55,476 --> 00:24:58,286
and that media selection option

573
00:24:58,286 --> 00:24:59,406
that you downloaded it from.

574
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:03,206
So, that's how you use

575
00:25:03,326 --> 00:25:06,496
and play the subsequent

576
00:25:06,806 --> 00:25:08,576
And I should note

577
00:25:08,576 --> 00:25:10,866
playing the download asset

578
00:25:11,246 --> 00:25:13,086
at any point in this process.

579
00:25:13,086 --> 00:25:16,706
It can even happen before

580
00:25:16,706 --> 00:25:17,866
or even during the download.

581
00:25:17,866 --> 00:25:20,476
And AVFoundation will be

582
00:25:20,476 --> 00:25:22,976
to reuse what has already been

583
00:25:24,036 --> 00:25:25,866
So I want to switch gears

584
00:25:25,866 --> 00:25:27,816
about securing the

585
00:25:28,656 --> 00:25:32,166
So, last year, we

586
00:25:32,166 --> 00:25:34,786
to bring strong content

587
00:25:35,526 --> 00:25:39,176
However, in iOS 9, FairPlay

588
00:25:39,176 --> 00:25:40,486
connection to a key server,

589
00:25:40,486 --> 00:25:43,186
which doesn't really work

590
00:25:43,766 --> 00:25:46,406
So, this year, we've extended

591
00:25:46,406 --> 00:25:49,866
without an internet connection

592
00:25:50,406 --> 00:25:54,206
Now we do this by packaging your

593
00:25:54,206 --> 00:25:56,796
to store on disk and reuse

594
00:25:57,266 --> 00:26:00,606
But your app is still expected

595
00:25:57,266 --> 00:26:00,606
But your app is still expected

596
00:26:00,606 --> 00:26:03,876
and respond to key

597
00:26:03,876 --> 00:26:06,916
on every single playback without

598
00:26:06,916 --> 00:26:07,666
its key cached.

599
00:26:08,636 --> 00:26:11,326
So support for these keys

600
00:26:11,326 --> 00:26:14,496
in your key servers,

601
00:26:14,496 --> 00:26:17,096
so your key servers have

602
00:26:17,096 --> 00:26:19,046
to be eligible for

603
00:26:20,266 --> 00:26:23,536
And finally, we have

604
00:26:23,866 --> 00:26:26,536
They must be declared in your

605
00:26:26,536 --> 00:26:28,456
if you want to make sure

606
00:26:29,656 --> 00:26:33,956
So, storing keys for offline

607
00:26:33,956 --> 00:26:37,326
off the request flow of

608
00:26:37,586 --> 00:26:39,706
And so what you have to

609
00:26:39,706 --> 00:26:41,436
with how you modify

610
00:26:41,886 --> 00:26:43,876
I'll give a quick recap

611
00:26:43,876 --> 00:26:44,896
out what you need to do.

612
00:26:45,246 --> 00:26:47,636
But for more information, you

613
00:26:47,636 --> 00:26:49,226
where we go into this

614
00:26:50,526 --> 00:26:52,996
So just like in FairPlay

615
00:26:52,996 --> 00:26:54,636
AVFoundation will

616
00:26:54,636 --> 00:26:56,896
and trigger a key request

617
00:26:57,166 --> 00:26:58,946
which will give your

618
00:26:58,946 --> 00:27:00,566
to save the key for

619
00:26:58,946 --> 00:27:00,566
to save the key for

620
00:27:01,146 --> 00:27:04,406
So the first thing your app

621
00:27:04,406 --> 00:27:06,876
to AVFoundation to get

622
00:27:07,216 --> 00:27:10,966
Then it would talk to your

623
00:27:10,966 --> 00:27:11,836
that streaming key request

624
00:27:11,836 --> 00:27:14,426
and give you a content

625
00:27:14,506 --> 00:27:17,186
And then in online

626
00:27:17,186 --> 00:27:19,886
this is where you would finish

627
00:27:19,886 --> 00:27:21,916
to AVFoundation with that CKC.

628
00:27:22,436 --> 00:27:26,476
However, in offline FairPlay

629
00:27:26,476 --> 00:27:29,216
to give that CKC to AVFoundation

630
00:27:29,216 --> 00:27:32,486
so AVFoundation can freeze-dry

631
00:27:32,486 --> 00:27:35,426
for you to store into

632
00:27:35,726 --> 00:27:38,156
And this is something

633
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:40,716
on subsequent playbacks.

634
00:27:40,856 --> 00:27:43,196
So once you have this thing

635
00:27:43,456 --> 00:27:46,616
you want to return that

636
00:27:46,616 --> 00:27:47,676
to complete the request.

637
00:27:48,016 --> 00:27:50,126
Now if your app were offline,

638
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:52,766
to do is read that freeze-dried

639
00:27:53,006 --> 00:27:55,726
and return it to AVFoundation

640
00:27:55,726 --> 00:27:56,556
without touching the network.

641
00:27:58,016 --> 00:27:59,826
So let's look at how this

642
00:28:00,796 --> 00:28:04,866
So in online FairPlay Streaming,

643
00:28:04,976 --> 00:28:06,676
as a part of

644
00:28:06,946 --> 00:28:08,536
specifically as a

645
00:28:08,536 --> 00:28:11,116
on

646
00:28:11,666 --> 00:28:13,016
So the first thing you

647
00:28:13,016 --> 00:28:15,446
of these requests

648
00:28:15,446 --> 00:28:19,676
to create a streaming

649
00:28:19,766 --> 00:28:21,726
which sends that to your server.

650
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:24,526
And then you get a CKC

651
00:28:24,526 --> 00:28:26,066
to AVFoundation with that.

652
00:28:27,596 --> 00:28:30,926
Now in offline FairPlay

653
00:28:30,926 --> 00:28:33,066
This is the method that you

654
00:28:33,066 --> 00:28:36,636
You pass in the CKC you

655
00:28:36,996 --> 00:28:40,296
and it returns back that

656
00:28:40,296 --> 00:28:41,256
for you to store offline.

657
00:28:42,096 --> 00:28:44,926
We also have a new content type

658
00:28:44,926 --> 00:28:46,406
the persistentContentKey type --

659
00:28:46,966 --> 00:28:48,926
and a new option to pass

660
00:28:48,926 --> 00:28:52,666
into our streaming content key

661
00:28:54,086 --> 00:28:59,846
So here is how we would modify

662
00:28:59,846 --> 00:29:00,876
that we want to save offline.

663
00:28:59,846 --> 00:29:00,876
that we want to save offline.

664
00:29:01,516 --> 00:29:03,256
The first thing that we want

665
00:29:03,506 --> 00:29:06,026
to do is ask AVFoundation

666
00:29:06,626 --> 00:29:08,036
The difference here is

667
00:29:08,036 --> 00:29:09,826
in the required persistentKey

668
00:29:09,826 --> 00:29:12,616
So that way, AVFoundation

669
00:29:12,616 --> 00:29:14,886
to request a key

670
00:29:14,886 --> 00:29:16,276
for that freeze-dry process.

671
00:29:17,016 --> 00:29:19,296
So it sends this SPC to

672
00:29:19,296 --> 00:29:21,336
And then once you

673
00:29:21,486 --> 00:29:23,196
you call your

674
00:29:23,466 --> 00:29:25,796
to create this freeze-dried

675
00:29:26,566 --> 00:29:28,256
Then, you want to actually

676
00:29:28,906 --> 00:29:30,796
And then, you want to

677
00:29:30,796 --> 00:29:33,066
to a persistentContentKey type

678
00:29:33,736 --> 00:29:38,086
and then finish the downloading

679
00:29:38,086 --> 00:29:40,616
that you saved to your disk.

680
00:29:41,506 --> 00:29:43,316
So now if you are offline,

681
00:29:43,316 --> 00:29:45,926
or say you already satisfied

682
00:29:46,666 --> 00:29:48,566
then this is what you will do.

683
00:29:49,276 --> 00:29:51,466
You get your resource

684
00:29:52,296 --> 00:29:56,566
and you just simply read

685
00:29:56,566 --> 00:29:58,506
from your app storage.

686
00:29:59,386 --> 00:30:01,106
Then you set your

687
00:29:59,386 --> 00:30:01,106
Then you set your

688
00:30:01,546 --> 00:30:03,386
and you respond to the

689
00:30:03,386 --> 00:30:06,556
without hitting the network,

690
00:30:06,646 --> 00:30:09,716
as you may potentially

691
00:30:09,716 --> 00:30:11,726
and don't have any

692
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:12,386
this process.

693
00:30:13,106 --> 00:30:15,906
So that's how you modify

694
00:30:15,906 --> 00:30:18,056
with your offline HLS content.

695
00:30:19,286 --> 00:30:21,446
So now I want to talk

696
00:30:21,446 --> 00:30:23,626
for managing your assets.

697
00:30:23,626 --> 00:30:26,556
So it's important to note that

698
00:30:26,556 --> 00:30:27,676
to your app's disk usage,

699
00:30:27,676 --> 00:30:30,126
so you want to be a

700
00:30:30,126 --> 00:30:32,736
You should really clean up

701
00:30:33,126 --> 00:30:35,686
Specifically, you should

702
00:30:35,686 --> 00:30:39,416
to your users to see everything

703
00:30:39,416 --> 00:30:42,176
and allow them to delete things

704
00:30:44,196 --> 00:30:48,546
Remember that downloads that

705
00:30:48,686 --> 00:30:51,046
Now you can use those to

706
00:30:51,046 --> 00:30:51,916
at some point if you like.

707
00:30:52,236 --> 00:30:54,476
But if that's not what you

708
00:30:54,476 --> 00:30:58,016
to go ahead and delete those

709
00:30:59,116 --> 00:31:02,716
We're asking that you

710
00:30:59,116 --> 00:31:02,716
We're asking that you

711
00:31:02,716 --> 00:31:04,416
by explicit user actions.

712
00:31:04,416 --> 00:31:06,826
So you shouldn't just go ahead

713
00:31:06,826 --> 00:31:08,796
that your user might not

714
00:31:09,696 --> 00:31:12,096
We've gone ahead and taken

715
00:31:12,096 --> 00:31:14,246
out these downloads

716
00:31:15,956 --> 00:31:18,576
As I mentioned earlier,

717
00:31:18,576 --> 00:31:21,266
for the system to delete your

718
00:31:21,266 --> 00:31:22,416
in low disk space conditions.

719
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:25,366
Now this won't happen while

720
00:31:25,366 --> 00:31:29,806
This will only happen while

721
00:31:29,806 --> 00:31:32,966
After your app is launched, you

722
00:31:33,046 --> 00:31:35,856
about assuming whether you

723
00:31:35,856 --> 00:31:40,376
that you had previously

724
00:31:40,476 --> 00:31:43,976
You do not move your

725
00:31:43,976 --> 00:31:44,896
which we provide them to.

726
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:46,126
Again, it is very important

727
00:31:46,126 --> 00:31:48,606
that the system be able

728
00:31:50,146 --> 00:31:55,456
And finally, because these

729
00:31:55,546 --> 00:31:58,756
media selections that have not

730
00:31:58,756 --> 00:32:01,346
to mutate the asset that

731
00:31:58,756 --> 00:32:01,346
to mutate the asset that

732
00:32:01,556 --> 00:32:04,846
If you really must change,

733
00:32:04,846 --> 00:32:09,436
of a media playlist

734
00:32:09,436 --> 00:32:11,936
and mutate your master playlist,

735
00:32:11,936 --> 00:32:14,416
that modified asset

736
00:32:14,416 --> 00:32:15,996
than changing the one

737
00:32:17,506 --> 00:32:19,466
So, that's offline HLS.

738
00:32:19,606 --> 00:32:21,396
And we're really happy

739
00:32:21,396 --> 00:32:23,136
and excited to see you adopt it.

740
00:32:24,126 --> 00:32:26,196
So, in summary, we

741
00:32:26,196 --> 00:32:27,246
for you to use this year.

742
00:32:27,366 --> 00:32:30,096
We have our fragmented

743
00:32:30,496 --> 00:32:34,276
which will bring a

744
00:32:34,276 --> 00:32:37,326
across different platforms

745
00:32:38,036 --> 00:32:40,906
Remember that this is

746
00:32:40,906 --> 00:32:43,886
and requires minimal changes

747
00:32:45,156 --> 00:32:48,656
Next, we have our new

748
00:32:48,656 --> 00:32:49,656
DATERANGE tag.

749
00:32:49,726 --> 00:32:53,566
and this is just really

750
00:32:53,566 --> 00:32:56,706
with any live content that

751
00:32:56,966 --> 00:32:59,056
metadata, like ad boundaries

752
00:33:00,116 --> 00:33:03,466
And finally, we're giving

753
00:33:03,876 --> 00:33:07,716
So part of this we have a

754
00:33:07,816 --> 00:33:11,336
engine as well that you can

755
00:33:11,336 --> 00:33:12,286
and quality to download.
