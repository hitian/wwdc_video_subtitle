and he's wrapped in the

192
00:09:25,616 --> 00:09:27,816
in the face the leader

193
00:09:28,056 --> 00:09:29,526
that we are not at war with.

194
00:09:30,646 --> 00:09:31,896
What the hell are you doing?

195
00:09:31,976 --> 00:09:34,616
Now, it was at that

196
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:36,976
in from the sales department;

197
00:09:41,046 --> 00:09:41,666
Keep doing it [laughter].

198
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:46,376
It was an immediate

199
00:09:47,196 --> 00:09:48,956
Why? Because it was

200
00:09:49,856 --> 00:09:53,006
Jack and Joe were

201
00:09:53,006 --> 00:09:56,226
as their art form

202
00:09:57,046 --> 00:09:58,386
They were both Jewish.

203
00:09:59,026 --> 00:10:01,866
They had relatives and

204
00:09:59,026 --> 00:10:01,866
They had relatives and

205
00:10:02,336 --> 00:10:03,966
They knew what was going on.

206
00:10:04,976 --> 00:10:06,716
They knew about the ghettos.

207
00:10:06,796 --> 00:10:08,806
They knew about the work camps.

208
00:10:09,126 --> 00:10:11,716
They knew what the

209
00:10:12,566 --> 00:10:18,996
and they thought America should

210
00:10:19,206 --> 00:10:21,106
It's also important -- what

211
00:10:21,106 --> 00:10:22,106
What is he holding?

212
00:10:22,526 --> 00:10:23,616
Is it a bazooka?

213
00:10:24,056 --> 00:10:25,376
Is it a machine gun?

214
00:10:26,226 --> 00:10:27,056
No, it's a shield.

215
00:10:27,646 --> 00:10:30,976
Like I said, these

216
00:10:32,136 --> 00:10:33,196
They send messages.

217
00:10:33,296 --> 00:10:36,576
So, I think they chose a shield

218
00:10:36,576 --> 00:10:37,986
Well, it defends him.

219
00:10:37,986 --> 00:10:39,796
Look, it's blocking that bullet.

220
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:43,736
They're saying a message

221
00:10:43,736 --> 00:10:47,006
and America itself should

222
00:10:47,006 --> 00:10:49,486
that can't protect themselves.

223
00:10:49,876 --> 00:10:50,846
So, it was a big hit.

224
00:10:50,936 --> 00:10:52,306
But like I said, it

225
00:10:52,346 --> 00:10:55,446
because some felt we should

226
00:10:55,736 --> 00:10:57,986
And why are we -- why is

227
00:10:57,986 --> 00:10:59,256
of this nation?

228
00:10:59,876 --> 00:11:02,326
But they thought it was more

229
00:10:59,876 --> 00:11:02,326
But they thought it was more

230
00:11:03,086 --> 00:11:04,056
And that's not the last time

231
00:11:04,056 --> 00:11:07,756
that we've made statements

232
00:11:07,756 --> 00:11:10,836
So, here we have a cover

233
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:14,016
out just a year ago, but you

234
00:11:14,016 --> 00:11:14,726
in the suit, right?

235
00:11:14,896 --> 00:11:17,866
So, you see above the Captain

236
00:11:18,356 --> 00:11:21,066
The Falcon, who you may

237
00:11:21,066 --> 00:11:23,036
from Captain America

238
00:11:23,036 --> 00:11:24,276
Captain America Civil War.

239
00:11:24,276 --> 00:11:28,176
In the comic books

240
00:11:29,086 --> 00:11:31,266
In fact there was a time,

241
00:11:31,266 --> 00:11:34,606
where they changed the name

242
00:11:34,606 --> 00:11:37,246
from being Captain America to

243
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:41,526
And I know for me as a young

244
00:11:41,526 --> 00:11:45,396
and a black man, from

245
00:11:45,396 --> 00:11:48,176
working together, that

246
00:11:48,936 --> 00:11:50,136
So, we recently did a story

247
00:11:50,136 --> 00:11:53,896
where Steve's Super Soldier

248
00:11:54,576 --> 00:12:00,216
and he said to Sam, America

249
00:11:54,576 --> 00:12:00,216
and he said to Sam, America

250
00:12:00,576 --> 00:12:01,796
Will you take the shield?

251
00:12:02,766 --> 00:12:03,786
Will you take over for me?

252
00:12:04,756 --> 00:12:06,516
And we did -- and he said, yes.

253
00:12:06,796 --> 00:12:10,426
We published this, and of

254
00:12:10,456 --> 00:12:13,636
People were not happy,

255
00:12:14,136 --> 00:12:15,626
People feel -- why

256
00:12:15,696 --> 00:12:16,946
around with my character?

257
00:12:17,476 --> 00:12:18,386
You know, you're ruining them.

258
00:12:18,386 --> 00:12:19,586
Why are you changing thing?

259
00:12:20,146 --> 00:12:21,876
And we even get people

260
00:12:21,876 --> 00:12:23,886
why have you turned

261
00:12:24,696 --> 00:12:28,686
And we had to say, well we

262
00:12:28,686 --> 00:12:31,006
different -- make him

263
00:12:31,006 --> 00:12:34,346
This is actually Sam

264
00:12:34,756 --> 00:12:36,266
He's stood behind

265
00:12:36,266 --> 00:12:38,036
and with him, for decades.

266
00:12:38,036 --> 00:12:41,336
He deserves his chance

267
00:12:42,356 --> 00:12:44,486
Now why did we do this?

268
00:12:44,486 --> 00:12:47,206
Well, we like to try different

269
00:12:47,206 --> 00:12:49,556
and stretch the brand

270
00:12:49,696 --> 00:12:51,436
but we also like to say things.

271
00:12:52,006 --> 00:12:54,116
So, I'm just thinking

272
00:12:54,116 --> 00:12:56,246
and I don't know exactly what

273
00:12:56,246 --> 00:12:58,696
but I think perhaps

274
00:12:58,696 --> 00:13:02,126
that it doesn't matter what

275
00:12:58,696 --> 00:13:02,126
that it doesn't matter what

276
00:13:03,126 --> 00:13:04,216
if you have the heart.

277
00:13:04,766 --> 00:13:08,656
If you have the heart you

278
00:13:10,716 --> 00:13:14,236
My next friend, he

279
00:13:14,756 --> 00:13:18,706
He was from Queens as well.

280
00:13:18,706 --> 00:13:21,936
He was a bit of what

281
00:13:22,516 --> 00:13:24,766
He was picked on by the jocks.

282
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:27,536
See he was really into

283
00:13:28,266 --> 00:13:30,906
And he was an orphan

284
00:13:30,906 --> 00:13:33,246
by an older aunt and uncle.

285
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:36,006
And he really felt the

286
00:13:36,746 --> 00:13:39,616
And one day his uncle said

287
00:13:39,616 --> 00:13:42,476
up you're going to have a lot of

288
00:13:43,266 --> 00:13:44,286
So, when you do grow

289
00:13:44,286 --> 00:13:47,726
up you should use your

290
00:13:48,486 --> 00:13:50,746
And my friend kind

291
00:13:51,476 --> 00:13:54,986
And when he grew up and he was

292
00:13:55,076 --> 00:13:58,276
pretty smart and he did

293
00:13:58,706 --> 00:14:02,176
and one night he was out and

294
00:13:58,706 --> 00:14:02,176
and one night he was out and

295
00:14:02,176 --> 00:14:04,556
chasing a thief and the

296
00:14:04,556 --> 00:14:05,646
hey help me stop this thief.

297
00:14:06,106 --> 00:14:10,256
And my friend said, from now on

298
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:11,746
and he took a step back.

299
00:14:12,146 --> 00:14:13,366
And that thief ran by,

300
00:14:13,846 --> 00:14:16,266
and as fate would have it

301
00:14:16,326 --> 00:14:19,856
into my friend's uncle

302
00:14:20,306 --> 00:14:23,706
And my friend said, if only

303
00:14:23,706 --> 00:14:25,686
one of the only nice

304
00:14:26,186 --> 00:14:28,956
If I'd listened to him

305
00:14:29,336 --> 00:14:32,616
and my aunt wouldn't be

306
00:14:32,876 --> 00:14:36,796
And from that moment forward,

307
00:14:36,796 --> 00:14:39,706
he decided, I will use

308
00:14:40,206 --> 00:14:41,206
So, who am I talking about?

309
00:14:41,206 --> 00:14:44,096
My next friend -- Spider-Man!

310
00:14:44,356 --> 00:14:45,936
So, now it's 1963.

311
00:14:46,776 --> 00:14:48,286
I mention that because all

312
00:14:48,286 --> 00:14:50,356
of our creators were

313
00:14:50,356 --> 00:14:52,346
about what's going

314
00:14:52,476 --> 00:14:55,756
And this was really the birth

315
00:14:56,446 --> 00:14:57,726
And what do I mean by that?

316
00:14:57,726 --> 00:15:00,646
Well, Spider-Man looked

317
00:14:57,726 --> 00:15:00,646
Well, Spider-Man looked

318
00:15:00,936 --> 00:15:02,266
than heroes that came before.

319
00:15:02,486 --> 00:15:04,396
And once you start reading

320
00:15:04,396 --> 00:15:06,416
out he was truly different.

321
00:15:06,936 --> 00:15:11,346
And his creators, Stan Lee and

322
00:15:11,346 --> 00:15:13,186
at too when they came into work.

323
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:16,406
So, they came into work and

324
00:15:16,476 --> 00:15:18,096
said, what are you doing?

325
00:15:19,066 --> 00:15:24,726
You've published a comic with a

326
00:15:25,306 --> 00:15:27,696
and he has an insect

327
00:15:28,306 --> 00:15:29,796
Everybody hates bugs.

328
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:31,606
What are you doing?

329
00:15:31,736 --> 00:15:32,816
And you've covered his face.

330
00:15:32,816 --> 00:15:34,506
He looks like a bank robber.

331
00:15:34,506 --> 00:15:35,706
We can't see his face.

332
00:15:36,156 --> 00:15:38,526
And worst of all,

333
00:15:39,336 --> 00:15:41,016
Teenagers should be sidekicks.

334
00:15:41,516 --> 00:15:43,416
Who wants to read

335
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:45,646
Well, the new generation did.

336
00:15:46,476 --> 00:15:48,876
So, the greatest generation

337
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:50,106
It's 20 years later.

338
00:15:50,106 --> 00:15:52,266
It's the rise of

339
00:15:52,736 --> 00:15:54,096
They have disposable income.

340
00:15:54,436 --> 00:15:56,116
They want to read about

341
00:15:56,116 --> 00:15:58,056
They want to read about

342
00:15:58,716 --> 00:15:59,786
They want to read about heroes

343
00:15:59,786 --> 00:16:02,996
that are a little more

344
00:15:59,786 --> 00:16:02,996
that are a little more

345
00:16:03,326 --> 00:16:05,876
they're not square jawed

346
00:16:05,876 --> 00:16:08,836
or rich billionaires, they

347
00:16:08,836 --> 00:16:10,636
from Queens who gets picked on.

348
00:16:11,186 --> 00:16:14,466
But the publisher

349
00:16:14,856 --> 00:16:17,336
didn't know who was

350
00:16:17,336 --> 00:16:19,096
And so he's yelling

351
00:16:19,426 --> 00:16:20,576
what the hell are you doing?

352
00:16:22,156 --> 00:16:24,926
As you can guess, at that moment

353
00:16:25,226 --> 00:16:27,886
Boss, boss, look at

354
00:16:29,226 --> 00:16:30,926
Keep doing it!

355
00:16:31,556 --> 00:16:32,196
Another hit.

356
00:16:32,346 --> 00:16:36,406
And you can see what made

357
00:16:36,406 --> 00:16:40,576
I mean check out poor Peter

358
00:16:40,726 --> 00:16:43,946
and the glasses, and the kids

359
00:16:43,946 --> 00:16:48,166
at him, and as you can see, via

360
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:49,866
you see that he's ostracized.

361
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:51,326
He feels alone.

362
00:16:51,596 --> 00:16:52,826
He is an underdog.

363
00:16:53,276 --> 00:16:54,126
But look behind him.

364
00:16:55,006 --> 00:16:57,406
Look at the shadow

365
00:16:57,406 --> 00:17:01,456
And don't we all feel

366
00:16:57,406 --> 00:17:01,456
And don't we all feel

367
00:17:01,746 --> 00:17:03,866
We feel the world is against us.

368
00:17:03,866 --> 00:17:08,506
We feel the world is judging us,

369
00:17:08,955 --> 00:17:12,236
if given the opportunity,

370
00:17:14,356 --> 00:17:16,056
So, as with Captain America,

371
00:17:16,356 --> 00:17:17,965
Spider-Man was a

372
00:17:17,965 --> 00:17:19,496
when he came out,

373
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:20,536
They didn't get it.

374
00:17:20,715 --> 00:17:21,616
But many more did.

375
00:17:21,616 --> 00:17:25,476
And that wasn't the only

376
00:17:26,126 --> 00:17:27,665
that we did with him.

377
00:17:28,566 --> 00:17:33,886
Let's see, in 1970 the president

378
00:17:34,066 --> 00:17:38,036
believe it or not, went to Stan

379
00:17:38,426 --> 00:17:40,526
Stan we have this

380
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:43,266
And we're going to lose

381
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:47,466
And President Nixon knew

382
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:48,586
that Marvel were publishing.

383
00:17:48,586 --> 00:17:50,516
And he said, could

384
00:17:50,516 --> 00:17:53,526
that would mention

385
00:17:54,696 --> 00:17:56,636
Stan thought about it and he

386
00:17:56,636 --> 00:18:01,086
And what was remarkable

387
00:17:56,636 --> 00:18:01,086
And what was remarkable

388
00:18:01,086 --> 00:18:02,256
of Amazing Spider-Man.

389
00:18:02,766 --> 00:18:05,586
Now we had many characters

390
00:18:05,746 --> 00:18:07,206
Stan could have selected one

391
00:18:07,206 --> 00:18:09,036
of our less popular

392
00:18:09,596 --> 00:18:10,416
He picked Spider-Man.

393
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:12,666
Now, you'll see there's

394
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:14,036
on this cover.

395
00:18:14,596 --> 00:18:19,166
Now see up there on the top

396
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:20,986
That's the Comic's

397
00:18:21,496 --> 00:18:23,736
was a seal of approval

398
00:18:23,736 --> 00:18:26,836
that the comic was safe for

399
00:18:26,836 --> 00:18:29,166
it didn't have, you

400
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:31,396
of violence, things like that.

401
00:18:31,926 --> 00:18:34,426
What's not on this cover?

402
00:18:34,426 --> 00:18:35,386
There's no Comic's Code.

403
00:18:35,506 --> 00:18:37,516
See what happened was,

404
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:39,466
to publish it Stan

405
00:18:39,466 --> 00:18:42,356
to the Comic's Code Authority

406
00:18:42,356 --> 00:18:45,326
of approval and the Comic's Code

407
00:18:46,036 --> 00:18:47,296
Stan said, why not?

408
00:18:47,996 --> 00:18:49,496
He said because it

409
00:18:49,846 --> 00:18:52,826
Stan said, but it's not

410
00:18:52,826 --> 00:18:54,286
It's an antidrug story.

411
00:18:54,286 --> 00:18:55,246
And they said, we don't care.

412
00:18:55,866 --> 00:18:58,736
You -- the Comic's Code says

413
00:18:58,966 --> 00:19:01,356
in the comic, so you

414
00:18:58,966 --> 00:19:01,356
in the comic, so you

415
00:19:01,356 --> 00:19:03,366
with the Comic's Code

416
00:19:03,586 --> 00:19:06,766
And Stan said, good, we're

417
00:19:07,136 --> 00:19:08,006
without the Comic's Code.

418
00:19:09,136 --> 00:19:13,896
First time that happened,

419
00:19:14,706 --> 00:19:16,066
People really responded to it.

420
00:19:16,466 --> 00:19:21,036
They responded to, really kind

421
00:19:21,036 --> 00:19:23,906
In the story Peter's

422
00:19:23,906 --> 00:19:27,016
the son of the Green

423
00:19:27,776 --> 00:19:30,386
and Spider-Man had to council

424
00:19:30,386 --> 00:19:32,816
But they handled it in

425
00:19:32,816 --> 00:19:34,176
at the time could appreciate.

426
00:19:34,896 --> 00:19:37,606
Stan was really speaking to

427
00:19:37,606 --> 00:19:38,526
that they wanted to hear.

428
00:19:39,366 --> 00:19:42,016
But, as you can guess, it

429
00:19:42,016 --> 00:19:43,996
but sometimes we've

430
00:19:44,036 --> 00:19:47,296
Right? We have to use

431
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:50,066
But it didn't stop

432
00:19:50,066 --> 00:19:54,196
No. We use Spider-Man

433
00:19:54,496 --> 00:19:55,496
to speak to other things.

434
00:19:55,496 --> 00:19:58,696
So, in this case it was

435
00:19:58,696 --> 00:20:01,926
of comics called The Ultimate

436
00:19:58,696 --> 00:20:01,926
of comics called The Ultimate

437
00:20:01,926 --> 00:20:03,926
They were set on another

438
00:20:03,926 --> 00:20:05,626
of started -- we started now.

439
00:20:06,066 --> 00:20:08,006
Rather than having our

440
00:20:08,006 --> 00:20:09,366
we kind of started

441
00:20:09,366 --> 00:20:10,646
but wanted to make it different.

442
00:20:10,706 --> 00:20:12,356
We wanted to make it unexpected.

443
00:20:12,356 --> 00:20:16,726
And so actually on that

444
00:20:16,936 --> 00:20:20,926
in battle protecting Aunt

445
00:20:21,326 --> 00:20:25,466
And in that reality there was

446
00:20:26,216 --> 00:20:30,126
who happened to also be

447
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:33,776
And when that world's Peter

448
00:20:33,776 --> 00:20:35,556
world still needs a Spider-Man.

449
00:20:35,556 --> 00:20:37,886
So, he made his own

450
00:20:38,146 --> 00:20:41,316
that world's Spider-Man.

451
00:20:41,596 --> 00:20:44,586
And, as you can see, looks a

452
00:20:44,986 --> 00:20:47,346
He's half African American,

453
00:20:47,686 --> 00:20:52,926
And I remember the day I came

454
00:20:53,086 --> 00:20:54,536
at the time for Marvel

455
00:20:54,886 --> 00:20:56,366
An editor is sort

456
00:20:57,226 --> 00:20:59,746
we're selecting the writers

457
00:20:59,746 --> 00:21:02,056
on the series, and we're working

458
00:20:59,746 --> 00:21:02,056
on the series, and we're working

459
00:21:02,056 --> 00:21:04,626
of the way, deciding

460
00:21:04,626 --> 00:21:06,396
to what's in the word balloons.

461
00:21:06,396 --> 00:21:07,266
We work on everything.

462
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,136
And we also have access

463
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:13,216
to an email account

464
00:21:13,626 --> 00:21:15,126
and people can write in letters.

465
00:21:15,976 --> 00:21:17,616
Usually they write in and say,

466
00:21:18,316 --> 00:21:20,406
why can't Peter Parker

467
00:21:20,406 --> 00:21:22,306
be happily married ever after?

468
00:21:22,726 --> 00:21:25,376
Why can't Rogue and

469
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:26,926
Why are you so cruel to them?

470
00:21:27,966 --> 00:21:29,656
Because drama, that's why.

471
00:21:32,126 --> 00:21:32,636
So, that --

472
00:21:33,516 --> 00:21:36,716
[ Applause ]

473
00:21:37,216 --> 00:21:40,166
So, I remember I came

474
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:42,766
and that email account

475
00:21:43,336 --> 00:21:45,316
And some of them weren't happy.

476
00:21:46,316 --> 00:21:49,356
One was from a dad, I'll never

477
00:21:49,356 --> 00:21:54,846
when my kids get home from

478
00:21:54,846 --> 00:21:57,006
to the backyard and

479
00:21:57,006 --> 00:21:59,256
up all their Spider-Man comics

480
00:21:59,766 --> 00:22:04,316
He said, why did you make -- why

481
00:21:59,766 --> 00:22:04,316
He said, why did you make -- why

482
00:22:04,946 --> 00:22:05,836
Why did you do this?

483
00:22:05,836 --> 00:22:10,126
Why with your East

484
00:22:10,806 --> 00:22:13,296
Why are you ruining our hero?

485
00:22:14,586 --> 00:22:17,126
So, I wrote to him and I

486
00:22:17,126 --> 00:22:21,396
to buy a single additional

487
00:22:22,516 --> 00:22:24,176
but just so you know,

488
00:22:24,836 --> 00:22:27,866
in the regular Marvel Universe

489
00:22:28,406 --> 00:22:31,776
But we're offering an

490
00:22:31,776 --> 00:22:32,706
that looks a bit different.

491
00:22:33,406 --> 00:22:35,986
So, I said, you don't have

492
00:22:36,046 --> 00:22:40,156
but please don't burn

493
00:22:41,246 --> 00:22:44,816
It will not have the effect on

494
00:22:45,076 --> 00:22:47,256
It will be far, far worse.

495
00:22:48,016 --> 00:22:48,726
Now he didn't respond.

496
00:22:48,726 --> 00:22:49,926
I don't know if he

497
00:22:49,926 --> 00:22:51,366
I'd like to hope he didn't.

498
00:22:52,006 --> 00:22:54,176
Who can say?

499
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:56,576
But I can say, immediately

500
00:22:56,576 --> 00:22:57,596
that I read a great letter.

501
00:22:58,896 --> 00:23:01,126
A young woman wrote in

502
00:22:58,896 --> 00:23:01,126
A young woman wrote in

503
00:23:01,716 --> 00:23:07,136
She says, now my little brother

504
00:23:07,136 --> 00:23:10,716
like him, and he feels great.

505
00:23:11,856 --> 00:23:16,366
He feels he is represented

506
00:23:17,296 --> 00:23:17,946
And that's why we do it.

507
00:23:18,516 --> 00:23:25,556
[ Applause ]

508
00:23:26,056 --> 00:23:28,226
Alright, my next

509
00:23:29,126 --> 00:23:31,116
Oh, he really loved his dad.

510
00:23:31,926 --> 00:23:35,236
His dad led this --

511
00:23:35,236 --> 00:23:36,716
like an empire, you could say.

512
00:23:37,506 --> 00:23:39,686
My friend really -- he

513
00:23:39,686 --> 00:23:41,246
to one day take over for him.

514
00:23:42,366 --> 00:23:46,116
And as fate would have

515
00:23:46,576 --> 00:23:51,206
and my friend did have to step

516
00:23:51,206 --> 00:23:54,136
And he found it was so much more

517
00:23:54,606 --> 00:23:57,356
and he realized it was

518
00:23:57,756 --> 00:23:59,606
by others outside of it.

519
00:23:59,606 --> 00:24:02,956
And he had to find the

520
00:23:59,606 --> 00:24:02,956
And he had to find the

521
00:24:02,956 --> 00:24:06,196
into the boots of his father,

522
00:24:06,616 --> 00:24:10,156
I'm talking about

523
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:12,746
who many of you may

524
00:24:12,746 --> 00:24:15,546
to in the latest Captain

525
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:18,686
So, Black Panther was

526
00:24:18,686 --> 00:24:21,126
of The Fantastic Four, 1966.

527
00:24:21,406 --> 00:24:26,506
And it was remarkable because

528
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:29,326
introduced by one of the

529
00:24:30,346 --> 00:24:34,386
And what's also crazy cool is

530
00:24:34,876 --> 00:24:36,346
He was no one's servant.

531
00:24:36,846 --> 00:24:40,136
When the Fantastic Four

532
00:24:40,136 --> 00:24:43,876
to his nation of Wakanda,

533
00:24:43,876 --> 00:24:45,676
up that was in Africa.

534
00:24:46,136 --> 00:24:51,066
They saw that he was a king,

535
00:24:51,066 --> 00:24:53,186
that was the world's

536
00:24:53,186 --> 00:24:54,706
advanced country.

537
00:24:55,626 --> 00:24:58,766
And so again, I think the

538
00:24:58,766 --> 00:25:00,466
and Jack Kirby, were

539
00:24:58,766 --> 00:25:00,466
and Jack Kirby, were

540
00:25:01,346 --> 00:25:05,206
Were making a statement just in

541
00:25:05,726 --> 00:25:09,596
And people loved Black

542
00:25:09,596 --> 00:25:13,956
And they were very smart in

543
00:25:13,956 --> 00:25:17,356
and I think they told some

544
00:25:17,356 --> 00:25:18,716
like this next cover.

545
00:25:19,286 --> 00:25:21,946
So, here we are in

546
00:25:21,946 --> 00:25:23,886
Black Panther is

547
00:25:25,306 --> 00:25:29,306
He's actually ripping himself

548
00:25:29,306 --> 00:25:30,226
on fire.

549
00:25:30,756 --> 00:25:36,286
What an emotional,

550
00:25:36,616 --> 00:25:39,856
One of the things I love about

551
00:25:40,456 --> 00:25:43,176
I love that they chose, not

552
00:25:43,176 --> 00:25:44,966
at the bottom, but there's

553
00:25:45,596 --> 00:25:47,966
This always -- this again

554
00:25:47,966 --> 00:25:50,766
of underdogs feeling

555
00:25:50,896 --> 00:25:54,616
feeling the world is against

556
00:25:54,616 --> 00:25:57,766
deciding to do the

557
00:25:58,636 --> 00:26:04,236
My next friend, she

558
00:25:58,636 --> 00:26:04,236
My next friend, she

559
00:26:04,236 --> 00:26:06,186
I think I should stop

560
00:26:06,446 --> 00:26:10,626
what's up with all the orphans?

561
00:26:10,726 --> 00:26:14,256
Well, in any sort of art form

562
00:26:14,926 --> 00:26:16,936
especially in fiction --

563
00:26:17,136 --> 00:26:20,086
on the side of your character,

564
00:26:20,156 --> 00:26:24,206
say a limited page count of a

565
00:26:24,246 --> 00:26:26,016
in a movie or in a video game,

566
00:26:26,016 --> 00:26:27,776
you have to make

567
00:26:27,776 --> 00:26:30,636
that helps your audience

568
00:26:30,636 --> 00:26:33,386
So, that's why you -- it's a

569
00:26:33,686 --> 00:26:38,006
all these orphans; Luke

570
00:26:38,866 --> 00:26:43,486
every Disney princess,

571
00:26:43,486 --> 00:26:48,696
There goes mama [laughter]

572
00:26:49,856 --> 00:26:50,906
Why do we do this?

573
00:26:50,906 --> 00:26:52,746
Because again, we're

574
00:26:52,746 --> 00:26:53,866
on the side of the hero.

575
00:26:53,866 --> 00:26:57,226
And what's the one thing that

576
00:26:58,306 --> 00:27:00,466
or if it's unfortunate enough

577
00:26:58,306 --> 00:27:00,466
or if it's unfortunate enough

578
00:27:00,466 --> 00:27:03,126
to sympathize with,

579
00:27:03,706 --> 00:27:05,076
something everyone can fear.

580
00:27:05,476 --> 00:27:07,226
So, it gets your audience

581
00:27:07,226 --> 00:27:09,996
It also literally forces the

582
00:27:10,296 --> 00:27:13,256
Our characters must now

583
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:16,236
and again make their choices

584
00:27:16,236 --> 00:27:19,946
So, that's why you often see

585
00:27:19,946 --> 00:27:22,846
So, my next friend;

586
00:27:23,106 --> 00:27:24,316
and she felt like a freak.

587
00:27:25,556 --> 00:27:28,766
She was like this friend,

588
00:27:29,406 --> 00:27:32,606
and she had silver hair.

589
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:36,056
She was black but she had

590
00:27:36,146 --> 00:27:40,486
like everyone was judging

591
00:27:40,486 --> 00:27:42,786
and thinking she was some

592
00:27:43,186 --> 00:27:48,486
And one day this really nice

593
00:27:48,486 --> 00:27:50,196
you're not cursed,

594
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:55,636
I want you to come with me

595
00:27:57,006 --> 00:28:00,446
where everyone looks really

596
00:27:57,006 --> 00:28:00,446
where everyone looks really

597
00:28:00,446 --> 00:28:03,196
to fly around in, and together

598
00:28:03,196 --> 00:28:05,586
and we're going to show

599
00:28:05,586 --> 00:28:07,006
like you are not evil.

600
00:28:07,276 --> 00:28:08,866
That people like you are good.

601
00:28:09,096 --> 00:28:12,356
And we can all work together

602
00:28:12,656 --> 00:28:14,506
So, can you guess

603
00:28:15,226 --> 00:28:17,516
Storm! Storm, a mutant.

604
00:28:17,516 --> 00:28:20,746
In the Marvel universe we

605
00:28:20,746 --> 00:28:21,836
by how they get their powers.

606
00:28:22,246 --> 00:28:24,406
So, if you get bitten

607
00:28:24,406 --> 00:28:27,106
or if it's cosmic rays,

608
00:28:27,536 --> 00:28:30,896
the creators were really

609
00:28:30,896 --> 00:28:32,496
at the time, and the

610
00:28:32,496 --> 00:28:36,096
That's why there's all this

611
00:28:36,496 --> 00:28:39,326
But if you're a mutant you

612
00:28:39,756 --> 00:28:41,196
it's in your genes

613
00:28:41,196 --> 00:28:43,606
and when you hit puberty, ta da!

614
00:28:43,606 --> 00:28:48,036
You're body starts changing,

615
00:28:48,036 --> 00:28:50,886
you grow wings, lasers

616
00:28:50,886 --> 00:28:51,906
And isn't that what you felt

617
00:28:51,906 --> 00:28:53,356
like when you were

618
00:28:54,146 --> 00:28:56,886
I did. And so the

619
00:28:56,886 --> 00:28:58,386
about is Professor X, right?

620
00:28:58,386 --> 00:29:00,556
And so he comes up to

621
00:28:58,386 --> 00:29:00,556
And so he comes up to

622
00:29:00,556 --> 00:29:03,106
come with me and we're

623
00:29:03,106 --> 00:29:05,696
We're going to show the world

624
00:29:05,696 --> 00:29:07,506
and work together

625
00:29:07,506 --> 00:29:09,236
And it's a great message.

626
00:29:09,446 --> 00:29:11,266
And another message

627
00:29:12,296 --> 00:29:14,336
I've mentioned America a

628
00:29:14,696 --> 00:29:17,866
And super humans are a

629
00:29:18,236 --> 00:29:20,526
We came up with them and I

630
00:29:20,526 --> 00:29:24,736
and you could say right now

631
00:29:24,736 --> 00:29:27,266
to the world is the super hero.

632
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:29,616
We export the super

633
00:29:30,046 --> 00:29:32,976
But this issue was different.

634
00:29:33,036 --> 00:29:36,596
This issue introduced

635
00:29:37,496 --> 00:29:39,966
So, you have Storm

636
00:29:40,166 --> 00:29:43,286
The big metal guy is

637
00:29:44,166 --> 00:29:46,166
And to me, as a kid,

638
00:29:46,716 --> 00:29:51,196
My mom was Ukrainian, and so I

639
00:29:51,196 --> 00:29:52,796
you know anyone from

640
00:29:52,796 --> 00:29:53,896
and anywhere near Russia was,

641
00:29:54,116 --> 00:29:56,156
you know those were

642
00:29:56,156 --> 00:29:59,806
But in the comics I saw that,

643
00:29:59,866 --> 00:30:01,036
Colossus is a hero.

644
00:29:59,866 --> 00:30:01,036
Colossus is a hero.

645
00:30:01,086 --> 00:30:02,586
It meant a lot to me.

646
00:30:02,956 --> 00:30:06,136
So, also you see Nightcrawler,

647
00:30:06,376 --> 00:30:09,126
Wolverine, with the

648
00:30:10,906 --> 00:30:11,566
True story.

649
00:30:13,286 --> 00:30:14,066
International group.

650
00:30:14,406 --> 00:30:18,326
Again, I think they were making

651
00:30:18,436 --> 00:30:20,406
again, it doesn't

652
00:30:20,406 --> 00:30:23,876
or where you come from,

653
00:30:23,956 --> 00:30:24,816
We can all be heroes.

654
00:30:25,066 --> 00:30:26,316
And storm was really unique

655
00:30:26,316 --> 00:30:29,466
because she wasn't only

656
00:30:29,686 --> 00:30:31,936
she can control the weather,

657
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:33,056
and lightning and storm.

658
00:30:33,446 --> 00:30:37,316
Not only that, but she had

659
00:30:37,316 --> 00:30:38,436
I mean look at this next cover.

660
00:30:38,966 --> 00:30:41,046
That's her rocking

661
00:30:41,076 --> 00:30:43,226
with the mohawk and the leather.

662
00:30:43,476 --> 00:30:45,096
And she was saying to the

663
00:30:45,446 --> 00:30:47,486
Love me or hate me,

664
00:30:47,486 --> 00:30:49,476
Now, this issue was significant

665
00:30:49,476 --> 00:30:52,836
because she actually challenged

666
00:30:52,836 --> 00:30:56,506
of the X-Men, and she did it

667
00:30:57,176 --> 00:30:59,756
by a gun and she didn't

668
00:31:00,636 --> 00:31:03,596
But she was very smart

669
00:31:03,956 --> 00:31:05,806
and she beat Cyclops.

670
00:31:07,086 --> 00:31:09,666
So, here I am, this white kid.

671
00:31:09,666 --> 00:31:12,346
At the time I was living

672
00:31:12,736 --> 00:31:16,866
and I read a comic book where a

673
00:31:17,106 --> 00:31:21,466
for leadership of Marvel's most

674
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:25,546
And you know what I said, and

675
00:31:26,036 --> 00:31:26,796
We said, alright!

676
00:31:27,496 --> 00:31:29,336
Cool! She's earned it.

677
00:31:29,766 --> 00:31:32,466
So, I think stories like this,

678
00:31:32,466 --> 00:31:34,616
and images like this,

679
00:31:35,326 --> 00:31:38,736
And Storm isn't the only

680
00:31:38,736 --> 00:31:41,076
We actually have a

681
00:31:41,276 --> 00:31:44,246
In the movies you've seen Black

682
00:31:44,246 --> 00:31:45,316
we announced we're finally going

683
00:31:45,316 --> 00:31:47,626
to do a female solo

684
00:31:47,996 --> 00:31:51,506
We have a history of

685
00:31:51,506 --> 00:31:53,686
like to celebrate them.

686
00:31:53,686 --> 00:31:56,346
So, this year we did an

687
00:31:56,346 --> 00:31:59,126
We were going to -- it

688
00:31:59,126 --> 00:32:01,326
to International

689
00:31:59,126 --> 00:32:01,326
to International

690
00:32:01,326 --> 00:32:03,226
And so we said, let's do a

691
00:32:03,576 --> 00:32:05,636
So, up top you see these images.

692
00:32:06,256 --> 00:32:07,796
We created these covers.

693
00:32:07,886 --> 00:32:10,576
We created 24 different

694
00:32:10,576 --> 00:32:11,656
to go on our comic books.

695
00:32:11,656 --> 00:32:14,506
And I knew we were doing

696
00:32:14,886 --> 00:32:16,596
So, I called up my

697
00:32:16,596 --> 00:32:19,586
because at this point I'm now --

698
00:32:19,586 --> 00:32:21,716
for the Marvel Games team

699
00:32:21,716 --> 00:32:23,806
and I said, hey, let's team up.

700
00:32:23,806 --> 00:32:26,856
I want to do women of

701
00:32:26,856 --> 00:32:28,136
And they said, well how

702
00:32:28,136 --> 00:32:31,376
I said, I'm going to call all

703
00:32:31,806 --> 00:32:35,126
who create all of our mobile

704
00:32:35,396 --> 00:32:36,396
if they want to participate.

705
00:32:36,396 --> 00:32:39,116
I'm going to say, hey do you

706
00:32:39,426 --> 00:32:40,746
that you were going to

707
00:32:40,746 --> 00:32:44,726
Do you want to hold

708
00:32:44,916 --> 00:32:47,566
And everyone whose logo

709
00:32:47,566 --> 00:32:50,426
And so we did the Women

710
00:32:50,746 --> 00:32:52,716
It was covered by

711
00:32:52,716 --> 00:32:54,116
and then Forbes picked it up.

712
00:32:54,986 --> 00:32:57,756
And it was a way for

713
00:32:57,756 --> 00:32:59,296
without even saying anything.

714
00:32:59,586 --> 00:33:01,646
See, at the time,

715
00:32:59,586 --> 00:33:01,646
See, at the time,

716
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:04,116
of Gamer Gate was in the news.

717
00:33:04,116 --> 00:33:06,066
And people were asking me, what

718
00:33:06,066 --> 00:33:07,906
And I said, what do I think?

719
00:33:07,966 --> 00:33:10,226
I -- we love our female readers.

720
00:33:10,786 --> 00:33:12,286
We love our female characters.

721
00:33:12,736 --> 00:33:16,536
We love our -- most of

722
00:33:16,886 --> 00:33:20,776
We want to invite

723
00:33:21,876 --> 00:33:24,886
And that's what the Women

724
00:33:24,886 --> 00:33:27,226
And that's what it

725
00:33:27,226 --> 00:33:28,486
to make a statement on it.

726
00:33:29,256 --> 00:33:29,976
My last-- Yes!

727
00:33:30,516 --> 00:33:36,096
[ Applause ]

728
00:33:36,596 --> 00:33:37,736
Let's see, my next friend --

729
00:33:38,406 --> 00:33:39,746
I lied a bit, it's

730
00:33:39,746 --> 00:33:40,676
It's a group of friends,

731
00:33:40,676 --> 00:33:44,176
but they're so united

732
00:33:44,766 --> 00:33:48,546
These friends, like my

733
00:33:48,546 --> 00:33:50,816
in some way, and

734
00:33:50,816 --> 00:33:52,266
and they felt like misfits.

735
00:33:52,776 --> 00:33:54,866
But they ran into each

736
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:55,916
and they said, you know what?

737
00:33:55,916 --> 00:33:57,066
You're my kind of misfit.

738
00:33:57,496 --> 00:33:59,986
And they formed a

739
00:33:59,986 --> 00:34:02,806
and they were all very

740
00:33:59,986 --> 00:34:02,806
and they were all very

741
00:34:02,806 --> 00:34:04,866
you know despite our differences

742
00:34:04,866 --> 00:34:07,236
and we can save,

743
00:34:07,236 --> 00:34:09,755
we can save the entire galaxy.

744
00:34:10,726 --> 00:34:13,386
My next friends, The

745
00:34:14,746 --> 00:34:15,775
Now this -- Yeah!

746
00:34:16,786 --> 00:34:20,096
Yes, that's a talking

747
00:34:20,096 --> 00:34:21,306
that does deserve applause!

748
00:34:23,456 --> 00:34:28,536
So, this cover that came out in

749
00:34:28,536 --> 00:34:29,936
of the series at the time.

750
00:34:30,216 --> 00:34:32,416
I was asked to edit

751
00:34:32,676 --> 00:34:34,235
and I wanted to do a team book.

752
00:34:34,815 --> 00:34:37,255
I had a book that was a

753
00:34:37,326 --> 00:34:40,886
And I said, well now I want to

754
00:34:40,886 --> 00:34:44,376
you know the freaks and geeks

755
00:34:44,376 --> 00:34:46,735
I want it to be a

756
00:34:47,456 --> 00:34:49,906
And then I got this name,

757
00:34:50,005 --> 00:34:52,176
There was a team in

758
00:34:52,176 --> 00:34:54,585
And we hadn't used that

759
00:34:54,585 --> 00:34:56,626
And I'm like, I want to use

760
00:34:56,626 --> 00:34:59,216
You hear it and you know

761
00:34:59,216 --> 00:35:00,856
they guard the galaxy.

762
00:34:59,216 --> 00:35:00,856
they guard the galaxy.

763
00:35:01,486 --> 00:35:04,836
So, one night I have

764
00:35:04,836 --> 00:35:07,456
of the Marvel Universe, they're

765
00:35:07,536 --> 00:35:09,066
And they -- with

766
00:35:09,066 --> 00:35:11,766
And I have them open, and

767
00:35:11,766 --> 00:35:14,536
and I'm going through and I'm

768
00:35:14,536 --> 00:35:16,966
that I remember from

769
00:35:16,966 --> 00:35:18,316
but we haven't seen

770
00:35:18,566 --> 00:35:21,096
So, I'm putting sticky

771
00:35:21,096 --> 00:35:23,356
and I have them spread

772
00:35:23,586 --> 00:35:26,986
And my wife comes in and she

773
00:35:26,986 --> 00:35:28,086
You're making a mess!

774
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:31,746
I said, honey, I'm building

775
00:35:32,106 --> 00:35:33,606
and this is going

776
00:35:34,476 --> 00:35:37,566
And I show her a page and

777
00:35:37,566 --> 00:35:39,196
And I said, it's a raccoon!

778
00:35:40,746 --> 00:35:42,706
Back in the 80s there was

779
00:35:42,706 --> 00:35:44,696
Raccoon that I thought

780
00:35:45,086 --> 00:35:48,506
I mean it was a raccoon with

781
00:35:48,506 --> 00:35:50,596
and a bad attitude, and

782
00:35:51,076 --> 00:35:53,806
And I thought if we just

783
00:35:54,066 --> 00:35:55,266
then the world will love him.

784
00:35:55,506 --> 00:35:57,496
And I just continued

785
00:35:57,496 --> 00:35:59,556
and I found all these

786
00:35:59,556 --> 00:36:05,356
Groot, a walking tree and Drax,

787
00:35:59,556 --> 00:36:05,356
Groot, a walking tree and Drax,

788
00:36:05,356 --> 00:36:08,816
but not too smart assassin, and

789
00:36:08,816 --> 00:36:12,266
in the galaxy, and that's

790
00:36:12,646 --> 00:36:16,676
And it didn't have a huge

791
00:36:16,676 --> 00:36:18,386
that read the comic

792
00:36:18,386 --> 00:36:20,756
And I remember one

793
00:36:21,706 --> 00:36:25,066
Hello. It's a friend over on the

794
00:36:25,826 --> 00:36:27,376
the crew here in Marvel Studios,

795
00:36:27,846 --> 00:36:30,056
we really like your

796
00:36:30,056 --> 00:36:31,556
especially Guardians

797
00:36:31,816 --> 00:36:33,446
I'm like, that's cool.

798
00:36:33,446 --> 00:36:35,176
Cool bud, I'm glad you like it.

799
00:36:35,176 --> 00:36:37,906
No, no, we really like it!

800
00:36:37,906 --> 00:36:39,906
So, what does that mean?

801
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:41,056
Can't tell you, bye.

802
00:36:44,686 --> 00:36:46,166
Click. Well, what do

803
00:36:47,296 --> 00:36:48,286
The movie poster.

804
00:36:48,836 --> 00:36:52,786
And I said, that's

805
00:36:54,366 --> 00:36:56,366
They made it about our team!

806
00:36:56,726 --> 00:36:58,756
And it was remarked

807
00:36:58,756 --> 00:37:02,246
and of course it was great,

808
00:36:58,756 --> 00:37:02,246
and of course it was great,

809
00:37:02,246 --> 00:37:05,246
and the director, James Gunn,

810
00:37:05,536 --> 00:37:08,686
it was awesome and --

811
00:37:08,686 --> 00:37:11,706
about it was the

812
00:37:11,706 --> 00:37:12,806
for a Marvel Studios movie.

813
00:37:12,806 --> 00:37:16,036
Usually we look back, if

814
00:37:16,116 --> 00:37:19,316
and Captain America, we look

815
00:37:19,316 --> 00:37:21,996
in the 60s and even

816
00:37:21,996 --> 00:37:23,836
and we base the stories on that.

817
00:37:23,836 --> 00:37:25,406
But they were basing

818
00:37:25,456 --> 00:37:26,686
from just a few years ago.

819
00:37:27,116 --> 00:37:30,136
And it was characters that

820
00:37:30,136 --> 00:37:31,426
When you see the

821
00:37:31,426 --> 00:37:34,766
and assume these are new created

822
00:37:34,766 --> 00:37:35,706
They're decades old.

823
00:37:35,706 --> 00:37:37,336
They're from the 80s and the 70s

824
00:37:37,536 --> 00:37:39,016
and even the 60s

825
00:37:39,286 --> 00:37:40,046
And they're crazy.

826
00:37:40,046 --> 00:37:40,916
They're freaky, right?

827
00:37:40,916 --> 00:37:42,816
They're -- it's like

828
00:37:42,816 --> 00:37:44,706
And people are like,

829
00:37:44,706 --> 00:37:45,906
I remember the headlines;

830
00:37:45,906 --> 00:37:47,516
to be Marvel's first flop!

831
00:37:47,516 --> 00:37:48,606
I said, no it's not!

832
00:37:48,606 --> 00:37:49,686
It's going to be great!

833
00:37:50,276 --> 00:37:51,746
And the reason it was a hit,

834
00:37:52,366 --> 00:37:55,206
even though the characters

835
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:57,836
in space, they grounded

836
00:37:57,836 --> 00:38:01,576
It was all about family

837
00:37:57,836 --> 00:38:01,576
It was all about family

838
00:38:01,576 --> 00:38:04,086
when Peter Quill is

839
00:38:04,446 --> 00:38:07,806
all through the movie, when you

840
00:38:07,806 --> 00:38:09,736
talk about how they feel

841
00:38:09,736 --> 00:38:12,706
of their kind, or in Drax

842
00:38:13,066 --> 00:38:15,916
They were all alone, but they

843
00:38:16,146 --> 00:38:18,126
we will be each other's

844
00:38:18,806 --> 00:38:21,816
Groot goes from I am

845
00:38:22,236 --> 00:38:23,906
That was the message.

846
00:38:24,216 --> 00:38:27,656
And I think everyone, in one way

847
00:38:27,976 --> 00:38:31,016
As we grow up we often

848
00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:32,496
We leave our family.

849
00:38:32,726 --> 00:38:33,846
We go to school.

850
00:38:33,946 --> 00:38:35,006
We get jobs.

851
00:38:35,496 --> 00:38:36,116
What do we do?

852
00:38:36,116 --> 00:38:37,076
We look around.

853
00:38:37,076 --> 00:38:39,116
We find other misfits

854
00:38:39,116 --> 00:38:40,916
and we form new families.

855
00:38:41,296 --> 00:38:43,826
I think that's what is at

856
00:38:43,826 --> 00:38:46,796
in every scene and that's why

857
00:38:47,636 --> 00:38:50,956
Alright, I have one more

858
00:38:50,956 --> 00:38:57,156
And he is not on this cover, but

859
00:38:57,156 --> 00:39:00,176
Let's see, so there I was,

860
00:38:57,156 --> 00:39:00,176
Let's see, so there I was,

861
00:39:00,176 --> 00:39:03,466
at work when I was

862
00:39:03,736 --> 00:39:06,446
And it was a February

863
00:39:06,446 --> 00:39:09,526
and I had walked 20 minutes from

864
00:39:10,086 --> 00:39:13,706
And my phone's ringing and I

865
00:39:13,706 --> 00:39:16,016
in 20 minutes and I

866
00:39:16,016 --> 00:39:17,176
and I look at my emails.

867
00:39:17,176 --> 00:39:19,066
And there's a wall,

868
00:39:19,766 --> 00:39:22,316
And some of them were, like

869
00:39:22,386 --> 00:39:24,646
mheroes@marvel.com,

870
00:39:25,056 --> 00:39:26,216
And some of them were again,

871
00:39:26,216 --> 00:39:28,646
saying how they loved some

872
00:39:28,916 --> 00:39:31,336
And one subject line

873
00:39:31,336 --> 00:39:35,476
That got my attention

874
00:39:35,986 --> 00:39:38,776
And it was not a letter

875
00:39:38,776 --> 00:39:40,576
and Gambit or Peter

876
00:39:40,576 --> 00:39:42,416
No, it was from a

877
00:39:43,866 --> 00:39:45,906
She said, I need your help.

878
00:39:46,776 --> 00:39:50,616
Said, my little boy Anthony,

879
00:39:51,386 --> 00:39:54,166
this morning he did not want

880
00:39:55,116 --> 00:39:57,066
We call it blue ear because

881
00:39:57,396 --> 00:39:59,686
He said, mama, I'm

882
00:40:00,466 --> 00:40:01,456
And I said, why not?

883
00:40:01,656 --> 00:40:05,266
And he said, because super

884
00:40:06,416 --> 00:40:10,676
So, Anthony at that age,

885
00:40:11,846 --> 00:40:14,926
So, Christina tells me

886
00:40:14,926 --> 00:40:16,476
Super heroes where hearing aids.

887
00:40:16,476 --> 00:40:19,826
And he said, you mean

888
00:40:20,216 --> 00:40:21,576
And she said, yes of course.

889
00:40:21,576 --> 00:40:23,926
And he said, well

890
00:40:23,926 --> 00:40:26,586
She said, I'll tell you when

891
00:40:26,586 --> 00:40:30,196
She drives Anthony to school.

892
00:40:30,476 --> 00:40:32,346
Runs back.

893
00:40:33,036 --> 00:40:34,636
Help! Oh, what am I

894
00:40:35,006 --> 00:40:37,066
I don't know if any super

895
00:40:37,066 --> 00:40:38,986
and he can't know

896
00:40:40,096 --> 00:40:42,306
But I have faith, I think

897
00:40:42,306 --> 00:40:43,436
I'm not a liar right?

898
00:40:43,786 --> 00:40:46,686
So, there I am, and the

899
00:40:46,686 --> 00:40:47,946
And I go to the meeting.

900
00:40:48,136 --> 00:40:53,116
And my finger is going to the

901
00:40:53,456 --> 00:40:56,096
and I said, what

902
00:40:58,156 --> 00:40:59,176
Catholic guilt!

903
00:40:59,886 --> 00:41:02,206
What would he do?

904
00:40:59,886 --> 00:41:02,206
What would he do?

905
00:41:03,026 --> 00:41:04,806
But that is seriously

906
00:41:04,806 --> 00:41:05,556
when I was growing up.

907
00:41:05,556 --> 00:41:06,846
I didn't really want

908
00:41:06,846 --> 00:41:07,926
I wanted to be Peter Parker.

909
00:41:08,566 --> 00:41:11,246
Because even though he wasn't

910
00:41:11,246 --> 00:41:12,896
to do the right thing.

911
00:41:13,676 --> 00:41:15,686
So, I said, okay, power

912
00:41:15,996 --> 00:41:16,586
What can I do?

913
00:41:16,716 --> 00:41:17,886
Well, I don't have

914
00:41:17,886 --> 00:41:20,126
but I have information

915
00:41:20,126 --> 00:41:21,856
And I have access to images.

916
00:41:21,856 --> 00:41:22,306
I have that.

917
00:41:22,826 --> 00:41:23,846
So, what's my responsibility?

918
00:41:23,846 --> 00:41:25,156
I've got to use that

919
00:41:25,706 --> 00:41:28,086
So, instead of deleting the

920
00:41:28,086 --> 00:41:29,306
Marvel Editorial.

921
00:41:29,306 --> 00:41:30,216
I said, what can we do?

922
00:41:31,016 --> 00:41:34,216
Do we -- do you remember any

923
00:41:34,216 --> 00:41:35,906
Or could we even maybe

924
00:41:35,906 --> 00:41:37,986
to draw someone with

925
00:41:38,686 --> 00:41:41,056
And my good friend Tom

926
00:41:41,476 --> 00:41:42,766
he reminded me of Hawkeye.

927
00:41:43,316 --> 00:41:44,636
He said, oh, remember Hawkeye?

928
00:41:44,846 --> 00:41:45,496
I said, you're right.

929
00:41:45,496 --> 00:41:48,436
Back in the 80s he was on a

930
00:41:48,436 --> 00:41:52,236
by rubble and he used a sonic

931
00:41:52,276 --> 00:41:54,116
and it burst his

932
00:41:54,516 --> 00:41:57,326
And his good friend Tony

933
00:41:57,326 --> 00:41:59,126
that he is, made

934
00:41:59,506 --> 00:42:02,026
And to this day he's

935
00:41:59,506 --> 00:42:02,026
And to this day he's

936
00:42:02,026 --> 00:42:04,486
And we've done stories

937
00:42:04,486 --> 00:42:05,676
to wear his hearing aid or not.

938
00:42:05,676 --> 00:42:09,446
We've done whole issues in

939
00:42:09,446 --> 00:42:12,356
and to use him as a metaphor,

940
00:42:12,356 --> 00:42:15,756
and should be a hero, no matter

941
00:42:16,016 --> 00:42:18,796
So, I went through

942
00:42:18,796 --> 00:42:20,796
and I grabbed this

943
00:42:20,796 --> 00:42:22,116
of my favorites when

944
00:42:22,456 --> 00:42:24,496
And I sent it to Christina

945
00:42:24,686 --> 00:42:27,846
I want you to show this

946
00:42:28,156 --> 00:42:30,996
that not only do super heroes

947
00:42:30,996 --> 00:42:34,296
of the world famous

948
00:42:34,476 --> 00:42:37,456
And if Anthony wears his

949
00:42:37,526 --> 00:42:38,506
honorary Avenger.

950
00:42:39,546 --> 00:42:47,716
And I thought, [applause] -- And

951
00:42:47,716 --> 00:42:50,196
for the day, off

952
00:42:51,896 --> 00:42:58,126
The next Monday I get in my

953
00:42:58,366 --> 00:43:01,206
So, my friend Manny

954
00:42:58,366 --> 00:43:01,206
So, my friend Manny

955
00:43:01,206 --> 00:43:02,636
he knew I was sharing

956
00:43:03,146 --> 00:43:05,816
He draws this, on his

957
00:43:05,816 --> 00:43:06,896
He draws this over the weekend.

958
00:43:07,406 --> 00:43:09,506
He knew I sent the Hawkeye

959
00:43:09,936 --> 00:43:12,586
And then he invents Blue Ear

960
00:43:12,586 --> 00:43:14,856
because that's what they

961
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:17,756
And I send that to Christina.

962
00:43:18,326 --> 00:43:21,066
And we -- I said, hey

963
00:43:21,356 --> 00:43:22,806
And we said, yeah, okay, cool.

964
00:43:23,456 --> 00:43:24,876
Good deed done for the day.

965
00:43:24,916 --> 00:43:25,836
We're done right?

966
00:43:26,276 --> 00:43:29,986
No. Next day I get

967
00:43:29,986 --> 00:43:32,956
by Nelson Ribeiro,

968
00:43:33,716 --> 00:43:35,726
With his mighty hearing

969
00:43:35,726 --> 00:43:36,526
and he will go help!

970
00:43:38,196 --> 00:43:43,166
I send this to Christina and

971
00:43:43,166 --> 00:43:43,706
It's awesome!

972
00:43:47,056 --> 00:43:51,236
Three weeks later she

973
00:43:51,236 --> 00:43:55,136
Bill you don't know

974
00:43:55,416 --> 00:43:56,386
on Anthony's life.

975
00:43:57,806 --> 00:44:00,256
I've had to print out these

976
00:43:57,806 --> 00:44:00,256
I've had to print out these

977
00:44:00,676 --> 00:44:02,586
because he keeps

978
00:44:03,026 --> 00:44:04,226
and gets them all muddy.

979
00:44:04,226 --> 00:44:07,116
And now I had to put

980
00:44:07,376 --> 00:44:10,186
And he brings them to school,

981
00:44:10,186 --> 00:44:14,196
with hearing challenges, and

982
00:44:14,796 --> 00:44:20,116
and get so excited, and

983
00:44:20,946 --> 00:44:23,706
and represented, and they

984
00:44:23,706 --> 00:44:24,936
And the teacher saw --

985
00:44:25,516 --> 00:44:35,546
[ Applause ]

986
00:44:36,046 --> 00:44:38,046
The teacher saw how

987
00:44:38,886 --> 00:44:41,826
and the teachers

988
00:44:42,186 --> 00:44:46,196
where all the kids

989
00:44:46,906 --> 00:44:48,376
And as fate would have it,

990
00:44:49,226 --> 00:44:51,986
Anthony's grandfather

991
00:44:54,856 --> 00:44:55,686
Plot twist!

992
00:44:57,606 --> 00:45:00,256
So, one day the Senator is at

993
00:44:57,606 --> 00:45:00,256
So, one day the Senator is at

994
00:45:00,256 --> 00:45:02,746
and says, hey, do you

995
00:45:02,746 --> 00:45:04,496
negative political

996
00:45:04,496 --> 00:45:05,766
And he says, no, I

997
00:45:06,666 --> 00:45:09,086
These people at this company

998
00:45:09,086 --> 00:45:11,896
to draw these pieces of art

999
00:45:12,646 --> 00:45:14,606
And it was covered

1000
00:45:14,606 --> 00:45:17,766
And it started getting

1001
00:45:17,766 --> 00:45:20,076
And then I have the New York

1002
00:45:20,076 --> 00:45:21,836
to ask me about this,

1003
00:45:22,626 --> 00:45:25,176
And from that day forward

1004
00:45:25,176 --> 00:45:27,206
from families saying,

1005
00:45:27,206 --> 00:45:28,496
Can you send me the comic book?

1006
00:45:29,786 --> 00:45:33,176
And I had to keep saying,

1007
00:45:33,496 --> 00:45:34,776
There's just these

1008
00:45:34,776 --> 00:45:36,196
But I kept getting these emails.

1009
00:45:36,196 --> 00:45:37,006
Kept getting them.

1010
00:45:37,336 --> 00:45:39,986
And I bugged the hell

1011
00:45:39,986 --> 00:45:41,586
And I kept saying, we

1012
00:45:42,076 --> 00:45:42,926
We got to do a comic.

1013
00:45:42,926 --> 00:45:44,026
There's a need for this.

1014
00:45:44,026 --> 00:45:45,336
Families need this information.

1015
00:45:45,336 --> 00:45:47,386
Kids need to see

1016
00:45:48,546 --> 00:45:49,766
So, I kept bugging them.

1017
00:45:49,766 --> 00:45:50,486
I kept bugging them.

1018
00:45:50,486 --> 00:45:51,526
And at the time I was working

1019
00:45:51,526 --> 00:45:53,966
with a division called Custom

1020
00:45:53,966 --> 00:45:56,736
with clients outside of

1021
00:45:56,736 --> 00:45:59,376
or Cirque du Soleil, or

1022
00:45:59,816 --> 00:46:00,946
We would create things

1023
00:45:59,816 --> 00:46:00,946
We would create things

1024
00:46:00,996 --> 00:46:03,346
does anyone remember those

1025
00:46:03,346 --> 00:46:04,456
with our characters?

1026
00:46:04,956 --> 00:46:07,086
Yeah! That was good stuff!

1027
00:46:07,466 --> 00:46:08,576
That's the kind of

1028
00:46:08,576 --> 00:46:12,146
We would make comics

1029
00:46:12,146 --> 00:46:14,586
using our characters in an

1030
00:46:15,016 --> 00:46:16,306
to also promote another brand.

1031
00:46:16,366 --> 00:46:20,196
So, finally we partnered with

1032
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:22,526
and we made a comic book!

1033
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:25,686
But we decided, hey let's use

1034
00:46:26,096 --> 00:46:28,426
Why? We want to get

1035
00:46:29,016 --> 00:46:31,236
He's one of our most

1036
00:46:31,456 --> 00:46:33,906
But not only is he

1037
00:46:34,436 --> 00:46:35,776
We used him as a metaphor.

1038
00:46:36,666 --> 00:46:39,456
We said to the kids, hey, if

1039
00:46:39,456 --> 00:46:41,936
like Blue Ear or if you have

1040
00:46:42,686 --> 00:46:44,756
that's Saphira on the

1041
00:46:45,256 --> 00:46:47,126
because this is in the

1042
00:46:47,126 --> 00:46:48,866
we wanted to have

1043
00:46:49,606 --> 00:46:50,756
for young women to see.

1044
00:46:51,226 --> 00:46:52,766
So, we said, hey, if you

1045
00:46:52,766 --> 00:46:54,816
or cochlear implant,

1046
00:46:55,456 --> 00:46:57,926
He uses his tech to

1047
00:46:57,926 --> 00:47:00,706
You can use your tech to

1048
00:46:57,926 --> 00:47:00,706
You can use your tech to

1049
00:47:01,486 --> 00:47:04,876
And the comic came out, and the

1050
00:47:04,876 --> 00:47:07,516
from Italy and Australia

1051
00:47:07,516 --> 00:47:09,496
for copies of the comic book.

1052
00:47:10,496 --> 00:47:13,366
And that created

1053
00:47:13,366 --> 00:47:14,836
Yes, it did not stop.

1054
00:47:15,186 --> 00:47:20,556
And one day I get a call and

1055
00:47:21,676 --> 00:47:23,586
I'm like, alright.

1056
00:47:24,256 --> 00:47:29,566
So, I'm in the limo

1057
00:47:29,616 --> 00:47:32,256
Mom. Yes Billy?

1058
00:47:32,986 --> 00:47:35,786
Mom, in half hour I

1059
00:47:35,786 --> 00:47:38,096
I'm going to be on.

1060
00:47:38,096 --> 00:47:39,306
Billy, what did you do?

1061
00:47:40,646 --> 00:47:41,376
No, mom it's good!

1062
00:47:41,376 --> 00:47:41,856
It's Blue Ear.

1063
00:47:41,886 --> 00:47:42,336
It's Blue Ear.

1064
00:47:42,336 --> 00:47:43,936
He's going to be on the show.

1065
00:47:43,936 --> 00:47:45,956
And actually, Christina and

1066
00:47:45,956 --> 00:47:47,206
and we're going to meet up.

1067
00:47:48,026 --> 00:47:49,646
And they're all going

1068
00:47:49,706 --> 00:47:50,586
And then guess what.

1069
00:47:51,336 --> 00:47:52,966
Then we're going into the

1072
00:48:05,126 --> 00:48:07,076
So, there's Nelson, who

1073
00:48:07,526 --> 00:48:09,196
There's me, grinning

1074
00:48:09,406 --> 00:48:11,716
And there's Anthony,

1075
00:48:11,716 --> 00:48:13,046
in the whole Blue Ear costume,

1076
00:48:13,046 --> 00:48:16,466
because mom saw how

1077
00:48:16,466 --> 00:48:18,276
And he felt like, I'm

1078
00:48:19,076 --> 00:48:19,956
And so he dresses up like this

1079
00:48:19,956 --> 00:48:21,736
and now the town

1080
00:48:21,736 --> 00:48:23,876
And guess who was

1081
00:48:23,876 --> 00:48:28,106
of his town's Halloween parade

1082
00:48:28,686 --> 00:48:33,866
So, these Marvel characters;

1083
00:48:34,866 --> 00:48:36,086
Power and responsibility.

1084
00:48:37,146 --> 00:48:38,166
What can we learn from them?

1085
00:48:38,856 --> 00:48:41,256
We have to use our

1086
00:48:41,626 --> 00:48:44,246
Now, you may be thinking,

1087
00:48:44,246 --> 00:48:45,906
I can't leap through the sky.

1088
00:48:45,906 --> 00:48:47,916
I don't have rays

1089
00:48:47,916 --> 00:48:52,916
No, but everyone in this

1090
00:48:53,446 --> 00:48:55,536
and incredibly gifted

1091
00:48:55,886 --> 00:48:57,556
to create good things.

1092
00:48:57,916 --> 00:49:01,786
We have to use and realize

1093
00:48:57,916 --> 00:49:01,786
We have to use and realize

1094
00:49:02,156 --> 00:49:06,556
We need to use them to create

1095
00:49:06,556 --> 00:49:10,006
like Anthony, and kids around

1096
00:49:10,336 --> 00:49:14,056
We must use our creations to

1097
00:49:14,216 --> 00:49:14,936
