00:00:24,986 --> 00:00:25,546
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

00:00:29,046 --> 00:00:32,186
Good morning and welcome to

5
00:00:32,186 --> 00:00:36,096
My name is Amaury and

6
00:00:36,306 --> 00:00:38,996
to present you how we brought

7
00:00:38,996 --> 00:00:40,746
with state of the art graphics.

8
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:43,996
So we have a lot to cover today.

9
00:00:44,146 --> 00:00:47,596
So I will start with a quick

10
00:00:47,706 --> 00:00:49,616
into this new rendering

00:00:50,446 --> 00:00:53,916
Next Jean-Baptiste and

12
00:00:53,956 --> 00:00:56,826
to present a cool demo,

13
00:00:57,506 --> 00:00:59,056
and present all the new features

14
00:00:59,166 --> 00:01:00,906
such as great new

15
00:00:59,166 --> 00:01:00,906
such as great new

16
00:01:01,386 --> 00:01:07,186
And finally, Nick will join us

17
00:01:07,366 --> 00:01:08,386
So in a nutshell.

18
00:01:09,996 --> 00:01:12,576
As you know, SceneKit

19
00:01:12,576 --> 00:01:16,866
under the GameKit umbrella

20
00:01:17,586 --> 00:01:20,676
It plays nicely with

21
00:01:20,786 --> 00:01:22,536
on top of Metal [inaudible].

22
00:01:22,536 --> 00:01:26,766
And use SceneKit in any

23
00:01:26,766 --> 00:01:28,496
to disperse with the

24
00:01:29,226 --> 00:01:31,616
And when you start to think

25
00:01:31,786 --> 00:01:33,016
in a great deal of places.

26
00:01:34,236 --> 00:01:37,726
For instance, we just

27
00:01:38,316 --> 00:01:42,406
where SceneKit makes scenes

28
00:01:42,406 --> 00:01:46,746
in the first steps in

29
00:01:47,336 --> 00:01:51,986
In Xcode we use SceneKit

30
00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:53,936
and extremely useful interface

31
00:01:54,416 --> 00:01:56,896
that helps you develop

And of course SceneKit

36
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:13,546
Last, but not least, thank you.

37
00:02:14,016 --> 00:02:17,866
You guys found of so use cases

38
00:02:18,366 --> 00:02:21,216
You published thousands

39
00:02:21,246 --> 00:02:21,926
to the Store.

40
00:02:22,256 --> 00:02:22,726
So thank you.

[ Applause ]

42
00:02:29,536 --> 00:02:33,006
Now, as you know, SceneKit

43
00:02:33,006 --> 00:02:33,796
with the system.

44
00:02:34,316 --> 00:02:36,936
It works seamlessly with

45
00:02:37,316 --> 00:02:40,066
and it takes the

46
00:02:40,536 --> 00:02:42,536
where it's been available

47
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:47,296
And sense we last talked at

48
00:02:47,726 --> 00:02:48,436
on tvOS.

49
00:02:49,886 --> 00:02:53,006
All we had to do for the

50
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:56,466
to add two ports for game

51
00:02:56,466 --> 00:02:58,296
to be played on the big screen.

52
00:02:59,026 --> 00:03:02,236
So it's absolutely fantastic

53
00:02:59,026 --> 00:03:02,236
So it's absolutely fantastic

54
00:03:02,546 --> 00:03:04,656
and code can run on

55
00:03:04,656 --> 00:03:08,656
And this year we

56
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:10,926
with SceneKit coming to watchOS.

58
00:03:13,376 --> 00:03:14,406
Thank you.

[ Applause ]

60
00:03:17,646 --> 00:03:22,816
So SceneKit on watchOS is a

61
00:03:22,816 --> 00:03:25,136
to think about new

62
00:03:25,136 --> 00:03:27,736
to present content

63
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:31,086
Now, as you might imagine,

64
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:33,036
about the [inaudible]

65
00:03:33,286 --> 00:03:35,946
And we won't have time

66
00:03:35,946 --> 00:03:38,776
But we have a [inaudible]

67
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:42,426
for Apple Watch," on Friday,

68
00:03:42,426 --> 00:03:45,766
about what's available, how to

69
00:03:45,766 --> 00:03:46,826
and other technologies.

70
00:03:47,336 --> 00:03:50,776
And if you are new to SceneKit

71
00:03:50,776 --> 00:03:54,446
you can always go online to

72
00:03:54,856 --> 00:03:56,456
where we explained basic,

73
00:03:56,586 --> 00:03:59,076
but also really advanced,

74
00:04:00,656 --> 00:04:04,596
Okay. So now let's dive into

75
00:04:05,726 --> 00:04:08,356
Well, this year SceneKit puts

76
00:04:08,356 --> 00:04:10,576
in the hands of everyone.

77
00:04:11,686 --> 00:04:13,716
It means that developers,

78
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:18,185
get to have stunning graphics

79
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:23,316
It's the biggest leap forward in

80
00:04:23,446 --> 00:04:24,966
since its introduction.

81
00:04:25,586 --> 00:04:28,096
We rely on the latest

82
00:04:28,466 --> 00:04:32,136
and leverage modern technologies

83
00:04:32,446 --> 00:04:33,546
and physically based shading.

84
00:04:34,066 --> 00:04:38,096
Now, physically based

85
00:04:38,096 --> 00:04:38,916
[inaudible] requirements.

86
00:04:39,156 --> 00:04:41,706
So we start with

87
00:04:43,146 --> 00:04:46,976
So what you see here is a smooth

88
00:04:46,976 --> 00:04:50,296
to one and, as you can see,

89
00:04:51,136 --> 00:04:54,166
That is until you comprise

90
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:56,746
in an eight disk optic

91
00:04:57,536 --> 00:05:00,106
And, as you can see,

92
00:04:57,536 --> 00:05:00,106
And, as you can see,

93
00:05:00,196 --> 00:05:04,246
And that's new because our eye

94
00:05:04,356 --> 00:05:05,256
in the dark effluence.

95
00:05:06,526 --> 00:05:10,836
Now by applying gamma encoding

96
00:05:10,906 --> 00:05:12,386
to these darker turns.

97
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:15,956
So, for instance,

98
00:05:16,296 --> 00:05:18,096
which shows the difference

99
00:05:18,096 --> 00:05:20,746
between storing pixel

100
00:05:21,296 --> 00:05:22,396
or using gamma encoding.

101
00:05:22,956 --> 00:05:28,646
Now the thing is that when

102
00:05:28,646 --> 00:05:29,806
lighting information

103
00:05:29,806 --> 00:05:32,926
and equations are

104
00:05:34,056 --> 00:05:37,926
So in a non-linear pipeline

105
00:05:37,986 --> 00:05:38,826
that [inaudible] that is rich

106
00:05:38,826 --> 00:05:40,726
with gamma encoded

107
00:05:41,366 --> 00:05:44,026
and then it's processed

108
00:05:44,026 --> 00:05:46,666
and the resulting

109
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:48,006
to a texture or framebuffer.

110
00:05:48,876 --> 00:05:51,016
And, as you might imagine,

111
00:05:52,076 --> 00:05:55,866
For the final image to be

112
00:05:55,866 --> 00:05:58,096
to happen in enough space.

113
00:05:59,496 --> 00:06:02,436
So, as an illustration,

114
00:05:59,496 --> 00:06:02,436
So, as an illustration,

115
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:05,706
with lighting occurring

116
00:06:06,536 --> 00:06:09,806
And here is the same scene

117
00:06:11,066 --> 00:06:13,756
And if you compare them, you

118
00:06:13,966 --> 00:06:19,096
and edges appear harsher

119
00:06:19,096 --> 00:06:21,116
Now linear rendering

120
00:06:21,116 --> 00:06:25,116
for physically based rendering

121
00:06:25,116 --> 00:06:26,276
of the SceneKit lighting model

122
00:06:26,646 --> 00:06:28,476
because it just makes

123
00:06:30,516 --> 00:06:33,596
Now, as you know, color is a

124
00:06:33,596 --> 00:06:39,466
at WWDC so in addition to

125
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:42,756
management automatically.

126
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:45,806
So what does that mean?

127
00:06:46,566 --> 00:06:49,006
It means that the color

128
00:06:49,006 --> 00:06:50,616
to a texture will

129
00:06:51,766 --> 00:06:54,956
Any operation that happens

130
00:06:55,016 --> 00:06:57,986
from disk to the moment

131
00:06:57,986 --> 00:06:59,546
so that it can be

132
00:07:00,046 --> 00:07:02,606
we will respect the

133
00:07:03,856 --> 00:07:08,876
So a SceneKit-based application

134
00:07:08,876 --> 00:07:10,876
of the color accuracy

135
00:07:11,706 --> 00:07:15,046
of a professional

136
00:07:15,046 --> 00:07:19,416
Now, as you know, [inaudible]

137
00:07:19,556 --> 00:07:21,386
to be stored as colors.

138
00:07:21,766 --> 00:07:22,776
And SceneKit knows that

139
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:24,976
and so it won't color

140
00:07:24,976 --> 00:07:28,556
Now to help you with that

141
00:07:28,556 --> 00:07:32,986
in Xcode 8 asset catalogs

142
00:07:34,456 --> 00:07:39,586
In a texture set one can specify

143
00:07:39,586 --> 00:07:44,226
data or raw data and then Xcode

144
00:07:44,226 --> 00:07:48,356
images to CPU and GPU

145
00:07:48,866 --> 00:07:51,786
But to learn more about

146
00:07:51,786 --> 00:07:53,986
after lunch, "Working

147
00:07:54,326 --> 00:07:58,906
where the Metal team gets

148
00:07:59,036 --> 00:08:01,336
Now, in addition to textures,

149
00:07:59,036 --> 00:08:01,336
Now, in addition to textures,

150
00:08:01,786 --> 00:08:04,226
color management also

151
00:08:05,306 --> 00:08:08,106
So color components are no

152
00:08:08,976 --> 00:08:11,056
And so if you are creating

153
00:08:11,316 --> 00:08:14,416
it's now really important that

154
00:08:15,586 --> 00:08:18,676
So here is an illustration

155
00:08:19,016 --> 00:08:21,556
one Display P3 and

156
00:08:21,976 --> 00:08:24,256
that were created using

157
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:28,616
When working with color

158
00:08:28,616 --> 00:08:29,916
to the color space

159
00:08:30,446 --> 00:08:33,775
Above the menu we let you choose

160
00:08:34,275 --> 00:08:36,296
including device

161
00:08:36,436 --> 00:08:37,525
such as [inaudible]

162
00:08:37,736 --> 00:08:42,296
And there's also a handy

163
00:08:42,366 --> 00:08:44,236
as [inaudible] rather

164
00:08:44,236 --> 00:08:48,496
so that they can be

165
00:08:48,496 --> 00:08:50,996
And speaking of which,

166
00:08:51,636 --> 00:08:53,856
shader modifiers are a

167
00:08:54,026 --> 00:08:57,006
that will allow you to

168
00:08:58,016 --> 00:09:01,706
Now, as I said, this year

169
00:08:58,016 --> 00:09:01,706
Now, as I said, this year

170
00:09:02,216 --> 00:09:04,916
So you must be sure

171
00:09:05,376 --> 00:09:09,126
to the linear extended sRGB

172
00:09:09,126 --> 00:09:11,096
components are used

173
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:18,716
Now a few notes about

174
00:09:18,896 --> 00:09:22,276
Linear rendering and color

175
00:09:22,276 --> 00:09:25,506
enabled whenever you link your

176
00:09:26,326 --> 00:09:28,856
There's no performance

177
00:09:29,056 --> 00:09:31,666
but they will dramatically

178
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:32,116
of [inaudible] scenes.

179
00:09:32,936 --> 00:09:35,496
So, for instance,

180
00:09:35,886 --> 00:09:37,696
which did not use

181
00:09:38,596 --> 00:09:42,526
And here's what happens

182
00:09:42,716 --> 00:09:45,326
Now, of course, textures,

183
00:09:45,446 --> 00:09:47,136
and shadow modifiers

184
00:09:47,556 --> 00:09:48,816
with linear rendering in mind.

185
00:09:49,596 --> 00:09:52,786
But if you want to deploy your

186
00:09:52,786 --> 00:09:55,696
of the system, or want to

187
00:09:55,696 --> 00:09:57,276
in color management

188
00:09:57,796 --> 00:09:58,906
we have found a way to do that.

189
00:09:59,436 --> 00:10:03,686
You can [inaudible]

190
00:09:59,436 --> 00:10:03,686
You can [inaudible]

191
00:10:03,806 --> 00:10:05,846
in your apps Info.plist file.

192
00:10:06,376 --> 00:10:10,176
And then there is

193
00:10:10,616 --> 00:10:13,786
So, as you know, with

194
00:10:13,786 --> 00:10:17,586
such as extended sRGB

195
00:10:17,586 --> 00:10:19,286
and they are really important

196
00:10:19,466 --> 00:10:20,976
when working for

197
00:10:22,486 --> 00:10:24,746
The new iPad Pro and iMac

198
00:10:24,826 --> 00:10:27,376
with Retina Display

199
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:29,216
that SceneKit can

200
00:10:30,066 --> 00:10:32,756
All you have to do is to

201
00:10:33,156 --> 00:10:35,716
so textures or colors,

202
00:10:35,986 --> 00:10:40,376
and SceneKit will enter

203
00:10:42,036 --> 00:10:43,326
Now wide gamut textures

204
00:10:43,326 --> 00:10:47,236
and framebuffer will require

205
00:10:47,236 --> 00:10:49,806
and that will lead to an

206
00:10:50,056 --> 00:10:52,286
So may you experience

207
00:10:52,386 --> 00:11:01,376
we offer a way to upload again

208
00:10:52,386 --> 00:11:01,376
we offer a way to upload again

209
00:11:01,516 --> 00:11:04,466
Now let me mention the color

210
00:11:05,176 --> 00:11:06,606
that we built in collaboration

211
00:11:06,606 --> 00:11:08,416
with the Cocoa and

212
00:11:09,286 --> 00:11:12,256
It's a synching-based

213
00:11:12,396 --> 00:11:14,846
to see the out of

214
00:11:15,806 --> 00:11:17,026
and it's also really useful

215
00:11:17,026 --> 00:11:20,236
because on the wide gamut

216
00:11:20,236 --> 00:11:21,956
to see what this display brings

217
00:11:22,036 --> 00:11:24,726
because you can simulate

218
00:11:25,296 --> 00:11:29,686
So to learn now about working

219
00:11:29,686 --> 00:11:34,626
to convert color components

220
00:11:35,176 --> 00:11:36,856
again we have a great

221
00:11:37,386 --> 00:11:41,756
And so that works for accurate

222
00:11:42,396 --> 00:11:44,046
of physically based rendering.

223
00:11:45,626 --> 00:11:50,276
Now what is physically

224
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:54,176
Well, [inaudible] scenes

225
00:11:54,176 --> 00:11:59,316
And that is definitely true.

226
00:11:59,316 --> 00:12:02,306
But shading is what

227
00:11:59,316 --> 00:12:02,306
But shading is what

228
00:12:03,256 --> 00:12:05,436
So all you see here

229
00:12:05,436 --> 00:12:06,796
to be a soup of polygons.

230
00:12:07,776 --> 00:12:10,706
And shading is a process

231
00:12:10,706 --> 00:12:12,216
for each detail on the screen.

232
00:12:12,516 --> 00:12:16,516
So all the highlights,

233
00:12:17,026 --> 00:12:18,076
it comes from shading.

234
00:12:19,776 --> 00:12:22,826
Shading is that magical

235
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:24,426
that can bring a scene to life.

236
00:12:25,426 --> 00:12:26,756
Now how does it work?

237
00:12:27,506 --> 00:12:30,306
Well, first there is light

238
00:12:31,056 --> 00:12:35,546
And when light hits an object it

239
00:12:35,626 --> 00:12:38,896
to properties of the surface

240
00:12:38,896 --> 00:12:41,906
to find your eye or a

241
00:12:42,456 --> 00:12:46,786
Now this interaction between

242
00:12:46,786 --> 00:12:47,776
that is really complex.

243
00:12:48,436 --> 00:12:50,896
And over the years many

244
00:12:50,896 --> 00:12:54,356
developed to try to

245
00:12:54,556 --> 00:12:58,596
Physically based rendering is an

246
00:12:58,806 --> 00:13:01,886
that relies on such mathematical

247
00:12:58,806 --> 00:13:01,886
that relies on such mathematical

248
00:13:01,886 --> 00:13:04,496
into account the physical

249
00:13:05,446 --> 00:13:09,066
But, as you know, SceneKit is

250
00:13:09,186 --> 00:13:12,076
to allow anyone to benefit

251
00:13:12,536 --> 00:13:15,596
So we will expose a

252
00:13:15,956 --> 00:13:17,956
so that you can use

253
00:13:18,096 --> 00:13:19,346
that artists love.

254
00:13:20,256 --> 00:13:23,096
So at the end of this session

255
00:13:23,096 --> 00:13:25,326
from this rendering,

256
00:13:25,326 --> 00:13:27,336
to a physically based one.

257
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:32,596
Okay. So in SceneKit we

258
00:13:32,596 --> 00:13:34,086
rendering from two angles.

259
00:13:34,606 --> 00:13:37,346
First, physically based

260
00:13:37,656 --> 00:13:38,596
physically based lights.

261
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:45,286
So first, physically

262
00:13:46,936 --> 00:13:49,866
Here is a description of

263
00:13:50,236 --> 00:13:53,166
with normally indicating its

264
00:13:54,396 --> 00:13:57,306
And when light hits that point,

265
00:13:58,186 --> 00:14:00,706
diffuse reflection and

266
00:13:58,186 --> 00:14:00,706
diffuse reflection and

267
00:14:01,346 --> 00:14:04,206
Now diffuse reflection

268
00:14:04,566 --> 00:14:08,036
that goes underneath the surface

269
00:14:08,036 --> 00:14:10,616
and in so many directions

270
00:14:12,076 --> 00:14:15,086
The color of the diffuse

271
00:14:15,676 --> 00:14:16,916
or the base color of the object.

272
00:14:17,536 --> 00:14:20,456
So when designing the interface

273
00:14:20,456 --> 00:14:24,586
in SceneKit we will want

274
00:14:24,766 --> 00:14:28,926
Now specular reflection

275
00:14:29,056 --> 00:14:31,286
Specular reflection

276
00:14:31,346 --> 00:14:33,566
that bounces off the

277
00:14:33,566 --> 00:14:35,386
of the color of the

278
00:14:35,946 --> 00:14:37,966
So here is what we

279
00:14:38,386 --> 00:14:41,956
It's a collection of six spaces

280
00:14:41,956 --> 00:14:44,336
around the location in 3D space.

281
00:14:45,606 --> 00:14:48,116
And when we place a

282
00:14:48,116 --> 00:14:51,336
in such an environment we will

283
00:14:51,336 --> 00:14:56,456
Now let's take a more realistic

284
00:14:57,356 --> 00:14:59,136
As you can see, it's

285
00:14:59,136 --> 00:15:03,946
At the center is the reflection

286
00:14:59,136 --> 00:15:03,946
At the center is the reflection

287
00:15:04,066 --> 00:15:05,636
to the edge it gets brighter.

288
00:15:06,496 --> 00:15:09,676
And actually for raising

289
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:14,446
Now not all materials have

290
00:15:14,906 --> 00:15:17,336
What you see on the

291
00:15:17,386 --> 00:15:21,176
which represents the

292
00:15:21,266 --> 00:15:23,716
of the incident angle

293
00:15:24,376 --> 00:15:27,796
And you will see that these

294
00:15:27,796 --> 00:15:29,676
constant from zero to 45 degrees

295
00:15:30,036 --> 00:15:31,716
and actually we can

296
00:15:32,116 --> 00:15:33,296
to reconstruct the whole curve.

297
00:15:33,296 --> 00:15:36,806
Now gold is an interesting

298
00:15:37,276 --> 00:15:40,676
because it has different

299
00:15:40,676 --> 00:15:42,246
green, and blue components.

300
00:15:43,586 --> 00:15:47,906
The one last thing to note here

301
00:15:47,906 --> 00:15:52,756
and gold, have high reflectivity

302
00:15:53,036 --> 00:15:56,346
or dielectrics have low

303
00:15:56,646 --> 00:15:58,756
And this difference

304
00:15:58,756 --> 00:16:01,116
in reflectivity is

305
00:15:58,756 --> 00:16:01,116
in reflectivity is

306
00:16:01,116 --> 00:16:02,326
for the final look

307
00:16:02,766 --> 00:16:05,636
So in SceneKit we want

308
00:16:06,486 --> 00:16:10,566
which will indicate which

309
00:16:10,566 --> 00:16:12,286
and which part is not.

310
00:16:13,616 --> 00:16:15,436
So in addition to reflectivity

311
00:16:15,486 --> 00:16:17,536
to different type

312
00:16:18,026 --> 00:16:21,046
also note that metals will

313
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:24,256
surface where dielectric

314
00:16:24,636 --> 00:16:26,766
So the visual effect of this is

315
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:31,146
that metals have a wide

316
00:16:31,346 --> 00:16:35,746
and no diffuse reflection and

317
00:16:35,746 --> 00:16:39,556
of diffusion and specular

318
00:16:39,606 --> 00:16:40,916
only at raising angles.

319
00:16:42,306 --> 00:16:47,426
So in SceneKit we will reuse

320
00:16:47,866 --> 00:16:50,866
to store the reflectivity

321
00:16:50,866 --> 00:16:53,436
and the albedo of dielectrics.

322
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:57,126
And for the reflectivity values

323
00:16:57,126 --> 00:17:01,046
of dieletrics we just use

324
00:16:57,126 --> 00:17:01,046
of dieletrics we just use

325
00:17:03,096 --> 00:17:06,906
So we just reuse the

326
00:17:07,156 --> 00:17:10,476
that we brought from

327
00:17:10,656 --> 00:17:13,236
Now one last aspect

328
00:17:13,236 --> 00:17:15,476
about is the surface roughness.

329
00:17:16,856 --> 00:17:19,925
So, as you know, no

330
00:17:20,415 --> 00:17:23,576
As a microscopic level

331
00:17:24,056 --> 00:17:26,715
and cracks that will affect

332
00:17:27,996 --> 00:17:30,076
So the rougher the

333
00:17:30,996 --> 00:17:34,746
the blurrier the reflection

334
00:17:34,746 --> 00:17:36,346
of light are no longer aligned.

335
00:17:37,296 --> 00:17:40,526
So again in SceneKit we would

336
00:17:40,966 --> 00:17:45,216
which will indicate which

337
00:17:45,256 --> 00:17:46,456
and which part is smooth.

338
00:17:46,926 --> 00:17:48,676
And this one is a

339
00:17:51,286 --> 00:17:56,916
So we just saw how we can divide

340
00:17:57,496 --> 00:18:00,656
and each of them has a

341
00:17:57,496 --> 00:18:00,656
and each of them has a

342
00:18:00,826 --> 00:18:02,096
from [inaudible]

343
00:18:02,096 --> 00:18:05,436
Now creating a physically

344
00:18:05,476 --> 00:18:08,266
in SceneKit is straightforward.

345
00:18:08,736 --> 00:18:12,456
You first create a material,

346
00:18:12,456 --> 00:18:14,456
to the new physically

347
00:18:14,936 --> 00:18:16,526
and finally you provide

348
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:19,406
So let's take an example.

349
00:18:19,856 --> 00:18:23,046
We start with a mine cart

350
00:18:23,986 --> 00:18:25,376
We will then add

351
00:18:25,786 --> 00:18:27,906
So, for instance,

352
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:31,856
Coal is rough so there

353
00:18:32,796 --> 00:18:35,786
And finally we will

354
00:18:36,256 --> 00:18:39,196
So, for instance, take a

355
00:18:39,726 --> 00:18:42,856
Let's take another example.

356
00:18:43,086 --> 00:18:44,236
We have a fire truck.

357
00:18:45,326 --> 00:18:46,696
Again, we start with

358
00:18:46,696 --> 00:18:49,516
Now we will add a metalness map.

359
00:18:50,076 --> 00:18:53,136
And finally a roughness map.

360
00:18:53,346 --> 00:18:58,956
So for instance,

361
00:18:59,126 --> 00:19:02,116
Now one thing I would

362
00:18:59,126 --> 00:19:02,116
Now one thing I would

363
00:19:02,806 --> 00:19:05,816
For the metalness, roughness,

364
00:19:06,266 --> 00:19:08,136
please use grayscale images.

365
00:19:08,646 --> 00:19:11,056
Having different channels

366
00:19:11,056 --> 00:19:13,466
and blue would just

367
00:19:13,826 --> 00:19:15,636
And even more if you

368
00:19:16,976 --> 00:19:19,456
Now, furthermore, if you

369
00:19:19,456 --> 00:19:22,146
over the whole surface, you

370
00:19:22,746 --> 00:19:26,116
or even better, for these

371
00:19:26,386 --> 00:19:26,756
[inaudible] numbers.

372
00:19:28,896 --> 00:19:31,956
So we just saw how we can

373
00:19:31,956 --> 00:19:35,476
and high-level API to create

374
00:19:36,116 --> 00:19:37,176
Here is the same object

375
00:19:37,906 --> 00:19:40,576
and on one axis we changed

376
00:19:41,006 --> 00:19:44,236
and on the other axis we

377
00:19:46,296 --> 00:19:49,406
Now remember how we said that

378
00:19:49,456 --> 00:19:50,036
based rendering.

379
00:19:51,146 --> 00:19:54,016
Let's now have a look at

380
00:19:54,956 --> 00:19:57,816
Well, in SceneKit lights can

381
00:19:58,256 --> 00:20:02,296
I will start with image

382
00:19:58,256 --> 00:20:02,296
I will start with image

383
00:20:02,996 --> 00:20:05,546
then cover light probes,

384
00:20:06,766 --> 00:20:08,586
So image based lighting.

385
00:20:09,126 --> 00:20:14,586
As I said, you can use a cube

386
00:20:14,776 --> 00:20:17,136
around a location in 3D space.

387
00:20:18,536 --> 00:20:19,866
So when shading a point

388
00:20:19,866 --> 00:20:22,436
on the surface we can

389
00:20:22,436 --> 00:20:24,736
above the end point

390
00:20:25,196 --> 00:20:27,846
and the right lighting

391
00:20:27,966 --> 00:20:29,866
that is [inaudible]

392
00:20:30,496 --> 00:20:32,826
So for instance,

393
00:20:33,176 --> 00:20:36,016
which is lit only using

394
00:20:36,316 --> 00:20:37,756
There is no light in that scene.

395
00:20:38,276 --> 00:20:39,476
And you can see how changing

396
00:20:39,476 --> 00:20:44,236
to cube map dramatically

397
00:20:44,396 --> 00:20:47,006
Using image based

398
00:20:47,006 --> 00:20:49,166
in your scene will

399
00:20:49,326 --> 00:20:50,696
and will work nicely together.

400
00:20:51,316 --> 00:20:53,606
By using image based lighting

401
00:20:53,726 --> 00:20:55,316
in SceneKit is really

402
00:20:55,986 --> 00:20:59,216
We added a lighting environment

403
00:20:59,936 --> 00:21:02,336
And you can simply set a

404
00:20:59,936 --> 00:21:02,336
And you can simply set a

405
00:21:03,226 --> 00:21:05,426
And what's great is

406
00:21:05,426 --> 00:21:06,536
with the background property.

407
00:21:07,786 --> 00:21:13,106
So for instance, if you take an

408
00:21:13,186 --> 00:21:15,706
to the background and

409
00:21:15,706 --> 00:21:19,346
you will be able to display

410
00:21:21,096 --> 00:21:25,416
Now cube map, it can show

411
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:26,316
and the aesthetic.

412
00:21:27,556 --> 00:21:30,316
So when shading a point on

413
00:21:30,686 --> 00:21:34,946
that this environment is not

414
00:21:35,236 --> 00:21:37,166
or there's another

415
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:40,016
And that can be taken

416
00:21:40,056 --> 00:21:41,136
with image based lighting.

417
00:21:41,326 --> 00:21:45,456
So it does not work very

418
00:21:45,546 --> 00:21:51,536
Luckily we have a solution

419
00:21:51,536 --> 00:21:55,276
Light probes are local lights

420
00:21:55,466 --> 00:21:59,756
and they capture the local

421
00:22:00,236 --> 00:22:01,706
So when shading a point

422
00:22:01,706 --> 00:22:06,126
on a surface we can find the

423
00:22:06,126 --> 00:22:08,996
and interpolate lighting

424
00:22:08,996 --> 00:22:13,556
So as I said, light probes,

425
00:22:13,656 --> 00:22:15,536
and so they can account

426
00:22:16,446 --> 00:22:18,556
And they are implemented

427
00:22:18,556 --> 00:22:20,546
that they are really

428
00:22:21,346 --> 00:22:24,046
You can have dozens of

429
00:22:24,396 --> 00:22:25,826
And we actually recommend that.

430
00:22:26,686 --> 00:22:28,216
Because the more

431
00:22:29,276 --> 00:22:30,476
the finer the [inaudible]

432
00:22:30,626 --> 00:22:33,286
and the better local lighting

433
00:22:34,456 --> 00:22:36,486
So creating a light

434
00:22:37,156 --> 00:22:39,106
You create the light and

435
00:22:40,126 --> 00:22:41,956
That can be done

436
00:22:42,456 --> 00:22:44,856
or within the Xcode

437
00:22:46,306 --> 00:22:48,056
Now just like cube maps,

438
00:22:48,436 --> 00:22:51,506
light probes capture

439
00:22:52,016 --> 00:22:53,926
And this information

440
00:22:54,296 --> 00:22:59,506
into the probe easily using the

441
00:23:00,536 --> 00:23:02,866
So we just saw how using IBL

442
00:23:02,866 --> 00:23:09,266
or light probes you can have

443
00:23:09,876 --> 00:23:13,006
But of course if you want direct

444
00:23:13,036 --> 00:23:14,606
to all the other kind of lights.

445
00:23:15,746 --> 00:23:20,016
So omnidirectional, directional,

446
00:23:20,016 --> 00:23:21,316
with physically based rendering.

447
00:23:21,746 --> 00:23:23,836
And actually we have [inaudible]

448
00:23:24,406 --> 00:23:26,516
so that you can be

449
00:23:27,836 --> 00:23:30,856
For instance, we added

450
00:23:31,886 --> 00:23:35,796
A light's intensity is expressed

451
00:23:35,796 --> 00:23:38,146
of watt 1000 which

452
00:23:38,146 --> 00:23:39,566
of magnitude of a light bulb.

453
00:23:40,646 --> 00:23:44,746
We also added a light's

454
00:23:44,746 --> 00:23:47,346
in Kelvin and from which

455
00:23:48,796 --> 00:23:51,736
And one great new feature,

456
00:23:51,736 --> 00:23:52,996
of lights, IES lights.

457
00:23:54,396 --> 00:23:56,786
So IES lights, or

458
00:23:57,046 --> 00:23:59,316
can account for any

459
00:24:00,136 --> 00:24:01,876
So while the spot light

460
00:24:01,996 --> 00:24:06,356
or omnidirectional light has a

461
00:24:07,216 --> 00:24:10,406
curve, IES lights can better

462
00:24:10,406 --> 00:24:11,706
of a theater world light.

463
00:24:12,746 --> 00:24:15,106
And, for instance, it can

464
00:24:15,316 --> 00:24:16,866
It can account for shadows.

465
00:24:17,406 --> 00:24:19,736
For example, due to

466
00:24:20,556 --> 00:24:24,506
Now creating photometric lights

467
00:24:24,876 --> 00:24:25,876
Again, you create the light.

468
00:24:26,406 --> 00:24:27,576
Then you change its type.

469
00:24:28,406 --> 00:24:32,596
And finally you provide the

470
00:24:32,626 --> 00:24:34,886
which can, for instance,

471
00:24:34,886 --> 00:24:36,616
from the website

472
00:24:37,206 --> 00:24:43,116
So as a quick recap, we

473
00:24:43,116 --> 00:24:45,756
to create a physically

474
00:24:46,106 --> 00:24:49,496
and all these properties derive

475
00:24:49,496 --> 00:24:52,096
on the surface so they are

476
00:24:52,536 --> 00:24:54,816
and how we can work with

477
00:24:54,876 --> 00:24:56,106
of physically based material.

478
00:24:56,886 --> 00:25:00,406
So with that please

479
00:24:56,886 --> 00:25:00,406
So with that please

480
00:25:00,406 --> 00:25:01,976
and Sebastien for great demos.

[ Applause ]

482
00:25:04,216 --> 00:25:07,536
&gt;&gt; So thank you, Amaury,

483
00:25:08,036 --> 00:25:10,826
of the new rendering

484
00:25:12,156 --> 00:25:16,246
So let's see them in

485
00:25:16,246 --> 00:25:20,376
So, as you will see,

486
00:25:20,416 --> 00:25:21,206
that has been presented

487
00:25:21,206 --> 00:25:25,396
by Amaury is actually

488
00:25:25,396 --> 00:25:25,706
in the [inaudible].

489
00:25:25,806 --> 00:25:31,716
You will be able

490
00:25:31,896 --> 00:25:33,336
and see the result in real time.

491
00:25:34,066 --> 00:25:37,266
So I have a very simple

492
00:25:38,006 --> 00:25:40,916
with just one light

493
00:25:41,686 --> 00:25:47,336
I go to the Materials inspector.

494
00:25:47,336 --> 00:25:50,076
As you can see we have just

495
00:25:50,776 --> 00:25:52,826
One for the body and one for

496
00:25:52,956 --> 00:25:55,486
So I'm going to select

497
00:25:56,686 --> 00:25:59,896
We are continue using the Blinn

498
00:25:59,896 --> 00:26:01,396
to the physically

499
00:25:59,896 --> 00:26:01,396
to the physically

500
00:26:01,986 --> 00:26:05,966
Now I've set the two

501
00:26:07,256 --> 00:26:09,226
And, as you can see,

502
00:26:09,226 --> 00:26:13,126
because we don't see the

503
00:26:13,526 --> 00:26:18,566
So we can go to the Scene

504
00:26:18,566 --> 00:26:20,406
to set the lighting

505
00:26:20,976 --> 00:26:29,466
So for that I will use the cube

506
00:26:29,466 --> 00:26:39,076
of a parking as the

507
00:26:41,516 --> 00:26:45,156
So. Shortly I'm focusing on

508
00:26:45,286 --> 00:26:47,236
of the physically

509
00:26:48,056 --> 00:26:50,206
So let's now move to

510
00:26:51,456 --> 00:26:57,926
The roughness is indicate

511
00:26:58,086 --> 00:27:03,506
So you will see that the

512
00:26:58,086 --> 00:27:03,506
So you will see that the

513
00:27:03,666 --> 00:27:06,846
the blurrier the

514
00:27:06,936 --> 00:27:10,396
So if I move the value of

515
00:27:10,396 --> 00:27:14,696
I have a blurry reflection.

516
00:27:14,696 --> 00:27:17,406
And then almost no reflection

517
00:27:20,216 --> 00:27:24,516
So if I move back to zero, I

518
00:27:25,106 --> 00:27:30,226
as you can see, everything is,

519
00:27:30,226 --> 00:27:36,726
the whole environment is

520
00:27:36,726 --> 00:27:39,926
So now I'm using just

521
00:27:39,926 --> 00:27:41,776
for the roughness.

522
00:27:41,776 --> 00:27:45,666
And I would like to be able

523
00:27:45,666 --> 00:27:46,706
for each part of the object.

524
00:27:46,746 --> 00:27:48,596
For that I just have

525
00:27:49,196 --> 00:27:51,116
So let's use a roughness

526
00:27:59,596 --> 00:28:01,486
And a roughness map

527
00:27:59,596 --> 00:28:01,486
And a roughness map

528
00:28:02,506 --> 00:28:05,186
So we have the same kind of

529
00:28:05,326 --> 00:28:07,256
So we want to be able

530
00:28:07,256 --> 00:28:08,466
of the object is

531
00:28:08,976 --> 00:28:10,866
So for that we [inaudible].

532
00:28:11,296 --> 00:28:15,706
So let's set the metalness

533
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:18,486
A different map.

534
00:28:24,416 --> 00:28:26,656
So, as you can see,

535
00:28:26,806 --> 00:28:32,206
of the object is nonmetallic

536
00:28:32,376 --> 00:28:33,846
is completely metallic.

537
00:28:38,336 --> 00:28:39,976
The final touch is

538
00:28:49,026 --> 00:28:49,976
And we will be done.

539
00:28:55,116 --> 00:28:55,866
So that's it.

540
00:28:56,026 --> 00:28:58,726
So we have a full [inaudible]

541
00:28:59,206 --> 00:29:02,116
I can now switch

542
00:28:59,206 --> 00:29:02,116
I can now switch

543
00:29:02,116 --> 00:29:03,566
and change the cube map.

544
00:29:04,196 --> 00:29:05,146
For example, this cube map

545
00:29:05,206 --> 00:29:08,756
of the lighting environment

546
00:29:09,246 --> 00:29:10,796
I can set it in the background.

547
00:29:13,316 --> 00:29:14,056
So that's it.

548
00:29:15,226 --> 00:29:18,636
So, as you've seen,

549
00:29:19,136 --> 00:29:22,956
to use the new SceneKit

550
00:29:23,416 --> 00:29:25,556
And, you know, now to

551
00:29:25,646 --> 00:29:29,066
of rendering in action we've

552
00:29:29,066 --> 00:29:34,236

00:29:40,726 --> 00:29:43,226
So I'm delighted to present

558
00:29:43,346 --> 00:29:43,946
for this year.

559
00:29:44,446 --> 00:29:45,996
Bub. Bub is a badger.

560
00:29:46,086 --> 00:29:47,486
He rides in the mining cart.

561
00:29:47,926 --> 00:29:52,296
And he tries to catch gems

562
00:29:54,396 --> 00:29:55,636

00:30:28,466 --> 00:30:32,226
We placed light probes

572
00:30:32,226 --> 00:30:34,906
into account the

573
00:30:34,906 --> 00:30:38,836
And pay attention to the

574
00:30:38,876 --> 00:30:42,686
in the caves or in the tunnels.

575
00:30:42,686 --> 00:30:48,956
We have also added new

576
00:30:49,266 --> 00:30:52,846
which you can see when Bub

577
00:30:53,526 --> 00:30:55,416
like this.

578
00:30:55,626 --> 00:30:59,876
We have a new HGI camera

579
00:30:59,876 --> 00:31:02,886
and when there is a bright light

580
00:30:59,876 --> 00:31:02,886
and when there is a bright light

581
00:31:04,006 --> 00:31:08,116
We also use IDL's for

00:31:09,486 --> 00:31:12,806
Again some new, some,

583
00:31:14,276 --> 00:31:19,086
You can also see bloom when

584
00:31:20,506 --> 00:31:23,946
And all the materials, as

585
00:31:24,376 --> 00:31:26,356
so we have free reflections

Once again, you will

588
00:31:32,936 --> 00:31:35,836
It's tone mapping

I will tell you a bit

593

to tell you this year is that as

You can download the code on

599
00:32:03,106 --> 00:32:05,516
from the developer

600
00:32:05,516 --> 00:32:09,286
inspect the scene code,

601
00:32:09,436 --> 00:32:12,036
And it's 700 lines

602
00:32:12,196 --> 00:32:13,816
We think it's pretty

603
00:32:13,816 --> 00:32:17,156
and we hope you really like

604
00:32:17,156 --> 00:32:18,576
of things from the demo.

605
00:32:19,956 --> 00:32:23,286
So this year we had to

606
00:32:23,286 --> 00:32:25,886
we discussed it with

607
00:32:26,016 --> 00:32:30,696
And we produced some

608
00:32:30,696 --> 00:32:32,666
into account the

609
00:32:33,366 --> 00:32:35,616
And once we agreed

610
00:32:35,786 --> 00:32:39,876
and the workflow the artists

611
00:32:40,356 --> 00:32:44,966
And as it's an interactive

612
00:32:44,966 --> 00:32:47,866
to be able to ingest the

613
00:32:48,156 --> 00:32:49,736
and to start programming

614
00:32:49,846 --> 00:32:52,956
without waiting for

615
00:32:54,126 --> 00:32:56,096
So we have a custom

616
00:32:56,096 --> 00:32:58,436
that uses the full

617
00:32:58,686 --> 00:33:00,736
in a common line application.

618
00:32:58,686 --> 00:33:00,736

to meters and they also place

621
00:33:09,226 --> 00:33:11,796
in the scene because there

622
00:33:11,886 --> 00:33:14,766
and we don't want, we

623
00:33:14,766 --> 00:33:16,546
in by hand each time

624
00:33:17,076 --> 00:33:21,796
We have used image

625
00:33:22,196 --> 00:33:25,126
So we have a cube map

626
00:33:25,366 --> 00:33:27,496
another cube map for the

627
00:33:27,866 --> 00:33:29,996
We used the lighting environment

628
00:33:30,446 --> 00:33:32,716
And it's, as you've seen,

629
00:33:34,376 --> 00:33:36,256
We have also used light probes.

630
00:33:36,566 --> 00:33:40,076
You can see these light probes

631
00:33:40,366 --> 00:33:41,896
and we've highlighted them.

632
00:33:41,896 --> 00:33:43,256
You see that only

633
00:33:43,256 --> 00:33:44,686
of view there are

634
00:33:44,686 --> 00:33:46,996
so you can imagine how many

635
00:33:47,606 --> 00:33:49,456
So the custom tools placed them

636
00:33:49,456 --> 00:33:52,476
in the environment

637
00:33:52,476 --> 00:33:56,296
You can also do it by hand

638
00:33:56,366 --> 00:33:59,576
the more light probes you

639
00:34:00,426 --> 00:34:04,096
It's essential for the inside

640
00:34:04,096 --> 00:34:06,096
to the view in the outside

641
00:34:06,096 --> 00:34:08,916
to detect small changes

642
00:34:09,326 --> 00:34:13,886
We have added light

643
00:34:13,976 --> 00:34:15,676
because it overrides

644
00:34:16,186 --> 00:34:19,536
the lighting environment, which

645
00:34:19,536 --> 00:34:21,146
as the light is very

646
00:34:21,146 --> 00:34:24,626
so we have the probes and the

647
00:34:24,626 --> 00:34:26,556
and the mood of this

648
00:34:27,056 --> 00:34:30,806
Of course we use

649
00:34:30,806 --> 00:34:33,996
to add details to the models.

650
00:34:33,996 --> 00:34:36,556
We also use baked

651
00:34:36,835 --> 00:34:40,866
for a very much better

652
00:34:41,416 --> 00:34:45,906
We have one big point

653
00:34:46,246 --> 00:34:48,775
It's very high in the sky

654
00:34:48,775 --> 00:34:51,876
to create dynamic shadows and

655
00:34:51,946 --> 00:34:56,146
As I said, all the

656
00:34:56,146 --> 00:34:59,406
in the demo are 100%

657
00:35:00,066 --> 00:35:04,296
So we get the nice water palms

658
00:35:04,296 --> 00:35:05,216
as well as the crystals.

659
00:35:06,126 --> 00:35:08,216
Talking about crystals,

660
00:35:08,216 --> 00:35:09,896
that we built.

661
00:35:09,896 --> 00:35:12,776
It has no texture map so

662
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:16,196
It's fully metallic and

663
00:35:16,536 --> 00:35:18,196
And just a diffuse color.

664
00:35:18,406 --> 00:35:21,166
So it's a very nice

665
00:35:21,166 --> 00:35:23,246
that reflects the

666
00:35:24,576 --> 00:35:27,546
On the other side of the

667
00:35:27,786 --> 00:35:30,756
which is one object

668
00:35:30,756 --> 00:35:32,536
and nonmetallic parts.

669
00:35:32,696 --> 00:35:35,826
We used, of course,

670
00:35:36,036 --> 00:35:38,096
texture maps to create that.

671
00:35:38,676 --> 00:35:40,676
And, as you see, we

672
00:35:40,676 --> 00:35:44,956
on the normal map to add detail.

673
00:35:45,086 --> 00:35:47,986
So basically the demo used

674
00:35:47,986 --> 00:35:48,496
of SceneKit.

675
00:35:49,506 --> 00:35:52,596
Physically based shading,

676
00:35:52,596 --> 00:35:53,856
for materials, lights.

677
00:35:54,166 --> 00:35:55,866
We used Xcode integration

678
00:35:56,636 --> 00:36:01,226
and also new custom tools

679
00:35:56,636 --> 00:36:01,226
and also new custom tools

680
00:36:01,616 --> 00:36:03,556
And we think it's

681
00:36:03,556 --> 00:36:06,226
for this year's capabilities

682
00:36:06,226 --> 00:36:08,086
for you to learn new things.

683
00:36:08,086 --> 00:36:10,126
And we hope you will

684
00:36:11,056 --> 00:36:12,366
Thank you.

[ Applause ]

686
00:36:17,436 --> 00:36:21,706
So, as you've seen, we've

687
00:36:21,706 --> 00:36:24,176
with materials and

688
00:36:24,666 --> 00:36:28,626
But we also had to change how

689
00:36:28,626 --> 00:36:30,616
that we have great

690
00:36:31,286 --> 00:36:32,926
we also needed a

691
00:36:33,606 --> 00:36:38,006
And now that we have light

692
00:36:38,006 --> 00:36:40,926
to have an HDR camera

693
00:36:41,786 --> 00:36:44,956
because the usual camera used

694
00:36:45,336 --> 00:36:46,776
which is 8-bits per components.

695
00:36:46,776 --> 00:36:51,086
Now we have float per components

696
00:36:51,086 --> 00:36:55,436
very unbright light such as a

697
00:36:55,436 --> 00:36:58,546
for example, the sun which

698
00:36:59,166 --> 00:37:01,536
So this creates a very high

699
00:36:59,166 --> 00:37:01,536
So this creates a very high

700
00:37:01,536 --> 00:37:04,356
to remap to the dynamic

701
00:37:04,916 --> 00:37:06,366
And for that we used

702
00:37:06,656 --> 00:37:10,236
Tone mapping is the action of

703
00:37:10,236 --> 00:37:12,386
to a smaller capability device.

704
00:37:14,536 --> 00:37:16,866
So we need to enable

705
00:37:16,866 --> 00:37:18,476
It's not automatically

706
00:37:18,476 --> 00:37:20,646
You can set that in

707
00:37:20,646 --> 00:37:23,266
And you can configure

708
00:37:23,266 --> 00:37:25,266
You can change the gray

709
00:37:25,456 --> 00:37:27,666
and the range you

710
00:37:28,026 --> 00:37:30,386
And you can also frost

711
00:37:30,546 --> 00:37:33,776
So, for example, you can have

712
00:37:33,776 --> 00:37:37,126
but you can create a low key

713
00:37:37,476 --> 00:37:40,266
or overexpose it, well, but

714
00:37:40,266 --> 00:37:41,026
It's very simple.

715
00:37:41,566 --> 00:37:45,646
We have added also very

716
00:37:45,646 --> 00:37:46,906
to the new HDR camera.

717
00:37:47,406 --> 00:37:49,266
The first one is bloom.

718
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:53,076
Bloom is a way to simulate being

719
00:37:53,346 --> 00:37:55,086
from the scene and reflections.

720
00:37:55,676 --> 00:38:00,636
And it will be created

721
00:37:55,676 --> 00:38:00,636
And it will be created

722
00:38:00,636 --> 00:38:02,236
on the light on the

723
00:38:02,776 --> 00:38:04,836
So you can see in this example

724
00:38:04,836 --> 00:38:08,516
and we can see how it looks

725
00:38:08,516 --> 00:38:09,776
on the roof of the tower.

726
00:38:09,776 --> 00:38:14,186
I think it's a very nice way

727
00:38:14,276 --> 00:38:15,286
on the surrounding pixels.

728
00:38:16,126 --> 00:38:18,706
And it adds a very nice

729
00:38:19,196 --> 00:38:23,936
Next we have added motion blur

730
00:38:24,686 --> 00:38:26,136
So it smoothens the

731
00:38:27,016 --> 00:38:29,686
And the thing is when

732
00:38:29,686 --> 00:38:31,116
to the whole scene

733
00:38:31,216 --> 00:38:34,086
so sometimes we don't

734
00:38:34,196 --> 00:38:36,816
For example, we wanted

735
00:38:37,146 --> 00:38:39,296
to be sharp and crisp.

736
00:38:39,696 --> 00:38:42,486
So we have a new

737
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:45,936
to exclude some objects

738
00:38:46,496 --> 00:38:50,436
and the result gives you a nice,

739
00:38:50,996 --> 00:38:57,086
We have added a couple

740
00:38:57,086 --> 00:38:59,806
from real life camera

741
00:39:00,506 --> 00:39:02,126
The first one is vignetting.

742
00:39:02,426 --> 00:39:07,076
Vignetting is a way to, is an

743
00:39:07,326 --> 00:39:09,826
that creates shades on

744
00:39:10,426 --> 00:39:14,926
So you can change it from

745
00:39:15,126 --> 00:39:16,516
And you can also

746
00:39:16,516 --> 00:39:19,496
to change the filtering going

747
00:39:19,496 --> 00:39:21,346
to the border of the image.

748
00:39:22,466 --> 00:39:25,806
Another aberration we have

749
00:39:25,806 --> 00:39:26,396
color fringe.

750
00:39:26,776 --> 00:39:29,066
Color fringe is a defraction

751
00:39:29,066 --> 00:39:32,016
in real lenses, in the

752
00:39:32,706 --> 00:39:37,596
So it creates a magenta

753
00:39:37,596 --> 00:39:39,686
of the lights in the rendering.

754
00:39:39,686 --> 00:39:41,066
And we go from this

755
00:39:41,376 --> 00:39:42,866
This is a very exaggerated one.

756
00:39:43,076 --> 00:39:45,496
You can go more subtle

757
00:39:45,876 --> 00:39:50,336
We have also added a very

758
00:39:50,336 --> 00:39:51,856
of your scene with

759
00:39:52,336 --> 00:39:53,896
So you can change

760
00:39:53,896 --> 00:39:56,166
go for an almost

761
00:39:56,406 --> 00:39:58,116
or overblow the colors

762
00:39:58,116 --> 00:39:59,976
And you can also change

763
00:40:00,046 --> 00:40:05,526
So you can have the normal

764
00:40:07,046 --> 00:40:09,656
or oversaturated image,

765
00:40:10,146 --> 00:40:17,666
And the last one we have, it's

766
00:40:18,106 --> 00:40:19,276
It's color grading.

767
00:40:19,276 --> 00:40:22,966
Color grading enables us to

768
00:40:22,966 --> 00:40:25,256
of the scene to completely

769
00:40:25,706 --> 00:40:28,646
So we use a strip

770
00:40:28,836 --> 00:40:32,066
to create the 3D color cube

771
00:40:32,626 --> 00:40:35,096
to remap the original

772
00:40:35,096 --> 00:40:39,016
For example, in this case would

773
00:40:39,016 --> 00:40:41,476
on the upper side

774
00:40:41,726 --> 00:40:46,756
So we get this looking like

775
00:40:46,756 --> 00:40:49,686
And it's very simple to use

776
00:40:49,686 --> 00:40:50,516
It's a very nice look.

777
00:40:50,996 --> 00:40:55,066
So that's all we have

778
00:40:55,336 --> 00:40:58,116
We think it's a very

779
00:40:58,566 --> 00:41:00,146
We can't wait to see

780
00:40:58,566 --> 00:41:00,146
We can't wait to see

781
00:41:00,206 --> 00:41:03,776
We got brand new effects that

782
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:05,126
you don't have to

783
00:41:05,126 --> 00:41:06,516
for example, bloom

784
00:41:06,656 --> 00:41:08,166
You can use all at

785
00:41:08,366 --> 00:41:11,416
Of course it has a cost but you

786
00:41:11,816 --> 00:41:14,866
image and very cool

787
00:41:15,876 --> 00:41:17,856
So now I hand over

788
00:41:17,856 --> 00:41:19,916
about Model I/O improvements

789
00:41:20,146 --> 00:41:20,736
Thank you very much.

790
00:41:21,516 --> 00:41:27,556
[ Applause ]

791
00:41:28,056 --> 00:41:28,646
&gt;&gt; All right.

792
00:41:28,876 --> 00:41:29,396
Hi, everybody.

793
00:41:29,826 --> 00:41:31,066
So I'd just like to start

794
00:41:31,066 --> 00:41:35,056
out by covering a little

795
00:41:35,176 --> 00:41:37,986
and output of models

796
00:41:39,166 --> 00:41:43,576
So this year SceneKit

797
00:41:43,666 --> 00:41:46,356
in their native authored

798
00:41:47,026 --> 00:41:50,876
not necessarily just triangles

799
00:41:51,106 --> 00:41:53,826
of quadrilaterals or

800
00:41:53,866 --> 00:41:57,056
that the authors originally

801
00:41:57,606 --> 00:42:00,386
SceneKit, if necessary, will

802
00:41:57,606 --> 00:42:00,386
SceneKit, if necessary, will

803
00:42:00,386 --> 00:42:02,576
for you in order to

804
00:42:03,046 --> 00:42:05,546
And the thing is if you want

805
00:42:05,546 --> 00:42:09,236
to use our new tessellation

806
00:42:09,306 --> 00:42:12,686
to have accurate

807
00:42:12,686 --> 00:42:13,886
So you'll need to opt-in,

808
00:42:14,286 --> 00:42:16,396
using the preserved

809
00:42:16,856 --> 00:42:19,216
That flag corresponds to

810
00:42:19,496 --> 00:42:22,586
and you bring in the

811
00:42:22,586 --> 00:42:24,976
It will preserve holes, and

812
00:42:24,976 --> 00:42:25,546
that are important

813
00:42:25,546 --> 00:42:27,916
for an accurate rendition

814
00:42:29,066 --> 00:42:33,606
Now this year we have improved

815
00:42:33,766 --> 00:42:37,636
to the new system and

816
00:42:37,686 --> 00:42:39,156
You can see in this example here

817
00:42:39,426 --> 00:42:41,966
that previously we would

818
00:42:41,966 --> 00:42:45,426
and when you do the tessellation

819
00:42:45,426 --> 00:42:47,336
to smoothly subdivide comes

820
00:42:47,966 --> 00:42:50,496
Now if you bring it in

821
00:42:50,846 --> 00:42:57,116
you can see that the quads go

822
00:42:57,116 --> 00:42:58,126
and it looks very nice.

823
00:42:58,596 --> 00:43:00,906
So this kind of facility

824
00:42:58,596 --> 00:43:00,906
So this kind of facility

825
00:43:01,086 --> 00:43:04,646
for having lightweight objects

826
00:43:04,966 --> 00:43:06,396
to your scene, and

827
00:43:06,916 --> 00:43:11,156
Now the other aspect of

828
00:43:11,156 --> 00:43:15,336
to emphasize is that last year

829
00:43:15,506 --> 00:43:17,106
materials and things

830
00:43:17,406 --> 00:43:21,296
They bridge naturally onto

831
00:43:21,296 --> 00:43:24,516
So if you have a high

832
00:43:24,936 --> 00:43:26,886
in Model I/O, it

833
00:43:27,156 --> 00:43:28,616
and without losing

834
00:43:30,436 --> 00:43:33,016
So on to Model I/O.

835
00:43:33,016 --> 00:43:34,066
Yeah. Quick refresher.

836
00:43:34,826 --> 00:43:37,806
As it says on the [inaudible],

837
00:43:37,806 --> 00:43:42,226
of models onto our

838
00:43:42,306 --> 00:43:45,586
Need this so obviously to

839
00:43:45,586 --> 00:43:48,596
where you've created

840
00:43:48,646 --> 00:43:50,706
between frameworks,

841
00:43:50,706 --> 00:43:52,016
and MetalKit, and so on.

842
00:43:52,526 --> 00:43:56,656
And we provide support for a

843
00:43:57,066 --> 00:44:01,386
Now file formats are the

844
00:43:57,066 --> 00:44:01,386
Now file formats are the

845
00:44:01,386 --> 00:44:03,366
from your art program

846
00:44:03,366 --> 00:44:05,296
And historically the formats

847
00:44:05,446 --> 00:44:08,026
that we had have been

848
00:44:08,216 --> 00:44:10,606
For example, they might

849
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:12,496
Or they just might

850
00:44:12,996 --> 00:44:16,566
Now really exciting thing that

851
00:44:16,846 --> 00:44:21,206
we're bringing to you, is in

852
00:44:21,206 --> 00:44:23,406
at Pixar we're introducing

853
00:44:23,716 --> 00:44:25,436
for Universal Scene Description.

854
00:44:26,476 --> 00:44:32,116
Now Universal Scene Description

855
00:44:32,796 --> 00:44:36,586
And the thing that's really

856
00:44:36,586 --> 00:44:41,946
about it is it's not only

857
00:44:42,236 --> 00:44:45,666
that can be either easy to

858
00:44:45,836 --> 00:44:47,116
for loading in binary

859
00:44:47,666 --> 00:44:51,086
but it also includes a

860
00:44:51,586 --> 00:44:53,096
That really distinguishes it

861
00:44:53,326 --> 00:44:55,246
from any other format

862
00:44:55,786 --> 00:44:58,676
It embodies years of practical

863
00:44:58,676 --> 00:45:00,676
Pixar uses this for their films.

864
00:44:58,676 --> 00:45:00,676
Pixar uses this for their films.

865
00:45:01,026 --> 00:45:03,436
And "Finding Dory,"

866
00:45:03,436 --> 00:45:06,826
is rendered entirely

867
00:45:07,426 --> 00:45:10,866
Now USD has data types that

868
00:45:11,326 --> 00:45:14,366
And it introduces, once

869
00:45:14,436 --> 00:45:17,316
as an open format,

870
00:45:17,716 --> 00:45:19,506
to enable concurrent workflows.

871
00:45:19,926 --> 00:45:23,746
Now concurrent workflows is

872
00:45:25,186 --> 00:45:29,166
Here is a representation

873
00:45:29,166 --> 00:45:32,136
in Universal Scene Description

874
00:45:32,716 --> 00:45:36,946
We have a shot layer, the

875
00:45:37,166 --> 00:45:39,496
from components,

876
00:45:39,496 --> 00:45:42,046
The characters themselves might

877
00:45:42,616 --> 00:45:44,966
Now you can see there's

878
00:45:44,966 --> 00:45:45,926
of a shot layer there.

879
00:45:46,166 --> 00:45:49,696
That's because not only can you

880
00:45:49,696 --> 00:45:53,036
of these things composed,

881
00:45:53,106 --> 00:45:56,316
And so the scene description

882
00:45:56,316 --> 00:45:58,726
like take three, maybe

883
00:45:58,726 --> 00:46:00,426
in a little bit faster

884
00:45:58,726 --> 00:46:00,426
in a little bit faster

885
00:46:00,836 --> 00:46:03,396
And you can have all of

886
00:46:03,396 --> 00:46:05,726
in one file and for review.

887
00:46:06,836 --> 00:46:11,646
Now another really unique aspect

888
00:46:12,186 --> 00:46:15,146
to Universal Scene Description

889
00:46:15,146 --> 00:46:16,696
it's the only open

890
00:46:17,086 --> 00:46:20,856
that allows the specification

891
00:46:20,856 --> 00:46:22,316
in variations of objects.

892
00:46:22,776 --> 00:46:26,006
Now, you can imagine that

893
00:46:26,006 --> 00:46:27,806
of a situation where you

894
00:46:27,806 --> 00:46:29,256
and they all want to go

895
00:46:29,256 --> 00:46:30,096
and there's like books.

896
00:46:30,586 --> 00:46:34,336
Now in a traditional

897
00:46:34,336 --> 00:46:37,136
to find yourself creating

898
00:46:37,236 --> 00:46:39,096
slaving out millions and

899
00:46:39,096 --> 00:46:41,596
for every little book, and then

900
00:46:41,596 --> 00:46:44,076
and getting it out for

901
00:46:44,606 --> 00:46:46,436
Now that is tedious.

902
00:46:46,646 --> 00:46:49,946
In games you have things

903
00:46:49,946 --> 00:46:52,796
maybe they all differ in

904
00:46:53,196 --> 00:46:55,586
And you might have to

905
00:46:55,586 --> 00:46:59,586
Now Universal Scene Description

906
00:46:59,586 --> 00:47:01,946
in a single file

907
00:46:59,586 --> 00:47:01,946
in a single file

908
00:47:02,016 --> 00:47:08,116
So the class represented

909
00:47:08,116 --> 00:47:13,446
So the file can represent

910
00:47:13,446 --> 00:47:15,066
interpretations of books.

911
00:47:15,386 --> 00:47:17,006
Like you obviously

912
00:47:17,006 --> 00:47:18,866
and a tall one, and a thick one.

913
00:47:19,576 --> 00:47:22,836
And when you instantiate

914
00:47:22,836 --> 00:47:25,736
into the bookcase you can tell

915
00:47:26,016 --> 00:47:29,546
"I want this book and I want it

916
00:47:29,546 --> 00:47:31,696
And it will provide the

917
00:47:31,696 --> 00:47:35,026
to instantiate that

918
00:47:35,026 --> 00:47:36,716
or your shot, or whatever.

919
00:47:39,266 --> 00:47:41,706
The variations that you can have

920
00:47:41,706 --> 00:47:46,126
in a single file can

921
00:47:46,486 --> 00:47:48,876
In this case I'm changing

922
00:47:48,996 --> 00:47:51,146
So previously I had

923
00:47:51,146 --> 00:47:52,826
I can make them whatever

924
00:47:53,356 --> 00:47:58,296
And the magic of that is I place

925
00:47:58,426 --> 00:48:00,796
for the purposes of rendering,

926
00:47:58,426 --> 00:48:00,796
for the purposes of rendering,

927
00:48:00,796 --> 00:48:02,436
on the shelf in this place?"

928
00:48:02,686 --> 00:48:05,596
it will work out,

929
00:48:05,806 --> 00:48:09,466
about scene composition that

930
00:48:10,066 --> 00:48:11,896
the way that it should

931
00:48:13,116 --> 00:48:16,796
Now beyond that you can

932
00:48:16,976 --> 00:48:19,626
in a single file,

933
00:48:19,946 --> 00:48:23,656
So what I'm showing here is

934
00:48:23,656 --> 00:48:27,806
like say for a wearable device,

935
00:48:27,916 --> 00:48:31,566
The same file can have one

936
00:48:32,396 --> 00:48:35,266
in the highest rendering

937
00:48:36,136 --> 00:48:40,986
Now we've integrated Universal

938
00:48:40,986 --> 00:48:42,206
of our systems and frameworks.

939
00:48:42,866 --> 00:48:46,476
So at a very nuts

940
00:48:46,686 --> 00:48:49,016
If you import a Universal

941
00:48:49,136 --> 00:48:51,886
into Model I/O -- I don't expect

942
00:48:52,036 --> 00:48:53,976
you're going to be

943
00:48:54,226 --> 00:48:56,706
of familiar Model I/O objects

944
00:48:56,706 --> 00:48:59,056
that were in the Universal

945
00:48:59,056 --> 00:49:02,116
represented so that you can

946
00:48:59,056 --> 00:49:02,116
represented so that you can

947
00:49:02,116 --> 00:49:05,606
in Model I/O, such as

948
00:49:05,606 --> 00:49:08,056
and evaluating them

949
00:49:10,286 --> 00:49:15,806
However, beyond that, let's say

950
00:49:15,806 --> 00:49:18,256
and your art team just gave

951
00:49:19,136 --> 00:49:22,746
You can just open that window

952
00:49:22,746 --> 00:49:25,846
that you just got and Finder

953
00:49:25,846 --> 00:49:26,916
so you can see what's there.

954
00:49:27,326 --> 00:49:29,166
And Quick Look works

955
00:49:29,166 --> 00:49:32,016
So you can select one of these

956
00:49:32,016 --> 00:49:34,486
and it'll pop up and

957
00:49:34,486 --> 00:49:38,156
Now, of course Quick Look

958
00:49:38,366 --> 00:49:40,916
If you want to hold

959
00:49:40,916 --> 00:49:44,086
or maybe your USD file has

960
00:49:44,086 --> 00:49:46,696
in it that you want to inspect

961
00:49:46,696 --> 00:49:50,506
that up in preview and Universal

962
00:49:50,506 --> 00:49:50,976
great there.

963
00:49:51,056 --> 00:49:55,896
And if you're bringing

964
00:49:55,896 --> 00:50:00,786
into Xcode, it imports via

965
00:49:55,896 --> 00:50:00,786
into Xcode, it imports via

966
00:50:00,786 --> 00:50:03,126
with an exact representation

967
00:50:03,266 --> 00:50:06,496
so that you can inspect it

968
00:50:06,686 --> 00:50:07,896
you can look at the properties,

969
00:50:08,126 --> 00:50:11,086
you can move things

970
00:50:11,086 --> 00:50:13,026
You make edit scenes,

971
00:50:13,026 --> 00:50:16,576
And then you can send it back

972
00:50:16,576 --> 00:50:17,966
you know, I've got

973
00:50:17,966 --> 00:50:19,336
Can you, do you know the rep?"

974
00:50:20,526 --> 00:50:25,496
So finally, it's

975
00:50:25,496 --> 00:50:27,806
And so friends at Pixar supplied

976
00:50:27,806 --> 00:50:30,056
up with Mr. Ray from

977
00:50:30,616 --> 00:50:34,126
And this is just stock

978
00:50:34,126 --> 00:50:36,186
with the new physically

979
00:50:36,296 --> 00:50:37,566
that you just heard all about.

980
00:50:37,996 --> 00:50:42,786
And we're just playing the

981
00:50:42,786 --> 00:50:45,326
of animation, and it

982
00:50:46,856 --> 00:50:51,366
So plugins are the thing that

983
00:50:51,366 --> 00:50:53,626
to incorporate Universal Scene

984
00:50:54,086 --> 00:50:57,756
So that will enable the motion

985
00:50:57,946 --> 00:51:00,546
your content creation programs,

986
00:50:57,946 --> 00:51:00,546
your content creation programs,

987
00:51:01,146 --> 00:51:04,666
Now the plugins, and the

988
00:51:04,836 --> 00:51:07,646
and all availability,

989
00:51:07,856 --> 00:51:12,296
are available on the openusd.org

990
00:51:12,296 --> 00:51:14,536
to go visit to find out

991
00:51:14,886 --> 00:51:16,766
in your pipelines and processes.

992
00:51:17,246 --> 00:51:19,976
So that's Universal

[ Applause ]

994
00:51:28,116 --> 00:51:29,096
So a quick summary.

995
00:51:29,936 --> 00:51:33,246
SceneKit is available

996
00:51:33,346 --> 00:51:34,516
on every platform.

997
00:51:34,786 --> 00:51:35,916
It's kind of an amazing thing.

998
00:51:36,456 --> 00:51:38,796
We have physically based

999
00:51:38,796 --> 00:51:42,686
of the art looks and state

1000
00:51:42,736 --> 00:51:43,696
just a beautiful look.

1001
00:51:43,916 --> 00:51:47,726
And HDR cameras and

1002
00:51:47,726 --> 00:51:49,376
over how things are represented

1003
00:51:49,376 --> 00:51:50,996
and how they look,

1004
00:51:51,676 --> 00:51:55,726
And we've got support for

1005
00:51:56,136 --> 00:51:59,426
which we're really happy to

1006
00:51:59,426 --> 00:52:01,466
to make a big difference

1007
00:51:59,426 --> 00:52:01,466
to make a big difference

1008
00:52:02,046 --> 00:52:06,636
in coming days and months.

1009
00:52:06,766 --> 00:52:08,946

1010
00:52:09,086 --> 00:52:10,806
