3
00:00:27,336 --> 00:00:28,046
&gt;&gt; Hello, everybody.

4
00:00:28,646 --> 00:00:32,296
My name is Mike Stern, and

5
00:00:32,296 --> 00:00:32,746
at Apple.

6
00:00:33,506 --> 00:00:36,006
And it's a great pleasure

7
00:00:36,006 --> 00:00:37,756
about designing for Apple Watch.

8
00:00:38,636 --> 00:00:40,736
Now, in today's session,

9
00:00:40,736 --> 00:00:42,826
to apply design best practices

10
00:00:43,216 --> 00:00:46,306
and leverage the new

11
00:00:46,796 --> 00:00:49,946
to design Apple Watch

12
00:00:50,396 --> 00:00:52,126
focused, and delightful.

13
00:00:52,126 --> 00:00:56,186
But before we get there, I

14
00:00:57,176 --> 00:01:00,486
Now, after all, some of you

15
00:00:57,176 --> 00:01:00,486
Now, after all, some of you

16
00:01:00,486 --> 00:01:01,246
watchOS app.

17
00:01:02,326 --> 00:01:05,176
There are three basic components

18
00:01:05,836 --> 00:01:09,216
complications, notifications,

19
00:01:09,616 --> 00:01:12,266
A complication is

20
00:01:12,446 --> 00:01:14,666
that people can display

21
00:01:15,536 --> 00:01:18,766
The term complication comes

22
00:01:19,106 --> 00:01:21,106
and it refers to any feature

23
00:01:21,106 --> 00:01:24,686
on a timepiece beyond the

24
00:01:25,436 --> 00:01:28,576
Complications made the

25
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:31,296
and repair of watches

26
00:01:31,776 --> 00:01:34,326
and more complicated,

27
00:01:35,086 --> 00:01:37,696
Now, fortunately for you,

28
00:01:37,696 --> 00:01:41,456
to make for Apple Watch and

29
00:01:42,366 --> 00:01:45,606
Complications on Apple

30
00:01:45,886 --> 00:01:47,736
for people to access information

31
00:01:47,736 --> 00:01:50,776
and provide a really

32
00:01:51,546 --> 00:01:54,896
Notifications tell people

33
00:01:54,896 --> 00:01:56,606
that they might otherwise

34
00:01:57,176 --> 00:02:00,266
And because they're also

35
00:01:57,176 --> 00:02:00,266
And because they're also

36
00:02:00,266 --> 00:02:02,976
to push interactions to the

37
00:02:03,976 --> 00:02:07,096
And lastly, apps offer

38
00:02:07,096 --> 00:02:08,925
with your product or service.

39
00:02:09,556 --> 00:02:11,746
Now, providing a complication

40
00:02:11,746 --> 00:02:15,786
or making watch-specific

41
00:02:15,786 --> 00:02:17,076
to also have an app.

42
00:02:18,316 --> 00:02:21,716
These three basic components

43
00:02:22,256 --> 00:02:24,806
Each plays an integral role

44
00:02:24,806 --> 00:02:27,856
in the overall user

45
00:02:28,556 --> 00:02:30,016
So, for example, let's say

46
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,976
that I'm ordering

47
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:36,086
I might start out by tapping

48
00:02:36,326 --> 00:02:37,096
to launch the app.

49
00:02:37,096 --> 00:02:40,346
I then use the app

50
00:02:40,686 --> 00:02:43,766
And after doing that, I would

51
00:02:44,076 --> 00:02:46,886
with a time estimate about

52
00:02:47,866 --> 00:02:49,586
While I wait for

53
00:02:49,776 --> 00:02:51,996
I might periodically

54
00:02:52,386 --> 00:02:54,506
to see how much longer

55
00:02:55,266 --> 00:02:57,536
And when my order

56
00:02:58,066 --> 00:03:00,786
I might get another

57
00:02:58,066 --> 00:03:00,786
I might get another

58
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:05,086
And finally, if I hadn't already

59
00:03:05,446 --> 00:03:07,536
I might get a notification

60
00:03:07,536 --> 00:03:08,726
if I would like to do so.

61
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:13,086
So that's the basics

62
00:03:13,636 --> 00:03:15,846
Now this presentation

63
00:03:15,846 --> 00:03:17,886
to design each of these well.

64
00:03:18,736 --> 00:03:22,996
But before we get there, there's

65
00:03:23,686 --> 00:03:26,876
even more fundamental, that

66
00:03:27,456 --> 00:03:29,626
And that's the concept of time.

67
00:03:30,616 --> 00:03:32,886
Apple Watch was specifically

68
00:03:32,886 --> 00:03:34,706
to support lightweight

69
00:03:35,226 --> 00:03:37,616
meaning that people should

70
00:03:37,616 --> 00:03:40,806
and take action in very,

71
00:03:41,546 --> 00:03:44,886
Now I suppose this is an obvious

72
00:03:44,886 --> 00:03:46,016
to lose sight of this.

73
00:03:46,276 --> 00:03:48,616
Of just how quick

74
00:03:48,616 --> 00:03:49,946
when you're designing comps

75
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:52,406
or testing your builds

76
00:03:52,406 --> 00:03:57,406
Now as you design your app,

77
00:03:57,406 --> 00:04:00,916
to find faster and less

78
00:03:57,406 --> 00:04:00,916
to find faster and less

79
00:04:01,566 --> 00:04:03,646
There's always a

80
00:04:04,266 --> 00:04:05,726
For instance, many

81
00:04:05,726 --> 00:04:07,706
of our built-in apps

82
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:08,946
and quicker to navigate.

83
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:12,066
Previously, starting a

84
00:04:12,066 --> 00:04:14,516
to the Home screen,

85
00:04:14,736 --> 00:04:18,016
select a workout type, pick

86
00:04:18,286 --> 00:04:20,946
that you used last,

87
00:04:21,906 --> 00:04:24,106
The new flow is much simpler,

88
00:04:24,626 --> 00:04:27,256
especially if you use

89
00:04:27,376 --> 00:04:28,846
You just tap the complication,

90
00:04:29,216 --> 00:04:30,976
then click Start,

91
00:04:31,736 --> 00:04:35,106
Now Quick Start lets

92
00:04:35,106 --> 00:04:37,846
for selecting their workout

93
00:04:37,846 --> 00:04:39,136
for a separate Start button.

94
00:04:39,836 --> 00:04:43,136
Now most people workout the

95
00:04:43,546 --> 00:04:45,936
So, for those people,

96
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,506
to start a workout.

97
00:04:47,506 --> 00:04:50,146
And the UI shown

98
00:04:50,146 --> 00:04:53,796
out has also been optimized

99
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:56,386
Previously, there

100
00:04:56,746 --> 00:04:57,916
that people could swipe through.

101
00:04:58,346 --> 00:05:01,676
One for controls, and one for

102
00:04:58,346 --> 00:05:01,676
One for controls, and one for

103
00:05:02,156 --> 00:05:05,286
And navigating between these

104
00:05:05,286 --> 00:05:07,286
much time.

105
00:05:07,496 --> 00:05:11,946
In watchOS 3, there's just two

106
00:05:12,626 --> 00:05:15,546
There's basically no need to

107
00:05:15,546 --> 00:05:17,936
with your workout or if

108
00:05:18,456 --> 00:05:20,666
Now this frees people

109
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:23,176
on what's most important

110
00:05:23,176 --> 00:05:25,036
for a run or riding their bike.

111
00:05:25,566 --> 00:05:28,956
Focus on your cadence,

112
00:05:30,086 --> 00:05:32,236
Look out for cars, pedestrians.

113
00:05:32,806 --> 00:05:35,166
Enjoy the scenery,

114
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:38,586
With watchOS 3, the

115
00:05:38,586 --> 00:05:41,746
and engineering team rallied

116
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:45,526
for this release which I

117
00:05:46,266 --> 00:05:51,016
Those themes are glanceable,

118
00:05:52,106 --> 00:05:54,006
Glanceable means

119
00:05:54,006 --> 00:05:56,216
so that it's immediately

120
00:05:56,786 --> 00:06:00,846
Your design must communicate

121
00:05:56,786 --> 00:06:00,846
Your design must communicate

122
00:06:01,556 --> 00:06:03,996
You should only display

123
00:06:03,996 --> 00:06:05,116
most relevant.

124
00:06:06,196 --> 00:06:07,386
Ideally, the information

125
00:06:07,386 --> 00:06:09,846
that your app displays

126
00:06:10,366 --> 00:06:14,496
This means inspiring people to

127
00:06:14,496 --> 00:06:18,656
to what your app communicates,

128
00:06:18,656 --> 00:06:22,446
to access functionality from

129
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:25,786
And apps should be responsive.

130
00:06:26,376 --> 00:06:28,656
Launch times and screen

131
00:06:28,656 --> 00:06:29,926
to an absolute minimum.

132
00:06:30,526 --> 00:06:33,136
Content and data should

133
00:06:33,536 --> 00:06:35,846
and UI feedback should

134
00:06:37,176 --> 00:06:40,036
Now to help your apps be

135
00:06:40,036 --> 00:06:42,776
and responsive, major

136
00:06:42,776 --> 00:06:46,956
to the navigational model and

137
00:06:47,716 --> 00:06:50,936
The new Dock provides people

138
00:06:51,336 --> 00:06:54,486
of timely and

139
00:06:54,576 --> 00:06:55,836
from their favorite apps.

140
00:06:56,586 --> 00:06:58,396
Apps in the Dock

141
00:06:58,436 --> 00:07:01,136
and can periodically

142
00:06:58,436 --> 00:07:01,136
and can periodically

143
00:07:01,436 --> 00:07:06,446
which means that navigating to

144
00:07:07,106 --> 00:07:09,386
and people will spend

145
00:07:09,446 --> 00:07:12,376
for app content to update.

146
00:07:12,376 --> 00:07:15,196
And once you're in an app,

147
00:07:15,196 --> 00:07:16,516
between detail screens,

148
00:07:16,516 --> 00:07:19,536
which greatly reduces the

149
00:07:20,366 --> 00:07:23,846
These changes can

150
00:07:23,846 --> 00:07:24,846
interaction time.

151
00:07:25,536 --> 00:07:29,716
In fact, with watchOS 3 our

152
00:07:29,986 --> 00:07:33,266
was reduced from 5

153
00:07:34,096 --> 00:07:37,936
Now, admittedly, the first time

154
00:07:38,066 --> 00:07:39,886
"That is pretty ambitious."

155
00:07:40,356 --> 00:07:43,136
I mean, it literally

156
00:07:43,136 --> 00:07:45,116
to say the words "2 seconds".

157
00:07:46,046 --> 00:07:48,806
But, the truth is

158
00:07:48,806 --> 00:07:53,306
like checking scores for a

159
00:07:53,676 --> 00:07:57,996
or checking stocks can

160
00:07:59,136 --> 00:08:01,116
Now, throughout the day,

161
00:07:59,136 --> 00:08:01,116
Now, throughout the day,

162
00:08:01,116 --> 00:08:05,526
than a few seconds checking

163
00:08:05,956 --> 00:08:09,176
But each of those interactions

164
00:08:09,176 --> 00:08:09,816
of seconds.

165
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:14,216
And taking action

166
00:08:14,216 --> 00:08:18,456
Simple actions that only require

167
00:08:18,576 --> 00:08:19,536
on Apple Watch.

168
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:26,216
People should be able to set

169
00:08:28,076 --> 00:08:31,076
or check things off on

170
00:08:31,506 --> 00:08:33,436
in 2 seconds or less.

171
00:08:34,525 --> 00:08:37,066
Now even if you can't

172
00:08:37,066 --> 00:08:40,056
down to 2 seconds, the

173
00:08:40,056 --> 00:08:44,356
so will help you spot workflow

174
00:08:44,426 --> 00:08:46,226
to streamline your app.

175
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:50,386
All right, so now let's get

176
00:08:50,386 --> 00:08:51,786
to make really great apps,

177
00:08:52,416 --> 00:08:55,456
notifications, and

178
00:08:56,466 --> 00:09:00,696
Now, in my humble opinion,

179
00:08:56,466 --> 00:09:00,696
Now, in my humble opinion,

180
00:09:00,696 --> 00:09:02,496
and most glanceable interaction

181
00:09:02,806 --> 00:09:04,896
that someone can

182
00:09:05,866 --> 00:09:08,006
Checking a complication

183
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:10,366
as raising one's

184
00:09:11,126 --> 00:09:13,776
No additional interaction

185
00:09:14,186 --> 00:09:15,986
This is definitely

186
00:09:15,986 --> 00:09:17,626
that takes 2 seconds or less.

187
00:09:18,346 --> 00:09:22,636
And with watchOS 3 and iOS

188
00:09:22,876 --> 00:09:25,016
to raise awareness

189
00:09:25,876 --> 00:09:28,126
to make them easier to install

190
00:09:28,126 --> 00:09:30,426
and to give them

191
00:09:31,206 --> 00:09:35,156
So, for starters, you can now

192
00:09:35,736 --> 00:09:39,356
to browse and configure

193
00:09:39,356 --> 00:09:41,696
of sense because this is

194
00:09:42,036 --> 00:09:43,666
which takes more than 2 seconds.

195
00:09:44,576 --> 00:09:47,276
Now the configuration UI

196
00:09:47,576 --> 00:09:50,066
of how the complication

197
00:09:50,626 --> 00:09:53,146
and it's easy for people to

198
00:09:53,546 --> 00:09:55,376
and the value it

199
00:09:56,616 --> 00:09:59,376
The Apple Watch app also

200
00:09:59,806 --> 00:10:02,186
that are preconfigured

201
00:09:59,806 --> 00:10:02,186
that are preconfigured

202
00:10:03,046 --> 00:10:06,896
And there's a section dedicated

203
00:10:07,426 --> 00:10:09,596
Now if you've made a

204
00:10:09,596 --> 00:10:14,046
Apple Watch owners who have your

205
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:15,736
see your complication here.

206
00:10:16,346 --> 00:10:18,196
If your complication

207
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:20,766
people can simply

208
00:10:20,766 --> 00:10:24,106
And this will install your

209
00:10:24,966 --> 00:10:27,686
The feature complication

210
00:10:27,686 --> 00:10:30,196
to raise awareness

211
00:10:30,816 --> 00:10:33,546
It will now be so much

212
00:10:33,546 --> 00:10:37,076
about the complications

213
00:10:37,296 --> 00:10:41,186
Now another big change has

214
00:10:42,346 --> 00:10:44,186
Any app with a complication

215
00:10:44,886 --> 00:10:47,916
on the user's current watch

216
00:10:48,326 --> 00:10:51,136
and have more background

217
00:10:51,676 --> 00:10:54,156
This means that launch time

218
00:10:54,546 --> 00:10:57,366
and app data should

219
00:10:58,026 --> 00:11:01,436
Complications are great app

220
00:10:58,026 --> 00:11:01,436
Complications are great app

221
00:11:01,436 --> 00:11:03,986
that they display

222
00:11:03,986 --> 00:11:05,246
to want to know more.

223
00:11:05,496 --> 00:11:07,076
So that process has to be quick.

224
00:11:07,626 --> 00:11:09,776
So seeing the current

225
00:11:09,776 --> 00:11:12,716
curious about this

226
00:11:13,896 --> 00:11:17,276
Or, seeing that your primary

227
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:19,896
make you want to know how

228
00:11:19,896 --> 00:11:25,086
And the last big change

229
00:11:25,086 --> 00:11:26,866
to the frequency of updates.

230
00:11:27,476 --> 00:11:30,586
In watchOS 3, your

231
00:11:30,586 --> 00:11:33,986
to update your complication

232
00:11:34,756 --> 00:11:38,386
You control the frequency

233
00:11:39,056 --> 00:11:42,326
So a travel complication

234
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:45,106
around the departure and

235
00:11:46,046 --> 00:11:49,246
while a sport complication

236
00:11:49,246 --> 00:11:50,776
around a game that

237
00:11:51,506 --> 00:11:53,316
By controlling when

238
00:11:53,506 --> 00:11:57,206
your complication can stay

239
00:11:58,096 --> 00:11:59,786
Now as you work on

240
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:02,216
consider how external factors

241
00:12:02,216 --> 00:12:06,456
and user activity patterns

242
00:12:06,636 --> 00:12:10,316
of your complication updates.

243
00:12:11,196 --> 00:12:15,336
So, if you're going to

244
00:12:16,436 --> 00:12:18,156
you should make a complication.

245
00:12:19,016 --> 00:12:20,886
There's a reason why they became

246
00:12:20,886 --> 00:12:24,606
so popular among watch

247
00:12:25,276 --> 00:12:28,286
All of that complexity

248
00:12:29,306 --> 00:12:32,816
So I hope I've done a decent

249
00:12:32,816 --> 00:12:34,526
on the idea of making

250
00:12:35,036 --> 00:12:37,166
And if so, I'd like to

251
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:40,386
about what it takes to make

252
00:12:40,876 --> 00:12:44,086
Now the most important

253
00:12:44,246 --> 00:12:48,076
when designing a complication is

254
00:12:48,076 --> 00:12:48,706
to display.

255
00:12:49,796 --> 00:12:52,836
The best complications answer

256
00:12:52,836 --> 00:12:54,976
to ask themselves

257
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:58,296
Now I run most days

258
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:00,916
So the night before,

259
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:00,916
So the night before,

260
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:04,756
to see what time the sun

261
00:13:04,756 --> 00:13:05,386
alarm clock.

262
00:13:05,386 --> 00:13:07,446
And when I get up, I want

263
00:13:07,446 --> 00:13:08,946
to know what the

264
00:13:08,946 --> 00:13:10,426
so I know how to

265
00:13:11,406 --> 00:13:13,726
And I'll check to see what

266
00:13:13,786 --> 00:13:16,246
to make sure I have

267
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:18,516
And I'll also check

268
00:13:18,816 --> 00:13:20,396
to make sure I don't need

269
00:13:20,396 --> 00:13:21,986
to leave really early

270
00:13:23,056 --> 00:13:27,056
Now the answers to these

271
00:13:27,146 --> 00:13:28,526
how I plan my day.

272
00:13:29,246 --> 00:13:32,466
And by answering these questions

273
00:13:32,466 --> 00:13:35,426
of the wrist, these

274
00:13:35,426 --> 00:13:37,846
and immediate value

275
00:13:37,846 --> 00:13:42,646
And complications can be a

276
00:13:43,146 --> 00:13:45,736
They can inspire

277
00:13:46,306 --> 00:13:47,406
More actionable.

278
00:13:48,086 --> 00:13:50,926
The Activity complication,

279
00:13:50,926 --> 00:13:54,166
shows me progress towards

280
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:54,456
the day.

281
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:58,066
I can see if I'm on track

282
00:13:58,636 --> 00:14:01,006
or if I need to go

283
00:13:58,636 --> 00:14:01,006
or if I need to go

284
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:02,366
with my dogs after work.

285
00:14:03,356 --> 00:14:06,886
And WaterMinder's complication

286
00:14:06,886 --> 00:14:08,946
making towards my

287
00:14:09,926 --> 00:14:12,706
And it seems I'm actually a

288
00:14:12,706 --> 00:14:15,416
to take this as an

289
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:16,506
Hold on one second.

290
00:14:23,296 --> 00:14:23,363
Ahh.

291
00:14:24,516 --> 00:14:26,516
[ Laughter ]

292
00:14:27,516 --> 00:14:30,846
[ Applause ]

293
00:14:31,346 --> 00:14:35,886
So, if you had to pick just

294
00:14:36,296 --> 00:14:38,556
with your complication

295
00:14:38,556 --> 00:14:41,256
that use your app,

296
00:14:41,996 --> 00:14:44,196
What's the thing that

297
00:14:44,196 --> 00:14:46,036
in knowing throughout

298
00:14:46,906 --> 00:14:49,236
Does that information

299
00:14:49,336 --> 00:14:50,736
to remain interesting?

300
00:14:51,516 --> 00:14:55,306
Now, sometimes, the answer to

301
00:14:56,296 --> 00:14:59,586
Now if you can't quite narrow

302
00:14:59,586 --> 00:15:02,716
of information, consider

303
00:14:59,586 --> 00:15:02,716
of information, consider

304
00:15:03,556 --> 00:15:05,686
That's what the app

305
00:15:06,486 --> 00:15:08,106
They let you configure what type

306
00:15:08,106 --> 00:15:09,896
of weather information

307
00:15:10,356 --> 00:15:14,766
Temperature, temperature and

308
00:15:15,196 --> 00:15:18,526
precipitation, chance of

309
00:15:19,356 --> 00:15:21,116
Now during the summertime

310
00:15:21,116 --> 00:15:24,346
in California, it

311
00:15:24,766 --> 00:15:25,726
So seeing the chance

312
00:15:25,726 --> 00:15:28,976
of precipitation is

313
00:15:29,776 --> 00:15:33,126
0% today. That is

314
00:15:33,686 --> 00:15:36,186
Of course, just as an aside, I

315
00:15:36,186 --> 00:15:37,966
It's actually supposed

316
00:15:38,326 --> 00:15:40,966
So, heads up.

317
00:15:42,036 --> 00:15:42,636
Just in time.

318
00:15:43,156 --> 00:15:47,066
But, you know, during the same

319
00:15:47,466 --> 00:15:52,026
the UV index is incredibly

320
00:15:52,506 --> 00:15:54,176
And allowing this complication

321
00:15:54,176 --> 00:15:57,146
to be customizable is

322
00:15:57,846 --> 00:16:00,426
And CARROT Weather has

323
00:15:57,846 --> 00:16:00,426
And CARROT Weather has

324
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:03,096
of making their complication

325
00:16:03,936 --> 00:16:06,696
Each one, except for

326
00:16:07,076 --> 00:16:09,686
uses a simple and

327
00:16:09,686 --> 00:16:11,346
to label the value that's shown.

328
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:14,976
And they don't try to cram in

329
00:16:14,976 --> 00:16:17,126
because that would just

330
00:16:17,516 --> 00:16:18,766
that are too small to read.

331
00:16:20,156 --> 00:16:22,016
Now if you haven't made

332
00:16:22,626 --> 00:16:23,716
it's important to know

333
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:26,276
that there are multiple

334
00:16:26,906 --> 00:16:29,946
Circular, modular

335
00:16:30,076 --> 00:16:32,466
utility small, and

336
00:16:33,226 --> 00:16:37,026
And new to watchOS

337
00:16:37,716 --> 00:16:39,856
I wanted to get a

338
00:16:39,856 --> 00:16:41,066
but I didn't have time.

339
00:16:41,796 --> 00:16:44,956
Now each of these complication

340
00:16:44,956 --> 00:16:47,796
or more complication

341
00:16:47,796 --> 00:16:49,246
to particular watch faces.

342
00:16:49,806 --> 00:16:53,476
The Color watch face uses the

343
00:16:54,586 --> 00:16:58,336
The modular watch face uses

344
00:16:58,336 --> 00:17:01,476
family and the modular

345
00:16:58,336 --> 00:17:01,476
family and the modular

346
00:17:02,546 --> 00:17:03,916
The simple utility

347
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:07,866
and chronograph watch faces use

348
00:17:08,506 --> 00:17:13,336
And the utility and Mickey watch

349
00:17:13,425 --> 00:17:14,435
complication family.

350
00:17:16,066 --> 00:17:20,126
And the all-new extra-large

351
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:21,876
does anyone want to guess?

352
00:17:23,026 --> 00:17:23,496
That's right.

353
00:17:24,165 --> 00:17:27,445
Extra-large watch face uses the

354
00:17:27,576 --> 00:17:29,726
You guys are quick.

355
00:17:29,726 --> 00:17:30,976
Now I hope you wrote

356
00:17:30,976 --> 00:17:32,796
because that information

357
00:17:33,896 --> 00:17:34,806
No, I'm just kidding.

358
00:17:35,026 --> 00:17:37,206
All of that information

359
00:17:37,206 --> 00:17:39,976
in the watchOS Human

360
00:17:40,396 --> 00:17:43,866
This is your go-to place

361
00:17:43,866 --> 00:17:45,096
to the design of your watch app.

362
00:17:45,096 --> 00:17:47,106
I highly recommend

363
00:17:48,256 --> 00:17:50,476
Now it's important that

364
00:17:50,866 --> 00:17:52,526
for every complication family

365
00:17:52,886 --> 00:17:55,376
so that people can

366
00:17:55,376 --> 00:17:57,696
on the watch face

367
00:17:58,416 --> 00:18:00,586
And be sure to use

368
00:17:58,416 --> 00:18:00,586
And be sure to use

369
00:18:00,586 --> 00:18:03,196
for your complication

370
00:18:03,196 --> 00:18:04,576
of what people will see

371
00:18:04,966 --> 00:18:07,046
when they actually

372
00:18:07,516 --> 00:18:09,796
Without placeholder data,

373
00:18:09,796 --> 00:18:13,446
for people to anticipate what

374
00:18:14,806 --> 00:18:15,806
All right.

375
00:18:15,806 --> 00:18:18,746
As you can see, some

376
00:18:18,816 --> 00:18:20,386
for more detailed information.

377
00:18:21,176 --> 00:18:22,436
On the modular watch face,

378
00:18:22,856 --> 00:18:25,506
if someone has made your

379
00:18:25,836 --> 00:18:29,036
they certainly care a lot about

380
00:18:30,096 --> 00:18:31,366
Take this as an opportunity

381
00:18:32,146 --> 00:18:34,096
to provide slightly

382
00:18:34,506 --> 00:18:35,846
that they might find helpful.

383
00:18:36,726 --> 00:18:40,366
In fact, you may want to display

384
00:18:40,726 --> 00:18:42,296
based on the complication

385
00:18:43,076 --> 00:18:45,486
If weather information is

386
00:18:46,246 --> 00:18:49,226
there's no reason why you

387
00:18:49,446 --> 00:18:52,386
of the CARROT Weather

388
00:18:53,536 --> 00:18:56,546
Maybe you'd use modular large

389
00:18:56,626 --> 00:19:00,696
and condition, and modular small

390
00:18:56,626 --> 00:19:00,696
and condition, and modular small

391
00:19:01,576 --> 00:19:04,136
Now even if you can't quite

392
00:19:04,486 --> 00:19:05,996
to show in your complication,

393
00:19:06,576 --> 00:19:08,966
you can always just

394
00:19:09,776 --> 00:19:12,756
The complication for Just

395
00:19:13,086 --> 00:19:16,346
for recording voice memos,

396
00:19:16,996 --> 00:19:18,986
Tapping it launches

397
00:19:19,286 --> 00:19:21,356
but it also begins

398
00:19:21,816 --> 00:19:24,146
It's super convenient and fast.

399
00:19:24,856 --> 00:19:30,286
So if it's not already clear, we

400
00:19:31,026 --> 00:19:33,256
And we think that

401
00:19:33,606 --> 00:19:35,326
the more Apple Watch

402
00:19:35,326 --> 00:19:37,306
about how useful

403
00:19:37,716 --> 00:19:40,036
the more complications

404
00:19:41,026 --> 00:19:44,346
Now to make it easier to access

405
00:19:44,796 --> 00:19:49,146
people can now easily switch

406
00:19:49,826 --> 00:19:52,586
With a simple swipe, you can go

407
00:19:52,936 --> 00:19:56,136
to the workout watch face, and

408
00:19:56,526 --> 00:19:57,796
to the weekend watch face.

409
00:19:58,556 --> 00:20:01,196
Now think about all of

410
00:19:58,556 --> 00:20:01,196
Now think about all of

411
00:20:01,196 --> 00:20:02,766
that we do with our time.

412
00:20:03,286 --> 00:20:05,126
Right? The variety

413
00:20:06,126 --> 00:20:07,646
No, seriously.

414
00:20:07,646 --> 00:20:11,126
We workout, we hangout,

415
00:20:11,426 --> 00:20:14,356
we play sports and do countless

416
00:20:15,056 --> 00:20:17,716
Now, it'll be easier

417
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:21,056
and complications installed to

418
00:20:21,556 --> 00:20:24,416
And this should lead to

419
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:26,646
of complications on Apple Watch.

420
00:20:27,346 --> 00:20:29,956
Make one of those

421
00:20:30,006 --> 00:20:34,066
All right, so that

422
00:20:34,936 --> 00:20:38,556
Now, let's move on to best

423
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:45,196
Notifications should

424
00:20:46,066 --> 00:20:48,116
and they should be

425
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:52,436
to communicate information

426
00:20:53,186 --> 00:20:56,466
In other words, they

427
00:20:57,496 --> 00:21:00,396
Keep in mind that the person

428
00:20:57,496 --> 00:21:00,396
Keep in mind that the person

429
00:21:00,636 --> 00:21:03,696
could be anywhere and

430
00:21:04,566 --> 00:21:07,006
They could be at dinner,

431
00:21:07,876 --> 00:21:10,456
riding on the subway,

432
00:21:11,286 --> 00:21:14,776
or in a meeting discussing

433
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:18,776
Now, in so many situations,

434
00:21:19,066 --> 00:21:21,886
in the task at hand or just

435
00:21:21,886 --> 00:21:22,916
to the world around them.

436
00:21:23,516 --> 00:21:25,386
So your notifications need

437
00:21:25,386 --> 00:21:28,116
to communicate clearly

438
00:21:29,126 --> 00:21:32,366
Luckily, making your

439
00:21:32,366 --> 00:21:32,966
so difficult.

440
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:35,996
First, you just need to

441
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:38,466
Now notifications

442
00:21:38,466 --> 00:21:39,806
ashort look and a long look.

443
00:21:40,376 --> 00:21:42,396
And as the name implies,

444
00:21:42,396 --> 00:21:44,276
to give you a sense of

445
00:21:44,276 --> 00:21:45,406
about really quickly.

446
00:21:46,036 --> 00:21:48,656
And the title that you provide

447
00:21:49,236 --> 00:21:51,666
Now, in some cases, that title

448
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:53,506
need to know about

449
00:21:54,596 --> 00:21:57,626
Second, only show

450
00:21:58,146 --> 00:21:59,626
I can't stress this enough.

451
00:22:00,126 --> 00:22:02,196
The more you show

452
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:04,426
the harder it's going to

453
00:22:04,426 --> 00:22:05,816
on what's most important.

454
00:22:06,526 --> 00:22:09,476
So let's say you're making

455
00:22:09,876 --> 00:22:11,396
for a travel app.

456
00:22:11,506 --> 00:22:13,376
The notification might

457
00:22:13,376 --> 00:22:15,136
of potentially useful

458
00:22:15,486 --> 00:22:16,686
about the traveler's flight.

459
00:22:17,446 --> 00:22:21,826
But seeing things like the

460
00:22:21,826 --> 00:22:25,236
in a notification when it's

461
00:22:25,236 --> 00:22:27,976
that important, so

462
00:22:27,976 --> 00:22:29,686
that information altogether.

463
00:22:31,036 --> 00:22:34,546
Third, present important

464
00:22:34,896 --> 00:22:37,056
By putting the most

465
00:22:37,486 --> 00:22:39,916
people are more likely to

466
00:22:39,916 --> 00:22:41,206
without the need to scroll.

467
00:22:41,746 --> 00:22:44,346
And this is really helpful if

468
00:22:44,606 --> 00:22:46,986
and they might not be able

469
00:22:47,446 --> 00:22:48,976
or access the Digital Crown.

470
00:22:50,046 --> 00:22:51,766
So for our check-in

471
00:22:52,246 --> 00:22:54,466
we might move content

472
00:22:54,466 --> 00:22:56,406
and boarding time a

473
00:22:56,406 --> 00:22:57,836
down in the notification.

474
00:22:59,056 --> 00:23:02,506
Fourth, vary the size

475
00:22:59,056 --> 00:23:02,506
Fourth, vary the size

476
00:23:02,936 --> 00:23:05,426
to establish a clear

477
00:23:06,136 --> 00:23:08,606
Your notification should

478
00:23:08,606 --> 00:23:11,046
on the most important

479
00:23:11,746 --> 00:23:15,796
This notification has all the

480
00:23:15,796 --> 00:23:18,396
in the right order, but

481
00:23:18,396 --> 00:23:20,276
with equivalent visual weight.

482
00:23:21,086 --> 00:23:24,046
Apple Watch notifications

483
00:23:24,386 --> 00:23:27,476
You have full control over

484
00:23:27,476 --> 00:23:29,276
background and sash color.

485
00:23:30,416 --> 00:23:33,226
Use this capability to

486
00:23:33,226 --> 00:23:34,966
out what's most important.

487
00:23:35,756 --> 00:23:38,496
Now this design really

488
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:42,346
like ticket class, seat number,

489
00:23:42,386 --> 00:23:45,096
And the purpose of this

490
00:23:45,096 --> 00:23:47,756
for you to check in

491
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:49,876
And lastly,

492
00:23:50,336 --> 00:23:53,566
thoughtfully-designed

493
00:23:53,566 --> 00:23:54,826
graphics, and animations

494
00:23:54,826 --> 00:23:57,336
to convey meaning

495
00:23:58,306 --> 00:24:01,416
Visuals can sometimes

496
00:23:58,306 --> 00:24:01,416
Visuals can sometimes

497
00:24:01,736 --> 00:24:03,786
and more clearly than text.

498
00:24:04,726 --> 00:24:08,236
Icons can help save space

499
00:24:08,236 --> 00:24:10,466
to display everything

500
00:24:11,076 --> 00:24:14,946
But be mindful that some

501
00:24:14,946 --> 00:24:17,286
understood or could

502
00:24:17,616 --> 00:24:20,376
So you want to look for icons

503
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:23,786
across regions and cultures,

504
00:24:23,886 --> 00:24:27,276
to be clear to the

505
00:24:27,276 --> 00:24:29,926
And short, meaningful

506
00:24:30,246 --> 00:24:33,516
to complement text and to

507
00:24:34,386 --> 00:24:38,186
And graphs and other data

508
00:24:38,186 --> 00:24:41,306
for a more interesting visual

509
00:24:41,306 --> 00:24:43,586
in far more meaning

510
00:24:44,746 --> 00:24:48,346
But there's more to consider

511
00:24:48,506 --> 00:24:50,026
of your notifications.

512
00:24:52,136 --> 00:24:55,026
You also need to think

513
00:24:55,446 --> 00:24:56,876
and when you're sending them.

514
00:24:57,766 --> 00:24:58,726
Getting a notification

515
00:24:58,726 --> 00:25:03,066
at the wrong time can be just

516
00:24:58,726 --> 00:25:03,066
at the wrong time can be just

517
00:25:03,726 --> 00:25:06,356
If you got a notification

518
00:25:06,426 --> 00:25:10,036
so annoyed unless it was about

519
00:25:10,036 --> 00:25:11,086
than being here right now,

520
00:25:11,576 --> 00:25:13,296
which is completely

521
00:25:15,576 --> 00:25:18,466
Now, because Apple Watch

522
00:25:18,466 --> 00:25:21,196
on their wrist when they

523
00:25:21,516 --> 00:25:23,526
notifications are

524
00:25:24,026 --> 00:25:26,266
If your app sends

525
00:25:26,266 --> 00:25:29,886
that are not genuinely useful,

526
00:25:30,246 --> 00:25:32,846
people are likely to just

527
00:25:33,056 --> 00:25:34,876
to send notifications

528
00:25:36,226 --> 00:25:41,846
So, how do you know why and

529
00:25:42,966 --> 00:25:46,456
Well, the best approach is to

530
00:25:46,656 --> 00:25:48,486
to the people who use your app

531
00:25:48,486 --> 00:25:50,686
and intelligently

532
00:25:51,006 --> 00:25:52,456
for when they're

533
00:25:53,316 --> 00:25:56,546
Now I have two really

534
00:25:56,546 --> 00:25:59,006
I have two really

535
00:25:59,486 --> 00:26:02,556
The first is from the

536
00:25:59,486 --> 00:26:02,556
The first is from the

537
00:26:03,596 --> 00:26:05,006
Dark Sky notifies people

538
00:26:05,006 --> 00:26:07,606
about significant

539
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:09,976
such as when it's

540
00:26:10,286 --> 00:26:12,026
or when rain is about to stop.

541
00:26:13,096 --> 00:26:15,946
Now, in the case of Dark

542
00:26:15,946 --> 00:26:17,306
by contextual factors.

543
00:26:17,686 --> 00:26:21,856
Notifications are sent based on

544
00:26:21,856 --> 00:26:24,516
to an approaching or

545
00:26:25,366 --> 00:26:28,416
And notifications are sent early

546
00:26:28,416 --> 00:26:31,486
to get the umbrella out

547
00:26:31,486 --> 00:26:32,896
down raining cats and dogs.

548
00:26:33,726 --> 00:26:36,386
Now, because these notifications

549
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:39,256
and timely, they

550
00:26:40,106 --> 00:26:43,356
Knowing that it's about to

551
00:26:43,466 --> 00:26:44,816
to get ready to go for a run.

552
00:26:45,496 --> 00:26:49,536
Knowing that it's about to

553
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:51,566
to walk to my couch

554
00:26:52,686 --> 00:26:56,226
Now, in addition to contextual

555
00:26:56,226 --> 00:26:58,586
and patterns can provide

556
00:26:58,956 --> 00:27:00,476
into what people want to know

557
00:26:58,956 --> 00:27:00,476
into what people want to know

558
00:27:00,476 --> 00:27:02,006
and when they want

559
00:27:02,646 --> 00:27:05,466
Now, to explain, let's

560
00:27:06,616 --> 00:27:11,856
Streaks is an app that helps

561
00:27:12,266 --> 00:27:14,206
and also just won an

562
00:27:15,136 --> 00:27:18,036
People can pick up to

563
00:27:18,036 --> 00:27:19,496
to do on a daily basis.

564
00:27:20,046 --> 00:27:22,346
Now, as the name suggests,

565
00:27:22,346 --> 00:27:23,876
on streaks of daily tasks

566
00:27:24,166 --> 00:27:26,556
because doing something

567
00:27:26,656 --> 00:27:27,766
to become a routine.

568
00:27:28,606 --> 00:27:30,676
So, if you want to

569
00:27:30,676 --> 00:27:33,326
of doing core-strengthening

570
00:27:33,826 --> 00:27:37,286
Which I should be doing or

571
00:27:37,796 --> 00:27:40,536
or remembering to refill your

572
00:27:40,536 --> 00:27:44,906
for a walk, Streaks is going

573
00:27:45,356 --> 00:27:48,136
My dogs have never been

574
00:27:48,376 --> 00:27:51,586
They don't realize it, but

575
00:27:52,546 --> 00:27:55,126
Of course, the whole point

576
00:27:55,126 --> 00:27:57,836
that people want to

577
00:27:57,836 --> 00:28:01,216
but just can't seem

578
00:27:57,836 --> 00:28:01,216
but just can't seem

579
00:28:01,366 --> 00:28:04,696
So Streaks uses notifications

580
00:28:05,496 --> 00:28:08,116
But these reminders are

581
00:28:08,116 --> 00:28:09,646
at just the right time.

582
00:28:10,206 --> 00:28:12,966
They should arrive close to

583
00:28:12,966 --> 00:28:14,066
to take action.

584
00:28:15,256 --> 00:28:18,596
Or, put another way, when

585
00:28:18,946 --> 00:28:23,656
But how does Streaks

586
00:28:23,846 --> 00:28:25,766
Well, at first, they don't.

587
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:29,756
To explain what it does, let's

588
00:28:30,556 --> 00:28:33,056
Now I'm trying to get into

589
00:28:33,796 --> 00:28:36,576
And at a somewhat randomized

590
00:28:36,916 --> 00:28:38,676
I'll get a reminder

591
00:28:39,506 --> 00:28:42,426
It doesn't arrive so late

592
00:28:42,466 --> 00:28:44,796
to play guitar or that

593
00:28:45,646 --> 00:28:49,086
But it's not so early that

594
00:28:50,476 --> 00:28:51,576
So, for simplicity's sake,

595
00:28:52,386 --> 00:28:54,856
let's say I get the

596
00:28:55,566 --> 00:28:56,686
Now, that's a bit early.

597
00:28:56,806 --> 00:29:00,386
So I can tap a 30-minute

598
00:28:56,806 --> 00:29:00,386
So I can tap a 30-minute

599
00:29:00,386 --> 00:29:02,246
and delaying that notification

600
00:29:02,246 --> 00:29:04,296
until I'm finally

601
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:08,076
And when I play guitar,

602
00:29:08,076 --> 00:29:12,036
as complete in the app.

603
00:29:12,146 --> 00:29:13,506
Streaks takes note of this time.

604
00:29:14,306 --> 00:29:17,616
Day after day, each time I

605
00:29:17,826 --> 00:29:20,766
Streaks gets an increasingly

606
00:29:20,766 --> 00:29:22,926
of when I typically play guitar.

607
00:29:23,916 --> 00:29:26,806
Streaks uses that time

608
00:29:27,136 --> 00:29:30,206
to automatically arrive

609
00:29:30,766 --> 00:29:33,656
It's such a simple

610
00:29:34,906 --> 00:29:37,646
The actual timing

611
00:29:38,006 --> 00:29:41,056
because obviously I can't just

612
00:29:41,056 --> 00:29:42,596
of a hat and start

613
00:29:43,546 --> 00:29:46,076
However, automatically

614
00:29:46,076 --> 00:29:48,836
and notifications might not

615
00:29:49,526 --> 00:29:53,136
Some tasks you want to do

616
00:29:53,286 --> 00:29:55,706
and Streaks gives you

617
00:29:56,556 --> 00:29:58,776
Or maybe you don't want

618
00:29:58,776 --> 00:30:00,976
you just want one

619
00:29:58,776 --> 00:30:00,976
you just want one

620
00:30:01,346 --> 00:30:03,096
So Streaks gives

621
00:30:03,726 --> 00:30:07,106
And you can disable

622
00:30:07,966 --> 00:30:09,636
or turn off notifications

623
00:30:10,456 --> 00:30:13,156
So by smartly choosing when

624
00:30:14,026 --> 00:30:17,536
and giving users full

625
00:30:17,536 --> 00:30:19,966
like to be notified,

626
00:30:19,966 --> 00:30:23,156
that Streaks sends are less

627
00:30:24,076 --> 00:30:25,686
ignored, and unwelcome.

628
00:30:27,156 --> 00:30:28,116
Now the notifications

629
00:30:28,116 --> 00:30:31,056
that Streaks sends

630
00:30:31,056 --> 00:30:33,396
as they remind people to

631
00:30:33,396 --> 00:30:34,206
physical task.

632
00:30:34,786 --> 00:30:37,866
But making notifications

633
00:30:37,866 --> 00:30:40,796
literally adding actions

634
00:30:41,366 --> 00:30:44,266
Now I encourage you to explore

635
00:30:44,266 --> 00:30:46,096
that you send actionable.

636
00:30:47,076 --> 00:30:48,736
Being able to quickly triage

637
00:30:48,736 --> 00:30:51,296
from your wrist is a

638
00:30:51,956 --> 00:30:54,526
Notifications can push

639
00:30:54,696 --> 00:30:58,526
who use your app, and they're

640
00:30:58,526 --> 00:31:00,686
of engagement to people

641
00:30:58,526 --> 00:31:00,686
of engagement to people

642
00:31:00,686 --> 00:31:01,036
of their day.

643
00:31:02,526 --> 00:31:05,876
Now you can have up to four

644
00:31:06,306 --> 00:31:08,856
And be sure to only show

645
00:31:08,856 --> 00:31:10,526
to the content of

646
00:31:11,886 --> 00:31:15,706
Make sure that actions are

647
00:31:15,916 --> 00:31:17,796
and use action-oriented verbs.

648
00:31:18,516 --> 00:31:20,936
And try to focus on actions

649
00:31:20,936 --> 00:31:24,106
in one tap just one

650
00:31:24,586 --> 00:31:26,336
However, sometimes one

651
00:31:26,336 --> 00:31:28,596
or two additional steps

652
00:31:29,176 --> 00:31:32,256
Now multi-step flows will

653
00:31:32,256 --> 00:31:34,166
and that used to be

654
00:31:34,166 --> 00:31:36,596
because apps would take a

655
00:31:37,436 --> 00:31:40,856
But in watchOS 3, when your

656
00:31:41,096 --> 00:31:42,936
your app will be launched

657
00:31:43,396 --> 00:31:45,456
This gives you an opportunity

658
00:31:45,456 --> 00:31:49,676
to make sure your app's data is

659
00:31:49,676 --> 00:31:50,736
for people to show up.

660
00:31:51,466 --> 00:31:53,696
So don't shy away from

661
00:31:53,896 --> 00:31:55,156
if that's what's necessary.

662
00:31:55,946 --> 00:31:59,046
Now, speaking of taking

663
00:31:59,686 --> 00:32:03,376
it's time to talk about apps.

664
00:31:59,686 --> 00:32:03,376
it's time to talk about apps.

665
00:32:03,616 --> 00:32:07,336
watchOS 3 will profoundly

666
00:32:07,336 --> 00:32:08,656
and interact with apps.

667
00:32:09,266 --> 00:32:11,486
Let's take a look at the

668
00:32:11,796 --> 00:32:13,346
and what they'll mean to you.

669
00:32:14,446 --> 00:32:15,466
Let's start with the new Dock.

670
00:32:16,666 --> 00:32:19,986
People can put up to 10 of their

671
00:32:20,496 --> 00:32:24,086
and every app in the Dock is

672
00:32:24,146 --> 00:32:28,856
from the Dock into an app fast.

673
00:32:29,786 --> 00:32:32,606
And what's shown are

674
00:32:33,386 --> 00:32:35,206
These snapshots should

675
00:32:35,206 --> 00:32:37,196
to be informative

676
00:32:37,786 --> 00:32:41,026
And snapshots from your app

677
00:32:41,316 --> 00:32:42,346
to keep them current.

678
00:32:43,456 --> 00:32:45,626
Apps in the Dock are

679
00:32:45,626 --> 00:32:46,716
at least once an hour.

680
00:32:47,156 --> 00:32:49,786
This lets you fetch new

681
00:32:49,876 --> 00:32:52,356
and request that the

682
00:32:52,686 --> 00:32:54,906
of your app if it's necessary.

683
00:32:55,976 --> 00:32:59,656
And when your app is viewed in

684
00:32:59,656 --> 00:33:03,126
that it can update its

685
00:32:59,656 --> 00:33:03,126
that it can update its

686
00:33:04,216 --> 00:33:06,736
Now when someone puts

687
00:33:07,216 --> 00:33:08,236
you should be flattered.

688
00:33:08,896 --> 00:33:12,486
Being in the Dock means that

689
00:33:12,486 --> 00:33:14,916
that people want to be

690
00:33:15,796 --> 00:33:18,186
Because of this, it's

691
00:33:18,186 --> 00:33:21,816
of your app are not only

692
00:33:22,816 --> 00:33:26,056
Now, in some situations,

693
00:33:26,056 --> 00:33:29,436
that they saw when they were

694
00:33:29,556 --> 00:33:30,276
that relevant.

695
00:33:31,046 --> 00:33:35,036
Fortunately, watchOS 3 provides

696
00:33:35,036 --> 00:33:37,156
to a different screen

697
00:33:37,156 --> 00:33:38,326
that they were last looking at.

698
00:33:39,066 --> 00:33:42,336
So, for instance,

699
00:33:42,336 --> 00:33:45,496
that shows a list view of

700
00:33:45,886 --> 00:33:48,996
And of course, each of these

701
00:33:48,996 --> 00:33:51,396
to a detail screen

702
00:33:52,226 --> 00:33:56,716
Okay. Now, imagine yourself

703
00:33:57,526 --> 00:33:59,446
The last time you were in

704
00:33:59,446 --> 00:34:00,616
at this particular game.

705
00:33:59,446 --> 00:34:00,616
at this particular game.

706
00:34:01,196 --> 00:34:04,226
And when you exit out and

707
00:34:04,916 --> 00:34:06,616
you probably expect to continue

708
00:34:06,616 --> 00:34:08,476
to see the details

709
00:34:09,216 --> 00:34:11,735
And when the game

710
00:34:12,376 --> 00:34:15,356
You probably still expect to see

711
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:17,376
But after a little while,

712
00:34:17,636 --> 00:34:20,036
the details about this

713
00:34:20,565 --> 00:34:21,766
and less relevant.

714
00:34:22,306 --> 00:34:24,085
You may have learned

715
00:34:24,116 --> 00:34:26,755
from a notification the app

716
00:34:27,246 --> 00:34:28,616
on Twitter, in the news.

717
00:34:29,576 --> 00:34:33,896
At some point, the content here

718
00:34:34,166 --> 00:34:36,226
You're not interested

719
00:34:36,226 --> 00:34:38,525
Perhaps you're going

720
00:34:38,525 --> 00:34:40,446
in seeing the next

721
00:34:41,056 --> 00:34:44,286
Or if your favorite team is

722
00:34:44,286 --> 00:34:46,266
already started,

723
00:34:46,266 --> 00:34:48,255
to see the details

724
00:34:49,156 --> 00:34:51,386
Now these are the sorts

725
00:34:51,386 --> 00:34:53,516
to be asking about your app.

726
00:34:54,056 --> 00:34:55,335
And as you do so, I want you

727
00:34:55,335 --> 00:34:57,876
to consider the following

728
00:34:59,296 --> 00:35:01,786
First and foremost,

729
00:34:59,296 --> 00:35:01,786
First and foremost,

730
00:35:01,786 --> 00:35:04,876
to proactively anticipate

731
00:35:05,846 --> 00:35:08,896
Put yourself in their

732
00:35:09,946 --> 00:35:13,446
Graphing events onto a timeline

733
00:35:13,806 --> 00:35:14,546
for doing this.

734
00:35:15,316 --> 00:35:18,556
Plot out significant events

735
00:35:19,056 --> 00:35:22,196
"How do these events influence

736
00:35:23,086 --> 00:35:25,886
In the hypothetical baseball

737
00:35:25,886 --> 00:35:30,176
I speculated that people will

738
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:32,346
or during the times where

739
00:35:33,306 --> 00:35:36,106
While, at other times, those

740
00:35:36,106 --> 00:35:37,896
about the overall

741
00:35:38,836 --> 00:35:42,736
However, this is probably

742
00:35:43,446 --> 00:35:45,936
Individual preferences

743
00:35:45,936 --> 00:35:47,636
on what's most relevant

744
00:35:48,386 --> 00:35:51,576
For instance, a fair-weather

745
00:35:51,576 --> 00:35:55,066
about one team might expect to

746
00:35:55,066 --> 00:35:58,466
than a hardcore baseball fanatic

747
00:35:59,056 --> 00:36:01,816
And for other apps, other

748
00:35:59,056 --> 00:36:01,816
And for other apps, other

749
00:36:01,816 --> 00:36:04,456
of day and location

750
00:36:04,786 --> 00:36:06,136
on what people want to see.

751
00:36:07,216 --> 00:36:10,266
Now, as a general rule,

752
00:36:10,266 --> 00:36:12,596
when an app changes

753
00:36:12,596 --> 00:36:13,966
and the state isn't saved.

754
00:36:14,066 --> 00:36:16,586
And it can be confusing

755
00:36:17,076 --> 00:36:19,396
So if you choose to navigate

756
00:36:19,396 --> 00:36:22,296
you want to do so in a way

757
00:36:22,996 --> 00:36:25,296
The hope is that

758
00:36:25,296 --> 00:36:26,646
to realize what's going on.

759
00:36:27,056 --> 00:36:28,386
But if they do, they

760
00:36:28,386 --> 00:36:31,276
to make some really accurate

761
00:36:31,276 --> 00:36:34,166
of your app's UI changes

762
00:36:35,186 --> 00:36:36,476
And I would also recommend

763
00:36:36,476 --> 00:36:39,626
against making the snapshot

764
00:36:39,996 --> 00:36:41,036
from your app.

765
00:36:41,606 --> 00:36:43,976
This can make your app a

766
00:36:43,976 --> 00:36:45,106
and may be harder to find.

767
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:49,376
Now it's totally fine to just

768
00:36:49,686 --> 00:36:52,016
or maybe hide some stuff

769
00:36:52,016 --> 00:36:53,246
when your app is

770
00:36:53,696 --> 00:36:55,656
But, you know, if you want

771
00:36:55,656 --> 00:36:58,226
of certain things for

772
00:36:58,766 --> 00:37:01,066
But don't make it look

773
00:36:58,766 --> 00:37:01,066
But don't make it look

774
00:37:02,186 --> 00:37:04,706
Now next, avoid showing

775
00:37:04,706 --> 00:37:08,186
or confirmation dialogues, or

776
00:37:09,036 --> 00:37:10,156
When seen out of context,

777
00:37:10,506 --> 00:37:12,836
these sorts of screens

778
00:37:12,836 --> 00:37:15,416
And in fact, they might

779
00:37:15,416 --> 00:37:16,606
or make no sense at all.

780
00:37:17,216 --> 00:37:18,376
So, depending on the situation,

781
00:37:18,376 --> 00:37:20,836
consider programmatically

782
00:37:21,166 --> 00:37:23,176
after some period of time.

783
00:37:23,466 --> 00:37:27,446
And lastly, optimize your app

784
00:37:27,446 --> 00:37:28,766
in a miniaturized form.

785
00:37:29,576 --> 00:37:32,716
Now, in the Dock, apps

786
00:37:32,716 --> 00:37:34,476
and this is, like, just

787
00:37:34,476 --> 00:37:39,946
but 62.4851% of their

788
00:37:39,946 --> 00:37:42,066
You'll want to avoid

789
00:37:42,066 --> 00:37:44,466
from becoming illegible

790
00:37:45,076 --> 00:37:47,666
Now for this very reason, the

791
00:37:47,666 --> 00:37:50,366
and a lot of text in the

792
00:37:50,366 --> 00:37:51,836
from regular to medium.

793
00:37:52,466 --> 00:37:55,276
At smaller sizes, bolder

794
00:37:56,336 --> 00:38:00,686
And for really key information,

795
00:37:56,336 --> 00:38:00,686
And for really key information,

796
00:38:01,306 --> 00:38:04,036
This may require removing some

797
00:38:04,036 --> 00:38:07,376
to make space, but that's not

798
00:38:08,556 --> 00:38:11,616
Now, by following these

799
00:38:11,616 --> 00:38:13,786
as glanceable as

800
00:38:14,996 --> 00:38:16,226
And speaking of glanceable,

801
00:38:16,806 --> 00:38:18,966
some of you may be

802
00:38:20,336 --> 00:38:24,026
Glances were designed to be a

803
00:38:24,026 --> 00:38:25,826
and contextually-relevant

804
00:38:25,826 --> 00:38:27,216
from the user's favorite apps.

805
00:38:27,886 --> 00:38:30,776
Not coincidentally, the Dock

806
00:38:30,776 --> 00:38:34,856
purpose while simplifying the

807
00:38:35,706 --> 00:38:38,266
In a way, Glances

808
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:41,756
And the Dock, in turn, made

809
00:38:42,236 --> 00:38:44,096
So they were removed

810
00:38:44,836 --> 00:38:47,626
With that said, the time and

811
00:38:47,626 --> 00:38:52,776
into designing your Glances is

812
00:38:52,776 --> 00:38:55,986
about how to design your app

813
00:38:57,516 --> 00:39:04,456
Okay. So, the next big change

814
00:38:57,516 --> 00:39:04,456
Okay. So, the next big change

815
00:39:04,456 --> 00:39:08,766
but powerful improvement to how

816
00:39:10,266 --> 00:39:13,546
Most existing Apple Watch apps

817
00:39:14,006 --> 00:39:17,236
Basically, a top-level list

818
00:39:17,626 --> 00:39:19,736
Now that's not so

819
00:39:19,736 --> 00:39:21,536
to organize data hierarchically.

820
00:39:22,196 --> 00:39:23,566
Unfortunately, navigating

821
00:39:23,566 --> 00:39:26,346
between those screens can

822
00:39:26,396 --> 00:39:30,846
to return to that top-level

823
00:39:31,066 --> 00:39:33,746
So, for example, if I want

824
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:36,256
I select an item,

825
00:39:36,446 --> 00:39:38,626
select another item,

826
00:39:39,116 --> 00:39:40,136
So forth and so on.

827
00:39:40,866 --> 00:39:43,686
It's kind of like being in a

828
00:39:43,686 --> 00:39:45,176
to get to the room

829
00:39:45,176 --> 00:39:47,866
But in order to get there, you

830
00:39:48,076 --> 00:39:50,056
and then back down

831
00:39:50,606 --> 00:39:52,126
It'd be so much more efficient

832
00:39:52,126 --> 00:39:54,926
if there was just a

833
00:39:55,666 --> 00:39:58,806
So in watchOS 3, we now

834
00:39:59,246 --> 00:40:02,836
It's now possible to navigate

835
00:39:59,246 --> 00:40:02,836
It's now possible to navigate

836
00:40:02,836 --> 00:40:06,626
to another by swiping vertically

837
00:40:07,556 --> 00:40:10,576
Think of it like vertical paging

838
00:40:11,466 --> 00:40:14,326
Now if your app is already

839
00:40:14,716 --> 00:40:17,146
you should really consider

840
00:40:17,146 --> 00:40:19,376
But one thing to point out is

841
00:40:19,376 --> 00:40:21,006
that this behavior

842
00:40:21,316 --> 00:40:24,166
when the detail screens are

843
00:40:25,106 --> 00:40:26,736
So with the previous

844
00:40:26,736 --> 00:40:29,886
the 10-day forecast made

845
00:40:29,886 --> 00:40:33,076
It was accessed by scrolling

846
00:40:33,716 --> 00:40:36,436
In the new version of Weather,

847
00:40:36,436 --> 00:40:38,386
to a child view so that

848
00:40:38,386 --> 00:40:39,236
on screen at once.

849
00:40:40,096 --> 00:40:42,426
So if you want to opt into

850
00:40:42,426 --> 00:40:45,016
to refactor your design

851
00:40:45,016 --> 00:40:48,906
And for those of you

852
00:40:49,786 --> 00:40:53,006
now is a really good time

853
00:40:53,006 --> 00:40:54,326
or to consider doing so.

854
00:40:54,886 --> 00:40:57,506
Navigating with the Digital

855
00:40:57,756 --> 00:41:00,426
than swiping horizontally

856
00:40:57,756 --> 00:41:00,426
than swiping horizontally

857
00:41:00,996 --> 00:41:03,666
And page-based apps do

858
00:41:04,076 --> 00:41:06,196
Obviously, that's not

859
00:41:06,976 --> 00:41:09,456
And having a top-level

860
00:41:09,456 --> 00:41:11,876
of detail items can

861
00:41:12,566 --> 00:41:16,076
By moving from a page-based

862
00:41:16,456 --> 00:41:18,556
our Weather App can

863
00:41:18,556 --> 00:41:21,206
and low temperatures for

864
00:41:21,756 --> 00:41:22,826
This is very handy.

865
00:41:24,766 --> 00:41:27,976
Okay. Now, the third

866
00:41:28,026 --> 00:41:30,756
on watchOS 3 relates

867
00:41:31,416 --> 00:41:33,506
Now besides just being

868
00:41:33,976 --> 00:41:36,686
stickiness describes how

869
00:41:36,686 --> 00:41:37,506
in the foreground.

870
00:41:38,016 --> 00:41:41,676
On watchOS 3, apps can

871
00:41:41,976 --> 00:41:43,786
which is quite a bit

872
00:41:44,496 --> 00:41:46,156
So when someone is

873
00:41:46,456 --> 00:41:47,656
and then drops their wrist,

874
00:41:47,986 --> 00:41:49,976
your app will be the

875
00:41:49,976 --> 00:41:52,006
when they raise their

876
00:41:52,006 --> 00:41:54,026
as they do so within 8 minutes.

877
00:41:54,856 --> 00:41:56,736
In fact, with every

878
00:41:56,736 --> 00:41:59,176
that timer gets reset

879
00:42:00,056 --> 00:42:03,706
Now making apps stickier is

880
00:42:04,276 --> 00:42:07,826
Apple Watch apps are intended

881
00:42:08,086 --> 00:42:11,686
that can occur over many

882
00:42:12,236 --> 00:42:15,646
But during those periods, the

883
00:42:15,736 --> 00:42:17,396
for many minutes at a time.

884
00:42:18,246 --> 00:42:20,756
So, one example might

885
00:42:21,036 --> 00:42:24,666
When shopping, most of your

886
00:42:24,666 --> 00:42:26,696
reading labels, inspecting

887
00:42:27,036 --> 00:42:29,056
trying to avoid crashing

888
00:42:29,306 --> 00:42:30,036
and trying to look cool.

889
00:42:30,836 --> 00:42:33,366
There are so many activities

890
00:42:33,766 --> 00:42:35,626
They're what we might

891
00:42:35,626 --> 00:42:37,516
or session-based activities.

892
00:42:38,266 --> 00:42:42,806
Cooking dinner, playing sports,

893
00:42:43,366 --> 00:42:46,186
These things all take

894
00:42:46,466 --> 00:42:48,996
in which people will

895
00:42:49,386 --> 00:42:50,056
to stay on task.

896
00:42:51,196 --> 00:42:54,596
Stronger stickiness puts you

897
00:42:54,836 --> 00:42:57,956
where you left off, which

898
00:42:59,186 --> 00:43:02,926
Okay. Now, the fourth

899
00:42:59,186 --> 00:43:02,926
Okay. Now, the fourth

900
00:43:03,116 --> 00:43:05,066
for apps involves

901
00:43:05,066 --> 00:43:07,426
when it's okay to

902
00:43:08,416 --> 00:43:10,716
When people initiate

903
00:43:10,716 --> 00:43:13,156
they expect to get

904
00:43:13,986 --> 00:43:16,996
Did the task succeed

905
00:43:17,676 --> 00:43:21,536
Unfortunately, providing

906
00:43:21,816 --> 00:43:25,036
conformation of success or

907
00:43:25,786 --> 00:43:28,386
Slow networks, weak

908
00:43:28,386 --> 00:43:32,256
and long Bluetooth ranges might

909
00:43:35,956 --> 00:43:37,456
or remote delays.

910
00:43:38,156 --> 00:43:40,906
Apps that allow people to

911
00:43:41,156 --> 00:43:44,766
like garage doors or window

912
00:43:44,766 --> 00:43:46,336
to provide completion feedback

913
00:43:46,636 --> 00:43:49,846
until those devices have

914
00:43:50,746 --> 00:43:53,646
And some services

915
00:43:53,646 --> 00:43:57,096
or ride-ordering apps

916
00:43:57,096 --> 00:43:57,976
with other people.

917
00:43:58,456 --> 00:44:01,466
And as we all know, people

918
00:43:58,456 --> 00:44:01,466
And as we all know, people

919
00:44:01,466 --> 00:44:02,206
to you promptly.

920
00:44:03,466 --> 00:44:06,836
Now on an iPhone or a Mac,

921
00:44:07,156 --> 00:44:09,416
you would ordinarily

922
00:44:09,416 --> 00:44:12,256
with your app while

923
00:44:12,256 --> 00:44:13,476
that confirmation feedback.

924
00:44:14,396 --> 00:44:17,186
Progress indicators are a way

925
00:44:17,556 --> 00:44:19,536
They make people

926
00:44:20,156 --> 00:44:21,696
They basically say,

927
00:44:21,736 --> 00:44:23,436
I'll be right with you."

928
00:44:23,586 --> 00:44:26,476
But, however, it might

929
00:44:26,926 --> 00:44:29,426
All the while, the person

930
00:44:29,426 --> 00:44:30,126
wrist raised.

931
00:44:30,506 --> 00:44:32,146
Their shoulder starts

932
00:44:32,626 --> 00:44:34,606
Seconds start to

933
00:44:35,046 --> 00:44:36,656
It really starts to slow down.

934
00:44:37,536 --> 00:44:41,526
So, to avoid this

935
00:44:41,916 --> 00:44:45,426
you should use an NSURL

936
00:44:45,696 --> 00:44:47,416
to communicate with your server.

937
00:44:48,046 --> 00:44:49,286
This does two things.

938
00:44:49,896 --> 00:44:52,526
First, it helps to make sure

939
00:44:52,526 --> 00:44:55,196
to your server before

940
00:44:55,806 --> 00:44:57,996
And second, when

941
00:44:58,046 --> 00:45:00,976
Apple Watch will

942
00:44:58,046 --> 00:45:00,976
Apple Watch will

943
00:45:00,976 --> 00:45:04,156
And then, in turn, you can

944
00:45:04,466 --> 00:45:06,856
and do something like

945
00:45:07,156 --> 00:45:10,526
which is also new to watchOS

946
00:45:10,526 --> 00:45:12,416
to the person who's

947
00:45:12,726 --> 00:45:17,176
So, for example, say you're

948
00:45:17,216 --> 00:45:20,306
When someone places a

949
00:45:20,306 --> 00:45:22,636
to make sure that the

950
00:45:22,976 --> 00:45:25,526
and provide an estimated

951
00:45:26,256 --> 00:45:30,396
You wouldn't want people to keep

952
00:45:30,396 --> 00:45:31,246
these things out.

953
00:45:32,026 --> 00:45:35,726
Instead, it's way better to

954
00:45:35,726 --> 00:45:37,796
that their order has been

955
00:45:38,456 --> 00:45:40,986
You can also let people know,

956
00:45:41,336 --> 00:45:43,266
That once the restaurant

957
00:45:43,266 --> 00:45:45,406
and provides an estimated

958
00:45:45,846 --> 00:45:47,816
you'll send a final

959
00:45:47,816 --> 00:45:50,076
that the order has been

960
00:45:51,356 --> 00:45:54,826
Now, if you've done this

961
00:45:55,296 --> 00:45:59,746
to drop their wrist, trusting

962
00:46:00,066 --> 00:46:02,236
to complete the task that

963
00:46:02,956 --> 00:46:07,236
And if all goes well, you send

964
00:46:07,236 --> 00:46:09,616
to let them know that the

965
00:46:09,916 --> 00:46:10,906
and it is on its way.

966
00:46:11,976 --> 00:46:15,376
And if there's a problem,

967
00:46:15,376 --> 00:46:17,626
and help people address

968
00:46:17,846 --> 00:46:19,946
with minimal additional

969
00:46:20,746 --> 00:46:24,096
Now, the key to making

970
00:46:25,006 --> 00:46:28,976
People need to trust that your

971
00:46:29,326 --> 00:46:31,836
and that you'll make sure

972
00:46:31,836 --> 00:46:34,876
about whether the task

973
00:46:35,746 --> 00:46:38,826
And related to trust, you

974
00:46:38,826 --> 00:46:40,876
into thinking that a

975
00:46:41,246 --> 00:46:43,216
if it's actually

976
00:46:43,816 --> 00:46:47,426
That's basically lying, which

977
00:46:47,816 --> 00:46:52,296
Okay, so that was a lot

978
00:46:52,656 --> 00:46:55,366
And there's still a little bit

979
00:46:55,366 --> 00:46:57,346
to pause here for a

980
00:46:57,916 --> 00:47:02,666
We looked at the new Dock

981
00:46:57,916 --> 00:47:02,666
We looked at the new Dock

982
00:47:02,666 --> 00:47:04,916
as glanceable and

983
00:47:05,606 --> 00:47:07,586
We saw how the Digital

984
00:47:07,586 --> 00:47:08,856
between detail screens

985
00:47:09,156 --> 00:47:11,746
and hierarchical apps

986
00:47:12,396 --> 00:47:14,936
We learned how session-based

987
00:47:14,976 --> 00:47:16,696
from changes to app stickiness.

988
00:47:17,326 --> 00:47:19,096
And we just saw how the ability

989
00:47:19,096 --> 00:47:21,526
to schedule local notifications

990
00:47:21,526 --> 00:47:23,436
in the background

991
00:47:23,436 --> 00:47:26,416
who use your app the

992
00:47:26,746 --> 00:47:27,936
to keep interactions quick.

993
00:47:28,786 --> 00:47:30,526
Now we think that

994
00:47:30,526 --> 00:47:34,426
to watchOS will empower you to

995
00:47:34,866 --> 00:47:37,256
that shorten user

996
00:47:37,686 --> 00:47:41,666
Now, if the Apple Watch

997
00:47:42,046 --> 00:47:44,276
this would have been a

998
00:47:44,666 --> 00:47:46,936
I would have had plenty to

999
00:47:47,616 --> 00:47:48,746
But they did not stop there.

1000
00:47:49,066 --> 00:47:50,996
They're like a bunch

1001
00:47:51,066 --> 00:47:53,776
The kind of people who made me

1002
00:47:54,426 --> 00:47:57,646
In watchOS 3, there's

1003
00:47:57,646 --> 00:48:00,436
and frameworks to let you

1004
00:47:57,646 --> 00:48:00,436
and frameworks to let you

1005
00:48:01,056 --> 00:48:04,946
For starters, watchOS 3 now

1006
00:48:05,326 --> 00:48:07,676
our 2D and 3D graphics

1007
00:48:08,216 --> 00:48:11,686
SpriteKit and SceneKit let you

1008
00:48:12,476 --> 00:48:15,746
They let you make elements

1009
00:48:15,746 --> 00:48:18,286
or to animate things

1010
00:48:19,316 --> 00:48:21,296
And you can implement

1011
00:48:21,476 --> 00:48:22,626
I mean, it's crazy.

1012
00:48:22,986 --> 00:48:25,926
Force fields, detect

1013
00:48:26,736 --> 00:48:29,256
Now you might think about these

1014
00:48:29,256 --> 00:48:32,566
for games, but you can

1015
00:48:33,436 --> 00:48:36,296
And watchOS 3 has

1016
00:48:36,896 --> 00:48:40,116
Up until now, touch input

1017
00:48:40,576 --> 00:48:43,386
The controls and views that you

1018
00:48:43,386 --> 00:48:45,006
to touch events on your behalf.

1019
00:48:45,426 --> 00:48:48,306
Now, you have the ability to

1020
00:48:49,136 --> 00:48:52,866
So you can do something

1021
00:48:53,896 --> 00:48:57,306
or pan, or long press.

1022
00:48:58,326 --> 00:49:03,576
This one takes a

1023
00:48:58,326 --> 00:49:03,576
This one takes a

1024
00:49:03,746 --> 00:49:05,936
Okay, in watchOS 3,

1025
00:49:05,936 --> 00:49:07,596
to raw Digital Crown events.

1026
00:49:08,166 --> 00:49:11,286
You can use this data to

1027
00:49:11,286 --> 00:49:13,926
and other visual

1028
00:49:14,476 --> 00:49:16,216
Or, you can use the

1029
00:49:16,216 --> 00:49:18,776
for changing selection

1030
00:49:19,556 --> 00:49:22,926
So, what can you do with

1031
00:49:23,676 --> 00:49:25,786
Well, for starters,

1032
00:49:25,786 --> 00:49:28,656
to visualize data

1033
00:49:29,206 --> 00:49:30,896
With SpriteKit, you

1034
00:49:30,896 --> 00:49:33,556
like this programmatically so

1035
00:49:33,556 --> 00:49:36,126
between any two arbitrary

1036
00:49:37,116 --> 00:49:38,936
You can use the default

1037
00:49:38,936 --> 00:49:41,866
which provides a really

1038
00:49:42,926 --> 00:49:45,736
Or, you can do something

1039
00:49:45,736 --> 00:49:48,566
for a bouncy animation,

1040
00:49:48,566 --> 00:49:49,656
of animation that you'd like.

1041
00:49:50,296 --> 00:49:52,536
There's a ton of open

1042
00:49:52,536 --> 00:49:53,936
by the very generous people

1043
00:49:53,936 --> 00:49:55,396
in the SpriteKit

1044
00:49:55,396 --> 00:49:59,306
And you can even do things

1045
00:49:59,306 --> 00:50:01,626
of the rings to reflect

1046
00:49:59,306 --> 00:50:01,626
of the rings to reflect

1047
00:50:03,046 --> 00:50:06,386
Data visualization, like charts

1048
00:50:06,386 --> 00:50:07,686
to life with animation.

1049
00:50:08,366 --> 00:50:10,156
By drawing this chart

1050
00:50:10,436 --> 00:50:13,466
we can animate the built-in

1051
00:50:14,116 --> 00:50:16,796
or we can use animation

1052
00:50:16,796 --> 00:50:18,476
to a particular part

1053
00:50:19,336 --> 00:50:20,856
SpriteKit properties

1054
00:50:20,856 --> 00:50:23,066
so you can easily

1055
00:50:23,346 --> 00:50:25,926
to display different

1056
00:50:26,866 --> 00:50:27,966
Or, perhaps you want

1057
00:50:27,966 --> 00:50:31,126
to let people inspect

1058
00:50:31,186 --> 00:50:32,176
with a pan gesture.

1059
00:50:32,756 --> 00:50:35,596
Totally. Or, better still,

1060
00:50:35,596 --> 00:50:37,706
you can let people

1061
00:50:38,036 --> 00:50:39,066
to do the same thing.

1062
00:50:39,756 --> 00:50:42,386
Or, let people zoom

1063
00:50:42,996 --> 00:50:45,846
Or, maybe let people scroll.

1064
00:50:45,846 --> 00:50:50,236
And since you have full

1065
00:50:50,236 --> 00:50:52,646
and how the graph responds,

1066
00:50:52,646 --> 00:50:55,676
or slowly things happen

1067
00:50:56,456 --> 00:50:57,496
Now, I could go on.

1068
00:50:57,846 --> 00:51:00,166
This is a lot of fun to just

1069
00:50:57,846 --> 00:51:00,166
This is a lot of fun to just

1070
00:51:00,626 --> 00:51:02,856
but that would take all of

1071
00:51:03,756 --> 00:51:06,266
Now, I encourage you to

1072
00:51:06,266 --> 00:51:09,456
and SceneKit, and experiment

1073
00:51:09,766 --> 00:51:12,906
to create richer and more

1074
00:51:13,666 --> 00:51:15,066
But just remember,

1075
00:51:15,876 --> 00:51:18,846
with increased freedom comes

1076
00:51:19,906 --> 00:51:23,506
Animating something just because

1077
00:51:23,506 --> 00:51:24,146
good reason.

1078
00:51:24,806 --> 00:51:28,196
When used well, animation

1079
00:51:28,196 --> 00:51:31,366
quickly, and thereby

1080
00:51:32,066 --> 00:51:35,966
Similarly, making a graph

1081
00:51:36,016 --> 00:51:38,926
richer and more informative

1082
00:51:39,796 --> 00:51:43,816
and ideally reduce the need for

1083
00:51:45,696 --> 00:51:49,716
Okay. So, we've covered a lot

1084
00:51:49,716 --> 00:51:51,636
to leave you with

1085
00:51:51,946 --> 00:51:54,036
about designing your watch app.

1086
00:51:55,486 --> 00:51:59,696
Making a great Apple Watch

1087
00:51:59,786 --> 00:52:00,756
things simple.

1088
00:51:59,786 --> 00:52:00,756
things simple.

1089
00:52:01,736 --> 00:52:05,286
But making something simple

1090
00:52:06,106 --> 00:52:08,146
And bonus points if you

1091
00:52:09,266 --> 00:52:12,476
Keeping things simple

1092
00:52:12,766 --> 00:52:14,586
about what your app will do.

1093
00:52:15,246 --> 00:52:17,066
It means saying no to a lot

1094
00:52:17,066 --> 00:52:19,216
of really interesting-sounding

1095
00:52:20,016 --> 00:52:22,906
But just because you can

1096
00:52:22,906 --> 00:52:23,626
that you should.

1097
00:52:24,706 --> 00:52:28,286
Keeping things simple

1098
00:52:28,446 --> 00:52:31,276
about the journey that people

1099
00:52:31,276 --> 00:52:31,766
of their day.

1100
00:52:32,536 --> 00:52:35,046
People will experience

1101
00:52:35,516 --> 00:52:38,566
And the way that you design

1102
00:52:38,566 --> 00:52:39,056
of this.

1103
00:52:39,746 --> 00:52:42,906
Think less in terms of

1104
00:52:42,906 --> 00:52:44,526
in terms of user flows.

1105
00:52:45,436 --> 00:52:48,506
Account for the fact that

1106
00:52:48,916 --> 00:52:50,676
uninterrupted experiences.

1107
00:52:51,216 --> 00:52:54,506
People will drop in at arbitrary

1108
00:52:55,066 --> 00:52:58,996
And when they do, they'll always

1109
00:52:59,586 --> 00:53:02,296
and relevant to their

1110
00:52:59,586 --> 00:53:02,296
and relevant to their

1111
00:53:03,316 --> 00:53:06,076
Your app should anticipate

1112
00:53:06,076 --> 00:53:10,276
at any given moment, and attempt

1113
00:53:11,606 --> 00:53:14,416
and functionality that's

1114
00:53:14,536 --> 00:53:15,286
and timely.

1115
00:53:16,036 --> 00:53:18,696
Now doing that right

1116
00:53:20,116 --> 00:53:23,346
Designing for Apple Watch

1117
00:53:23,346 --> 00:53:27,766
for an iPhone, an

1118
00:53:28,986 --> 00:53:32,226
What we know about

1119
00:53:32,706 --> 00:53:35,346
for these devices has

1120
00:53:35,346 --> 00:53:40,046
about how complex apps should

1121
00:53:40,526 --> 00:53:44,176
and how much time they're

1122
00:53:45,096 --> 00:53:47,346
Try to recognize and

1123
00:53:47,346 --> 00:53:49,026
deeply-rooted assumptions.

1124
00:53:49,766 --> 00:53:51,496
This is easier said than done.

1125
00:53:51,636 --> 00:53:55,556
I know. But this is a crucial

1126
00:53:55,556 --> 00:53:57,676
great watch app.

1127
00:53:57,736 --> 00:54:00,766
Now, for Apple Watch,

1128
00:53:57,736 --> 00:54:00,766
Now, for Apple Watch,

1129
00:54:00,836 --> 00:54:03,466
that I can offer you

1130
00:54:03,466 --> 00:54:05,856
of features and not apps.

1131
00:54:06,726 --> 00:54:10,486
Making something great for Apple

1132
00:54:10,876 --> 00:54:12,296
one feature.

1133
00:54:13,236 --> 00:54:15,966
Just Press Record is

1134
00:54:16,296 --> 00:54:17,936
The complication is

1135
00:54:17,936 --> 00:54:21,236
and the app is the recording

1136
00:54:21,866 --> 00:54:22,816
It works great.

1137
00:54:23,296 --> 00:54:26,736
And I literally just described

1138
00:54:28,036 --> 00:54:30,846
Two seconds goes by in a flash.

1139
00:54:31,676 --> 00:54:33,786
There's nothing simple

1140
00:54:33,786 --> 00:54:35,646
for such brief interactions.

1141
00:54:36,246 --> 00:54:38,036
But I hope the concepts

1142
00:54:38,136 --> 00:54:41,936
that we discussed today will

1143
00:54:43,096 --> 00:54:46,236
And I'm really excited to

1144
00:54:46,236 --> 00:54:48,206
of the new capabilities

1145
00:54:48,816 --> 00:54:50,716
A lot of people worked

1146
00:54:51,016 --> 00:54:53,726
and all of that work was in

1147
00:54:53,726 --> 00:54:57,456
to build more innovative,

1148
00:54:57,456 --> 00:55:00,166
and platform-defining

1149
00:54:57,456 --> 00:55:00,166
and platform-defining

1150
00:55:01,246 --> 00:55:04,136
Okay. So for more information

1151
00:55:04,456 --> 00:55:05,716
please check out the video page

1152
00:55:05,716 --> 00:55:07,236
where there's a ton

1153
00:55:07,926 --> 00:55:09,736
Again, definitely go and check

1154
00:55:09,736 --> 00:55:11,916
out the watchOS Human

1155
00:55:12,276 --> 00:55:14,556
There's a ton of really

1156
00:55:14,716 --> 00:55:17,536
And we're going to continue

1157
00:55:17,536 --> 00:55:18,886
so check in regularly.

1158
00:55:19,436 --> 00:55:22,596
We also have a lot of great

1159
00:55:22,956 --> 00:55:24,426
I would definitely

1160
00:55:24,426 --> 00:55:27,126
out SpriteKit one and watching

1161
00:55:27,126 --> 00:55:29,336
that have already happened.

1162
00:55:29,336 --> 00:55:32,136
And this year, we had a lot of

1163
00:55:32,136 --> 00:55:33,136
Some of them are still to come.

1164
00:55:33,576 --> 00:55:36,386
I highly recommend Inclusive

1165
00:55:36,656 --> 00:55:40,486
to design for accessibility

1166
00:55:40,486 --> 00:55:41,666
for people around the world.

1167
00:55:41,796 --> 00:55:44,256
I also recommend the

1168
00:55:44,386 --> 00:55:46,076
about Typography and Fonts.

1169
00:55:46,076 --> 00:55:47,726
And there's one more

1170
00:55:48,016 --> 00:55:50,696
about Iterative UI Designs

1171
00:55:50,946 --> 00:55:53,626
and refine them and come up with

1172
00:55:53,816 --> 00:55:55,816
With that, thank you

1173
00:55:57,516 --> 00:56:01,500
