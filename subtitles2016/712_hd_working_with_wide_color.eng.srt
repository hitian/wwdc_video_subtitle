00:00:27,956 --> 00:00:28,776
&gt;&gt; Hello and welcome.

4
00:00:28,826 --> 00:00:31,536
I hope that everybody's

5
00:00:32,186 --> 00:00:34,216
My name is Justin Stoyles,

6
00:00:34,216 --> 00:00:35,286
and Media Group here at Apple.

7
00:00:35,806 --> 00:00:37,466
And I'm really excited

8
00:00:37,466 --> 00:00:38,746
about working with wide color.

9
00:00:39,476 --> 00:00:41,426
We're going to cover

10
00:00:41,536 --> 00:00:42,326
I'm going to start

11
00:00:42,326 --> 00:00:44,676
with discussing some

12
00:00:45,136 --> 00:00:47,146
And we'll talk a little bit

13
00:00:47,306 --> 00:00:48,086
and why does it matter.

14
00:00:48,996 --> 00:00:50,386
Then I'm going to hand

15
00:00:50,616 --> 00:00:53,206
who's going to walk you

16
00:00:53,206 --> 00:00:55,716
of getting wide color assets

17
00:00:56,066 --> 00:00:58,196
And then I'm going to

18
00:00:58,376 --> 00:01:00,136
who's going to talk about

19
00:00:58,376 --> 00:01:00,136
who's going to talk about

20
00:01:00,756 --> 00:01:01,496
So let's get started.

21
00:01:02,486 --> 00:01:04,396
As I mentioned, I'm

22
00:01:04,396 --> 00:01:06,546
about wide color today

23
00:01:06,546 --> 00:01:08,306
because we're actually

24
00:01:08,306 --> 00:01:10,826
that we handle wide color,

25
00:01:10,926 --> 00:01:12,326
on the Mac and iOS platform.

26
00:01:13,046 --> 00:01:15,936
A good place to start

27
00:01:16,466 --> 00:01:18,296
So Apple has always

28
00:01:18,296 --> 00:01:20,126
of solving the color

29
00:01:20,536 --> 00:01:22,146
And a good place to

30
00:01:22,346 --> 00:01:25,116
So ColorSync is our color

31
00:01:25,566 --> 00:01:27,436
and it was developed in

32
00:01:27,676 --> 00:01:30,146
Apple and a number of other

33
00:01:30,146 --> 00:01:32,866
together with the idea that

34
00:01:32,896 --> 00:01:35,166
and color reproduction

35
00:01:35,166 --> 00:01:37,296
of the problems faced by

36
00:01:37,616 --> 00:01:38,396
when working with color.

37
00:01:39,526 --> 00:01:40,806
That group later became known

38
00:01:40,806 --> 00:01:43,036
as the International

39
00:01:43,036 --> 00:01:44,116
which you may be familiar with.

40
00:01:44,856 --> 00:01:47,616
The work of ICC was then

41
00:01:47,616 --> 00:01:49,386
and we built that

42
00:01:51,106 --> 00:01:53,786
Now Apple has also been at the

43
00:01:54,106 --> 00:01:55,886
We now have these

44
00:01:55,886 --> 00:01:56,836
across our product line.

45
00:01:57,036 --> 00:01:58,046
People really, really love them.

46
00:01:58,506 --> 00:01:59,966
But what really is

47
00:02:00,756 --> 00:02:04,866
Well, last year we announced

48
00:02:04,866 --> 00:02:05,746
with P3 displays.

49
00:02:06,216 --> 00:02:07,876
And the feedback we got

50
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:10,036
They display 25 percent

51
00:02:10,386 --> 00:02:11,796
And they have the

52
00:02:11,796 --> 00:02:12,866
which people really,

53
00:02:13,396 --> 00:02:14,896
And if you fast forward

54
00:02:15,206 --> 00:02:18,876
we have these new iPad Pro

55
00:02:18,876 --> 00:02:20,146
So we've taken that

56
00:02:20,146 --> 00:02:22,296
Now, there's a lot

57
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:24,306
and we're going to try to get

58
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:26,916
And I'll start with

59
00:02:27,806 --> 00:02:29,506
Let's start very,

60
00:02:29,636 --> 00:02:31,516
So, what is a color space?

61
00:02:31,516 --> 00:02:33,286
Well a color space

62
00:02:33,366 --> 00:02:35,516
in which colors can be

63
00:02:35,846 --> 00:02:38,696
It can be a 1, 2, 3,

64
00:02:38,996 --> 00:02:41,926
that is defined by the intensity

65
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:45,656
Those color components

66
00:02:45,656 --> 00:02:46,446
to as color channels.

67
00:02:47,386 --> 00:02:49,946
One representation that you

68
00:02:50,346 --> 00:02:52,976
So, this is very

69
00:02:52,976 --> 00:02:54,796
where your subpixels are

70
00:02:54,796 --> 00:02:57,116
And to think about these

71
00:02:57,116 --> 00:02:58,516
that the intensity of each

72
00:02:58,516 --> 00:03:00,546
of these color channels

73
00:02:58,516 --> 00:03:00,546
of these color channels

74
00:03:00,546 --> 00:03:02,146
that you see on the other end.

75
00:03:03,356 --> 00:03:05,426
There's many different

76
00:03:05,606 --> 00:03:08,126
I mentioned RGB spaces, which

77
00:03:08,516 --> 00:03:10,696
But there's also lots

78
00:03:10,696 --> 00:03:12,036
which are used in

79
00:03:12,756 --> 00:03:15,356
In color printing we

80
00:03:15,766 --> 00:03:17,716
And if you're trying

81
00:03:17,716 --> 00:03:20,346
and transformations, we

82
00:03:20,346 --> 00:03:22,116
like LAB, which are

83
00:03:22,116 --> 00:03:28,126
So now we have color spaces, and

84
00:03:28,126 --> 00:03:29,256
to create a coordinate system

85
00:03:29,256 --> 00:03:30,916
where we can compare

86
00:03:31,316 --> 00:03:33,106
So there's the concept

87
00:03:33,696 --> 00:03:37,146
So color primaries generally

88
00:03:37,146 --> 00:03:39,516
that you can get with that

89
00:03:40,366 --> 00:03:43,596
So in this example of an RGB

90
00:03:43,596 --> 00:03:44,896
that the color primaries are

91
00:03:44,896 --> 00:03:47,836
where we anchor 1.0

92
00:03:48,306 --> 00:03:51,026
So for black, I would

93
00:03:51,026 --> 00:03:52,686
of my color channels,

94
00:03:53,276 --> 00:03:54,746
For white I would have 1, 1, 1.

95
00:03:55,106 --> 00:03:57,186
And for red I would only

96
00:03:57,496 --> 00:03:58,636
and I would have 1, 0, 0.

97
00:03:59,286 --> 00:03:59,726
Very simple.

98
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:03,646
And when we refer to color

99
00:04:03,646 --> 00:04:06,646
about all of the colors that

100
00:04:06,646 --> 00:04:08,116
of those individual

101
00:04:09,136 --> 00:04:11,326
So now you understand some

102
00:04:11,366 --> 00:04:12,946
that we're going to be

103
00:04:13,376 --> 00:04:14,856
So then what is wide color?

104
00:04:15,276 --> 00:04:17,406
Well first we should

105
00:04:17,446 --> 00:04:19,336
about what is the standard

106
00:04:20,216 --> 00:04:24,656
So standard RGB, or sRGB is the

107
00:04:24,656 --> 00:04:25,366
in computing today.

108
00:04:25,986 --> 00:04:27,826
It's based on the

109
00:04:28,246 --> 00:04:30,156
We use an approximated

110
00:04:30,596 --> 00:04:32,126
Typical lighting conditions.

111
00:04:32,126 --> 00:04:33,516
Which in this case is D65.

112
00:04:34,296 --> 00:04:36,546
And it's the default

113
00:04:36,826 --> 00:04:38,306
And it's actually the

114
00:04:38,306 --> 00:04:39,356
for a lot of platforms.

115
00:04:39,736 --> 00:04:41,776
Which is very convenient,

116
00:04:41,776 --> 00:04:42,886
out there that are

117
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:43,896
and there are some that are not.

118
00:04:44,296 --> 00:04:45,826
And when a lot of

119
00:04:45,826 --> 00:04:49,086
in existence today is sRGB,

120
00:04:49,196 --> 00:04:50,356
on your incoming content

121
00:04:50,356 --> 00:04:52,466
and have it reproduce

122
00:04:52,906 --> 00:04:54,406
But that's not always

123
00:04:54,796 --> 00:04:57,566
sRGB does a good job of

124
00:04:57,566 --> 00:04:59,986
with on a daily basis, and our

125
00:04:59,986 --> 00:05:01,276
at displaying those

126
00:04:59,986 --> 00:05:01,276
at displaying those

127
00:05:01,816 --> 00:05:05,546
But really there's a lot of

128
00:05:06,376 --> 00:05:09,536
A lot of textiles are

129
00:05:09,946 --> 00:05:11,896
that have lots of colors

130
00:05:11,896 --> 00:05:14,616
mainly because these

131
00:05:14,616 --> 00:05:16,086
They're really vivid

132
00:05:16,726 --> 00:05:18,366
If you're watching

133
00:05:18,476 --> 00:05:21,096
a lot of the uniforms are

134
00:05:21,096 --> 00:05:22,836
because they're striking,

135
00:05:23,126 --> 00:05:24,746
Whether you're watching

136
00:05:24,746 --> 00:05:26,386
or you're watching the

137
00:05:26,386 --> 00:05:27,966
to see a lot these

138
00:05:27,966 --> 00:05:29,816
that are actually not

139
00:05:29,816 --> 00:05:33,966
A lot of products are

140
00:05:33,966 --> 00:05:34,826
that are outside of sRGB.

141
00:05:34,826 --> 00:05:37,236
And these are products that we

142
00:05:38,236 --> 00:05:40,996
But really the most compelling

143
00:05:41,436 --> 00:05:44,926
Sunsets, autumn leaves,

144
00:05:45,176 --> 00:05:47,326
These are all things in

145
00:05:47,326 --> 00:05:48,246
that are outside of sRGB.

146
00:05:48,246 --> 00:05:50,866
And we actually want

147
00:05:51,126 --> 00:05:53,966
And the nice thing is you

148
00:05:53,966 --> 00:05:55,076
that you've taken

149
00:05:55,156 --> 00:05:56,586
especially if you're

150
00:05:56,926 --> 00:05:58,686
that actually contain a

151
00:05:58,686 --> 00:06:00,386
but you're not seeing

152
00:05:58,686 --> 00:06:00,386
but you're not seeing

153
00:06:00,386 --> 00:06:02,446
if your display is only sRGB.

154
00:06:03,076 --> 00:06:06,096
So what do we do about this?

155
00:06:06,306 --> 00:06:08,896
Well, last year as I mentioned,

156
00:06:08,896 --> 00:06:09,886
with a new color space.

157
00:06:09,956 --> 00:06:12,526
And that color space

158
00:06:12,526 --> 00:06:15,426
So in our iMacs, and in

159
00:06:15,786 --> 00:06:16,896
we use this color space.

160
00:06:16,896 --> 00:06:19,246
And it's based on the

161
00:06:19,246 --> 00:06:21,076
But it's a little bit different.

162
00:06:21,636 --> 00:06:25,076
DCI-P3 is a color space that is

163
00:06:25,076 --> 00:06:27,206
And it works really great

164
00:06:27,696 --> 00:06:30,086
But our viewing conditions

165
00:06:30,196 --> 00:06:33,766
And sRGB is really great at

166
00:06:33,766 --> 00:06:34,886
with our viewing conditions.

167
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:37,876
So we adopted the same gamma,

168
00:06:37,876 --> 00:06:39,586
for our white point, as sRGB.

169
00:06:39,586 --> 00:06:44,606
These are the key differences

170
00:06:44,956 --> 00:06:47,636
In order to understand what

171
00:06:47,636 --> 00:06:50,226
of sRGB, but can be

172
00:06:50,226 --> 00:06:52,586
I'll try to show it

173
00:06:54,216 --> 00:06:56,206
So here's an image

174
00:06:56,536 --> 00:06:59,766
and I exported it using photos

175
00:07:00,176 --> 00:07:01,456
This is a really

176
00:07:01,766 --> 00:07:04,256
and even though we're viewing

177
00:07:04,256 --> 00:07:06,766
or if you're viewing the video,

178
00:07:07,016 --> 00:07:08,546
This image still looks

179
00:07:08,546 --> 00:07:10,456
But there's a lot of

180
00:07:10,456 --> 00:07:14,036
that you might not notice right

181
00:07:14,036 --> 00:07:16,736
of colors that aren't

182
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:19,876
These are colors that are

183
00:07:20,226 --> 00:07:23,016
And in this case what you

184
00:07:23,016 --> 00:07:25,406
in those regions, so

185
00:07:25,406 --> 00:07:26,806
on the edge of the sRGB gamut.

186
00:07:28,216 --> 00:07:29,106
So how do we fix this?

187
00:07:29,106 --> 00:07:32,976
Well, we're moving more

188
00:07:33,096 --> 00:07:34,206
to our mobile platforms.

189
00:07:35,006 --> 00:07:36,286
And in order to enable that,

190
00:07:36,396 --> 00:07:38,966
it's not just putting a wide

191
00:07:38,966 --> 00:07:41,796
There's a number of other things

192
00:07:42,066 --> 00:07:43,426
One of those things is we need

193
00:07:43,426 --> 00:07:44,896
to upgrade our factory

194
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:49,076
So, now all of our products have

195
00:07:49,286 --> 00:07:50,936
that from device to

196
00:07:50,936 --> 00:07:52,776
on those colors being

197
00:07:53,156 --> 00:07:54,976
And then finally, we had

198
00:07:54,976 --> 00:07:58,186
to build full system-wide

199
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:00,006
And that's exactly

200
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:00,006
And that's exactly

201
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:04,956
But we can't just build the

202
00:08:05,186 --> 00:08:06,906
with the same approach

203
00:08:07,576 --> 00:08:10,766
There's different considerations

204
00:08:10,766 --> 00:08:12,006
when working with

205
00:08:12,626 --> 00:08:15,456
One of those considerations

206
00:08:15,456 --> 00:08:17,456
that already exist

207
00:08:18,056 --> 00:08:21,956
These are applications that are

208
00:08:21,956 --> 00:08:23,426
and performance in sRGB.

209
00:08:24,046 --> 00:08:26,776
So how do we make sure that

210
00:08:26,776 --> 00:08:28,536
on our platforms that

211
00:08:28,856 --> 00:08:30,466
without any impact

212
00:08:30,686 --> 00:08:32,186
without any impact

213
00:08:32,816 --> 00:08:35,316
And what we did is we

214
00:08:36,395 --> 00:08:39,775
So we've introduced an

215
00:08:40,155 --> 00:08:42,756
This is our working space

216
00:08:43,535 --> 00:08:45,766
We use the same sRGB primaries.

217
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:48,916
We use the same gamma 2.2.

218
00:08:49,326 --> 00:08:50,476
The same white point.

219
00:08:51,246 --> 00:08:53,356
But, the interesting

220
00:08:53,356 --> 00:08:55,736
that we actually allow values

221
00:08:55,876 --> 00:08:58,226
and less than zero,

222
00:08:58,226 --> 00:09:00,896
to not only keep the same

223
00:08:58,226 --> 00:09:00,896
to not only keep the same

224
00:09:00,896 --> 00:09:04,476
of your applications that are

225
00:09:04,476 --> 00:09:05,986
that are negative and

226
00:09:05,986 --> 00:09:09,176
than one allow us to express any

227
00:09:09,356 --> 00:09:11,586
while still keeping our

228
00:09:12,256 --> 00:09:15,646
The best way to describe

229
00:09:16,836 --> 00:09:19,806
So let's say I want to

230
00:09:19,846 --> 00:09:20,506
in Display P3.

231
00:09:20,506 --> 00:09:22,536
So that would be 1, 0, 0.

232
00:09:23,176 --> 00:09:25,926
Now, if want to express

233
00:09:25,926 --> 00:09:28,566
it would look a little

234
00:09:29,146 --> 00:09:31,136
So in the red channel,

235
00:09:31,136 --> 00:09:32,126
that is greater than one.

236
00:09:32,786 --> 00:09:34,376
And in the green

237
00:09:34,506 --> 00:09:36,226
I'm actually using

238
00:09:36,226 --> 00:09:38,176
So I'm subtracting

239
00:09:38,386 --> 00:09:40,106
and adding oversaturated red.

240
00:09:40,106 --> 00:09:43,346
And what that allows me to do

241
00:09:43,346 --> 00:09:47,806
of the sRGB gamut, while using

242
00:09:48,186 --> 00:09:49,986
in extended range sRGB.

243
00:09:51,636 --> 00:09:54,236
The interesting thing is if

244
00:09:54,436 --> 00:09:56,816
that allows you to go very

245
00:09:57,196 --> 00:09:59,406
this approach allows

246
00:09:59,406 --> 00:09:59,976
in the visual spectrum.

247
00:10:00,136 --> 00:10:01,656
So this is scalable.

248
00:10:02,116 --> 00:10:05,966
Speaking of pixel formats,

249
00:10:07,406 --> 00:10:11,576
sRGB is largely standardized

250
00:10:11,576 --> 00:10:16,156
So 8 bits is largely enough

251
00:10:16,936 --> 00:10:17,966
not perfect, but great.

252
00:10:18,456 --> 00:10:20,896
Now an easy example to

253
00:10:20,896 --> 00:10:23,066
between the precision that

254
00:10:23,066 --> 00:10:24,916
and the precision

255
00:10:24,996 --> 00:10:27,966
for wider gamut, is

256
00:10:28,076 --> 00:10:30,716
So say I wanted to build

257
00:10:30,856 --> 00:10:32,146
from the basement

258
00:10:32,526 --> 00:10:35,186
I would use, say 8 stairs, I'd

259
00:10:35,186 --> 00:10:36,396
for simplicity I would use 8.

260
00:10:37,586 --> 00:10:39,016
This is the appropriate

261
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:42,156
Now, if I wanted to extend that

262
00:10:42,156 --> 00:10:44,476
I wouldn't just use the

263
00:10:44,656 --> 00:10:46,556
And when we're using

264
00:10:47,066 --> 00:10:49,626
it makes sense that if you're

265
00:10:49,936 --> 00:10:51,616
you would want to

266
00:10:57,136 --> 00:10:59,796
So if we're talking about using

267
00:10:59,796 --> 00:11:03,666
really our recommendation is to

268
00:10:59,796 --> 00:11:03,666
really our recommendation is to

269
00:11:04,266 --> 00:11:07,926
Now, before I hand

270
00:11:08,076 --> 00:11:09,796
I wanted to end with

271
00:11:09,796 --> 00:11:12,786
So, we've gone through our

272
00:11:12,786 --> 00:11:15,256
of our frameworks and

273
00:11:15,756 --> 00:11:17,306
But if you're building

274
00:11:17,306 --> 00:11:18,486
with open source tools,

275
00:11:18,846 --> 00:11:21,476
or you've built your own

276
00:11:21,476 --> 00:11:24,526
from scratch, you need to

277
00:11:24,526 --> 00:11:27,436
that the tools that you've

278
00:11:28,106 --> 00:11:29,746
Otherwise, we've

279
00:11:30,206 --> 00:11:32,386
And for more on that, I'll

280
00:11:33,516 --> 00:11:36,546
[ Applause ]

281
00:11:37,046 --> 00:11:37,626
&gt;&gt; Thank you Justin.

282
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:39,876
Hi. I'm Patrick Heynen.

283
00:11:39,876 --> 00:11:42,226
I'm a Senior Engineering Manager

284
00:11:42,786 --> 00:11:45,786
And I'd like to ask where

285
00:11:45,966 --> 00:11:48,146
Well the answer is it turns

286
00:11:48,606 --> 00:11:50,396
No, it comes from you.

287
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:54,026
Namely, it comes from

288
00:11:54,516 --> 00:11:55,846
and the user experiences

289
00:11:55,846 --> 00:11:57,246
that you provide in

290
00:11:58,466 --> 00:12:01,666
So what kind of content types

291
00:11:58,466 --> 00:12:01,666
So what kind of content types

292
00:12:02,626 --> 00:12:05,226
Well the first one is the one

293
00:12:05,226 --> 00:12:06,836
with and that's static

294
00:12:06,906 --> 00:12:09,476
These are the sort

295
00:12:09,476 --> 00:12:12,016
or individual graphic files

296
00:12:12,016 --> 00:12:13,666
into your application

297
00:12:13,726 --> 00:12:16,136
with your application

298
00:12:17,696 --> 00:12:20,006
The next category is document

299
00:12:20,006 --> 00:12:21,646
and network-based

300
00:12:21,646 --> 00:12:24,206
These are individual

301
00:12:24,526 --> 00:12:27,426
that you may either download

302
00:12:27,736 --> 00:12:31,906
or store in your document data.

303
00:12:32,086 --> 00:12:34,446
There's also further

304
00:12:34,446 --> 00:12:37,256
which refers to things like

305
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:39,516
from the build-in

306
00:12:39,596 --> 00:12:43,496
I'm not going to go

307
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:47,706
about wide color implications

308
00:12:47,706 --> 00:12:50,036
but I refer you to the

309
00:12:50,316 --> 00:12:53,536
and Editing Live Photos

310
00:12:53,536 --> 00:12:54,546
for more details about that.

311
00:12:55,476 --> 00:12:58,636
And lastly, there's also

312
00:12:58,636 --> 00:13:00,786
If your program -- if your

313
00:12:58,636 --> 00:13:00,786
If your program -- if your

314
00:13:00,786 --> 00:13:04,336
at the GPU level, like your game

315
00:13:04,336 --> 00:13:07,486
of graphic software, and you're

316
00:13:07,486 --> 00:13:09,436
in the form of either

317
00:13:09,696 --> 00:13:12,226
to the GPU directly, there

318
00:13:12,226 --> 00:13:13,866
as well for wide content.

319
00:13:14,336 --> 00:13:16,766
I'm not going to go into much

320
00:13:16,766 --> 00:13:20,016
but I refer you to my colleague,

321
00:13:20,016 --> 00:13:23,376
of this in What's

322
00:13:23,596 --> 00:13:26,106
Okay. So let's frame

323
00:13:26,826 --> 00:13:28,706
Justin gave a great

324
00:13:28,706 --> 00:13:31,086
But how does it apply to apps?

325
00:13:31,606 --> 00:13:37,356
Well app content can come from a

326
00:13:37,356 --> 00:13:38,776
in a broad range

327
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:40,106
all the way from grayscale,

328
00:13:40,106 --> 00:13:44,686
all the way through to even

329
00:13:45,756 --> 00:13:49,826
At the same time, devices and

330
00:13:49,826 --> 00:13:51,006
of color capabilities.

331
00:13:51,186 --> 00:13:54,796
For example, in iPhone

332
00:13:54,796 --> 00:13:58,316
of representing sRGB, all the

333
00:13:58,316 --> 00:14:01,206
which does a great job

334
00:13:58,316 --> 00:14:01,206
which does a great job

335
00:14:01,206 --> 00:14:02,796
and extended range sRGB.

336
00:14:03,336 --> 00:14:05,096
So, how do you bridge

337
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:08,656
Well, we're going to

338
00:14:09,276 --> 00:14:12,416
And the backbone really

339
00:14:14,736 --> 00:14:16,176
So, what is color management?

340
00:14:17,596 --> 00:14:20,136
The job of color

341
00:14:20,746 --> 00:14:23,396
that an image looks the

342
00:14:23,726 --> 00:14:25,976
no matter what color

343
00:14:25,976 --> 00:14:27,136
or how it was originally

344
00:14:27,956 --> 00:14:28,796
That's pretty much it.

345
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:33,606
But how does it work?

346
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:36,726
Color management

347
00:14:36,726 --> 00:14:39,046
or content type having an

348
00:14:39,246 --> 00:14:40,876
sometimes referred

349
00:14:42,496 --> 00:14:45,446
This informs the system what

350
00:14:45,586 --> 00:14:49,206
And then the color matching

351
00:14:49,206 --> 00:14:52,086
those colors to the

352
00:14:52,146 --> 00:14:53,556
of the device that

353
00:14:54,126 --> 00:14:57,716
Of course, this is a

354
00:14:57,716 --> 00:14:58,806
and it is not for free.

355
00:14:58,806 --> 00:15:00,756
In fact, every single

356
00:14:58,806 --> 00:15:00,756
In fact, every single

357
00:15:00,756 --> 00:15:03,146
and converted and matched.

358
00:15:03,326 --> 00:15:05,706
Also, it's important to

359
00:15:05,706 --> 00:15:06,756
lossy operation.

360
00:15:06,986 --> 00:15:09,616
Especially if you're going

361
00:15:09,976 --> 00:15:13,146
down to a narrower one,

362
00:15:13,146 --> 00:15:16,226
down to an sRGB 8-bit,

363
00:15:16,226 --> 00:15:18,526
of color fidelity

364
00:15:18,526 --> 00:15:20,116
So that's something

365
00:15:20,116 --> 00:15:24,066
So these are important

366
00:15:24,646 --> 00:15:28,286
The first good news is that

367
00:15:28,376 --> 00:15:30,636
the way they're algorithmically

368
00:15:30,636 --> 00:15:32,096
into the details of the

369
00:15:32,096 --> 00:15:34,056
But it turns out

370
00:15:34,056 --> 00:15:35,586
they're very easily

371
00:15:35,946 --> 00:15:37,986
either by the CPU or by GPU.

372
00:15:39,216 --> 00:15:41,076
Which leads to the

373
00:15:41,346 --> 00:15:42,966
that we've built

374
00:15:42,966 --> 00:15:46,466
into the system itself, so that

375
00:15:46,466 --> 00:15:49,716
the Quartz 2D, ColorSync on

376
00:15:50,276 --> 00:15:53,616
In fact, all you really

377
00:15:53,616 --> 00:15:58,036
that your content is tagged

378
00:15:58,036 --> 00:16:00,356
there's no code required to

379
00:15:58,036 --> 00:16:00,356
there's no code required to

380
00:16:00,356 --> 00:16:03,416
and have the colors

381
00:16:03,536 --> 00:16:04,936
So, platform color management.

382
00:16:05,486 --> 00:16:09,076
Well, macOS, as Justin eluded

383
00:16:09,076 --> 00:16:10,926
to has been color managed

384
00:16:10,996 --> 00:16:13,036
Some might even say since

385
00:16:13,036 --> 00:16:14,556
when it was previously

386
00:16:14,976 --> 00:16:16,566
during the ColorSync times.

387
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:18,316
So there's nothing new there,

388
00:16:18,316 --> 00:16:20,186
but there is something

389
00:16:20,186 --> 00:16:22,496
We have, since iOS 9.3,

390
00:16:22,496 --> 00:16:24,366
we now have automatic

391
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:25,286
on most devices.

392
00:16:25,556 --> 00:16:29,016
So that's color management,

393
00:16:29,016 --> 00:16:30,466
of solving the color problem.

394
00:16:32,396 --> 00:16:36,446
But now let's talk about how

395
00:16:36,446 --> 00:16:39,656
and how the toolchain and the

396
00:16:39,656 --> 00:16:42,806
enhanced to accommodate

397
00:16:42,806 --> 00:16:43,756
into your applications.

398
00:16:44,526 --> 00:16:47,196
First, as always it

399
00:16:48,736 --> 00:16:50,926
So, what is important to think

400
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:53,186
about when you're

401
00:16:53,186 --> 00:16:56,816
from a design perspective?

402
00:16:56,816 --> 00:17:00,406
Well, the first thing I would

403
00:16:56,816 --> 00:17:00,406
Well, the first thing I would

404
00:17:00,406 --> 00:17:03,186
to use wide gamut content

405
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:06,665
It doesn't mean everywhere,

406
00:17:06,665 --> 00:17:09,796
that we interact with on a daily

407
00:17:09,796 --> 00:17:11,236
within that nice sRGB triangle.

408
00:17:11,236 --> 00:17:12,596
That's where the bulk

409
00:17:13,596 --> 00:17:16,846
There are however, these nice,

410
00:17:17,175 --> 00:17:20,376
that may make sense for

411
00:17:20,786 --> 00:17:22,786
So really it's important to

412
00:17:22,786 --> 00:17:24,276
as being a tool that you can use

413
00:17:24,526 --> 00:17:27,066
where vivid colors really

414
00:17:27,066 --> 00:17:28,786
and add some value

415
00:17:30,116 --> 00:17:33,786
There is no need to go and

416
00:17:34,036 --> 00:17:35,826
and immediately upgrade

417
00:17:35,826 --> 00:17:38,056
This is not that kind

418
00:17:38,156 --> 00:17:40,956
This is merely a new

419
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:43,206
where you want it,

420
00:17:43,506 --> 00:17:46,146
And the good news is we've

421
00:17:46,426 --> 00:17:49,726
to make this gradual opt-in

422
00:17:51,716 --> 00:17:54,626
So let's say you do want

423
00:17:54,626 --> 00:17:56,286
to wide color, what are

424
00:17:56,656 --> 00:17:58,336
It's really important

425
00:17:58,726 --> 00:18:02,686
when you upgrade a

426
00:17:58,726 --> 00:18:02,686
when you upgrade a

427
00:18:04,196 --> 00:18:07,476
A common pitfall is to

428
00:18:07,656 --> 00:18:10,946
It starts out as sRB, assigning

429
00:18:11,306 --> 00:18:13,986
This is a mistake, because this

430
00:18:13,986 --> 00:18:15,546
color information

431
00:18:15,806 --> 00:18:18,226
It's a pretty effect, but it's

432
00:18:18,276 --> 00:18:21,136
Because it will just stretch

433
00:18:21,136 --> 00:18:24,546
and the appearance of the design

434
00:18:25,086 --> 00:18:29,866
Instead, it's important to

435
00:18:30,756 --> 00:18:34,156
This will actually do a

436
00:18:34,156 --> 00:18:36,576
your resulting design should

437
00:18:36,846 --> 00:18:39,446
but it will be prepared

438
00:18:39,446 --> 00:18:41,456
of its content boosted

439
00:18:41,456 --> 00:18:43,476
vivid saturated P3 colors.

440
00:18:45,316 --> 00:18:48,816
When you're working on wide

441
00:18:48,816 --> 00:18:50,386
to use, and we recommend

442
00:18:50,386 --> 00:18:52,426
that you use the

443
00:18:52,696 --> 00:18:54,406
as your working document

444
00:18:56,026 --> 00:18:58,676
Also to maintain

445
00:18:58,676 --> 00:19:01,036
and highest quality

446
00:18:58,676 --> 00:19:01,036
and highest quality

447
00:19:01,036 --> 00:19:02,966
in 16-bit per channel

448
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:08,916
And of course, it's nice to

449
00:19:09,256 --> 00:19:11,676
So, if you are going

450
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:14,246
with wide color it's good

451
00:19:14,246 --> 00:19:16,666
on a system capable of

452
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:20,196
such as the late 2015 iMac,

453
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:24,676
When it comes time

454
00:19:24,676 --> 00:19:28,006
for exporting delivering

455
00:19:28,006 --> 00:19:32,956
to use 16-bit PNG files with an

456
00:19:33,286 --> 00:19:36,786
This is sort of the gold

457
00:19:36,786 --> 00:19:38,426
for wide color content.

458
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:41,606
Now, a brief note.

459
00:19:42,496 --> 00:19:45,766
There are some very popular

460
00:19:45,766 --> 00:19:46,226
out there.

461
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:47,576
They come under different names.

462
00:19:47,576 --> 00:19:48,526
I'm going to talk specifically

463
00:19:48,526 --> 00:19:50,606
about the Adobe Photoshop

464
00:19:50,716 --> 00:19:53,966
They come under the names of

465
00:19:54,246 --> 00:19:56,586
Many of these workflows

466
00:19:56,586 --> 00:19:59,826
to wide color yet, and

467
00:19:59,826 --> 00:20:01,946
with exporting 16-bit

468
00:19:59,826 --> 00:20:01,946
with exporting 16-bit

469
00:20:02,246 --> 00:20:04,276
So, stay away from them for now.

470
00:20:04,746 --> 00:20:08,726
And instead use the workaround

471
00:20:09,086 --> 00:20:14,916
with 16-bit and embedded

472
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:16,406
Okay, so that's the

473
00:20:16,406 --> 00:20:17,866
and how wide color impacts that.

474
00:20:18,776 --> 00:20:22,036
Now, let's talk about tools

475
00:20:22,176 --> 00:20:24,716
up to incorporate the

476
00:20:24,716 --> 00:20:25,886
out of the design process.

477
00:20:26,256 --> 00:20:27,776
Well the first thing

478
00:20:27,776 --> 00:20:28,816
and really the epicenter

479
00:20:28,816 --> 00:20:32,096
of the content tool story

480
00:20:32,556 --> 00:20:34,056
Now you may be familiar

481
00:20:34,356 --> 00:20:37,596
This is the general tool in

482
00:20:37,596 --> 00:20:40,136
and catalog your image

483
00:20:40,136 --> 00:20:41,006
and provide metadata,

484
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:43,686
and deliver it inside

485
00:20:44,216 --> 00:20:47,576
What do asset catalogs

486
00:20:47,576 --> 00:20:49,496
Well, they're the best

487
00:20:49,496 --> 00:20:50,506
for static assets.

488
00:20:51,856 --> 00:20:56,286
We automatically color

489
00:20:56,286 --> 00:20:58,536
and optimize it for the target

490
00:20:58,776 --> 00:21:01,676
So even if, maybe your

491
00:20:58,776 --> 00:21:01,676
So even if, maybe your

492
00:21:01,676 --> 00:21:03,866
and always can deliver their

493
00:21:03,866 --> 00:21:07,006
and all the right information

494
00:21:07,006 --> 00:21:08,756
but that may not

495
00:21:09,066 --> 00:21:11,326
That's where this automatic

496
00:21:11,326 --> 00:21:13,216
to make sure that we

497
00:21:13,216 --> 00:21:17,896
into the appropriate working

498
00:21:18,046 --> 00:21:20,456
Also, we do automatic

499
00:21:20,456 --> 00:21:22,046
making sure that the

500
00:21:22,046 --> 00:21:23,016
up in the right device.

501
00:21:23,556 --> 00:21:27,776
And, last, but definitely

502
00:21:27,776 --> 00:21:29,976
asset catalogs are the

503
00:21:30,436 --> 00:21:32,386
which is an important component

504
00:21:32,386 --> 00:21:35,256
that assures that only the

505
00:21:35,256 --> 00:21:37,506
delivered to your customers on

506
00:21:37,506 --> 00:21:40,276
of the content that doesn't.

507
00:21:40,376 --> 00:21:43,686
So, what have we done in asset

508
00:21:43,686 --> 00:21:45,066
to work with wide color content?

509
00:21:46,486 --> 00:21:49,776
Well the first important

510
00:21:49,776 --> 00:21:53,156
bit source content and

511
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:56,506
for 16 bit image resources.

512
00:21:56,506 --> 00:21:58,566
This, we store it

513
00:21:58,926 --> 00:22:02,266
but it is available

514
00:21:58,926 --> 00:22:02,266
but it is available

515
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:05,786
The next important thing

516
00:22:05,786 --> 00:22:08,256
to catalog a display gamut.

517
00:22:09,456 --> 00:22:10,116
What does this mean?

518
00:22:10,116 --> 00:22:14,046
This means that you really

519
00:22:14,046 --> 00:22:18,946
in the inspector to provide

520
00:22:18,946 --> 00:22:22,196
for either the sRGB

521
00:22:22,196 --> 00:22:25,206
display gamuts matching devices

522
00:22:25,776 --> 00:22:29,036
Okay so that's the feature.

523
00:22:29,036 --> 00:22:31,586
That's what Xcode has to

524
00:22:31,586 --> 00:22:32,346
But how do you use it?

525
00:22:32,346 --> 00:22:33,456
How do you think about using it?

526
00:22:33,556 --> 00:22:36,986
Well, there's really

527
00:22:37,176 --> 00:22:40,996
Choice number one, do nothing.

528
00:22:42,386 --> 00:22:44,686
This may seem radical, but it is

529
00:22:44,686 --> 00:22:47,916
in fact a perfectly

530
00:22:48,146 --> 00:22:50,466
Because if you make no

531
00:22:50,466 --> 00:22:52,326
you may not need any of

532
00:22:52,326 --> 00:22:56,046
we will continue to render your

533
00:22:56,396 --> 00:22:57,306
on all devices.

534
00:22:57,736 --> 00:22:58,676
So nothing will change.

535
00:22:58,676 --> 00:23:00,516
You don't need to go

536
00:22:58,676 --> 00:23:00,516
You don't need to go

537
00:23:00,516 --> 00:23:02,256
to make sure it works

538
00:23:02,346 --> 00:23:04,476
So this is a perfectly

539
00:23:04,476 --> 00:23:08,376
Of course, this does mean

540
00:23:08,376 --> 00:23:09,096
wide colors.

541
00:23:09,946 --> 00:23:11,906
That's a perfectly

542
00:23:12,326 --> 00:23:14,656
That's the outcome of

543
00:23:15,316 --> 00:23:17,186
So let's say you do want

544
00:23:17,186 --> 00:23:19,676
to use some wide color

545
00:23:19,896 --> 00:23:21,056
Brings us to choice number two.

546
00:23:21,136 --> 00:23:23,236
Upgrade to P3.

547
00:23:24,536 --> 00:23:27,436
So, the way this

548
00:23:27,436 --> 00:23:29,006
like to call Universal P3 Asset.

549
00:23:29,506 --> 00:23:33,986
So, all it involves is taking

550
00:23:33,986 --> 00:23:35,016
that you may have gotten

551
00:23:35,016 --> 00:23:37,486
and just replace your existing

552
00:23:37,746 --> 00:23:39,256
with this upgraded asset.

553
00:23:40,846 --> 00:23:42,626
What happens at build

554
00:23:42,626 --> 00:23:45,336
to automatically generate

555
00:23:45,876 --> 00:23:48,656
from that 16 bit

556
00:23:48,916 --> 00:23:51,296
We're going to do a

557
00:23:51,426 --> 00:23:53,606
and a high quality

558
00:23:54,116 --> 00:23:56,946
And then of course at

559
00:23:56,946 --> 00:23:59,616
we're make sure the right

560
00:23:59,616 --> 00:24:01,286
on the appropriate device.

561
00:23:59,616 --> 00:24:01,286
on the appropriate device.

562
00:24:03,176 --> 00:24:04,906
But let's say you're

563
00:24:04,906 --> 00:24:07,636
with this automatic conversion

564
00:24:08,346 --> 00:24:10,546
Well the good news is we

565
00:24:10,546 --> 00:24:13,186
And that's choice number

566
00:24:13,736 --> 00:24:15,456
It's a very simple option.

567
00:24:15,456 --> 00:24:20,876
It's basically, you provide

568
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:23,046
and your original

569
00:24:23,306 --> 00:24:25,946
We provide places for

570
00:24:25,946 --> 00:24:26,896
of those in the asset catalog.

571
00:24:27,216 --> 00:24:29,416
And they'll get built

572
00:24:29,416 --> 00:24:30,276
and thinned appropriately.

573
00:24:31,426 --> 00:24:36,946
Okay, that's wide color

574
00:24:38,266 --> 00:24:40,366
I'd like to now give

575
00:24:40,366 --> 00:24:45,456
of creating content.

576
00:24:45,456 --> 00:24:49,966
Okay, so let's say I've got

577
00:24:56,336 --> 00:24:58,656
Let's say I have this

578
00:24:58,776 --> 00:24:59,306
There we go.

579
00:24:59,306 --> 00:25:00,116
That's much better.

580
00:24:59,306 --> 00:25:00,116
That's much better.

581
00:25:00,816 --> 00:25:04,346
And I really decided this

582
00:25:04,346 --> 00:25:06,096
from some more vivid

583
00:25:06,596 --> 00:25:07,416
How is this done?

584
00:25:07,726 --> 00:25:08,736
Let's take a look at this here.

585
00:25:08,736 --> 00:25:10,836
This is just a simple gradient

586
00:25:10,836 --> 00:25:13,306
And I just want to call

587
00:25:13,306 --> 00:25:16,286
in the gradient is a

588
00:25:17,496 --> 00:25:18,786
Okay, that's what

589
00:25:20,376 --> 00:25:22,266
So what do I do to upgrade it?

590
00:25:22,266 --> 00:25:24,336
Well the first thing

591
00:25:24,756 --> 00:25:28,096
because I'm an organized type,

592
00:25:28,096 --> 00:25:30,276
of this and not just

593
00:25:30,276 --> 00:25:34,646
I'm going to name it

594
00:25:34,646 --> 00:25:36,776
And, okay now I'm ready to work.

595
00:25:37,396 --> 00:25:39,806
So the first thing I'm going to

596
00:25:39,806 --> 00:25:41,716
to 16 bits per channel.

597
00:25:42,806 --> 00:25:44,146
Now, we're ready

598
00:25:44,396 --> 00:25:47,846
And now the all-important

599
00:25:49,186 --> 00:25:51,876
And what I'm going to do

600
00:25:51,876 --> 00:25:54,486
to the Display P3 color profile.

601
00:25:56,416 --> 00:25:58,286
Okay, now we're ready to go.

602
00:25:58,666 --> 00:26:01,136
In fact, I can confirm with

603
00:25:58,666 --> 00:26:01,136
In fact, I can confirm with

604
00:26:01,506 --> 00:26:03,606
Display P3, 16 bits

605
00:26:03,606 --> 00:26:04,186
I'm good to go.

606
00:26:04,666 --> 00:26:05,596
Okay, so now let's take a look

607
00:26:05,596 --> 00:26:06,696
at what happened

608
00:26:06,786 --> 00:26:09,636
And look at our favorite

609
00:26:10,956 --> 00:26:12,146
Okay, so that's interesting

610
00:26:12,606 --> 00:26:13,926
That green it didn't change.

611
00:26:13,926 --> 00:26:16,616
Notice that the hue wheel didn't

612
00:26:16,706 --> 00:26:18,436
That was actually the

613
00:26:18,536 --> 00:26:19,246
as opposed to assigning.

614
00:26:20,126 --> 00:26:21,916
But I'm left with

615
00:26:21,916 --> 00:26:23,466
being only 70 percent saturated.

616
00:26:23,466 --> 00:26:26,096
Well this really indicates just

617
00:26:26,096 --> 00:26:29,286
is to punch out into

618
00:26:29,286 --> 00:26:31,226
and deploy a more purer green.

619
00:26:31,806 --> 00:26:34,496
So, well let's say I want to

620
00:26:34,496 --> 00:26:37,386
on stage all day, I'm just going

621
00:26:37,676 --> 00:26:41,246
Now everything should be

622
00:26:41,246 --> 00:26:43,396
100 percent saturated, but now

623
00:26:43,826 --> 00:26:47,326
in that pure P3 wide

624
00:26:47,986 --> 00:26:48,566
So there we are.

625
00:26:48,566 --> 00:26:52,796
Now I have my beautiful asset,

626
00:26:52,996 --> 00:26:56,436
And of course this is just a

627
00:26:56,436 --> 00:26:58,826
in my app until I save it.

628
00:26:58,826 --> 00:26:59,906
So I'm going to do that.

629
00:26:59,906 --> 00:27:01,936
I'm going to save it as, whoops

630
00:26:59,906 --> 00:27:01,936
I'm going to save it as, whoops

631
00:27:01,936 --> 00:27:05,676
I'm going to make sure to

632
00:27:06,846 --> 00:27:07,886
And save it.

633
00:27:08,956 --> 00:27:10,126
And viola I'm done.

634
00:27:10,346 --> 00:27:11,766
Well, actually I'm not done,

635
00:27:11,766 --> 00:27:13,006
I've just finished

636
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:14,466
I haven't incorporated

637
00:27:15,256 --> 00:27:17,196
So, let's go do that.

638
00:27:20,496 --> 00:27:21,176
Where's my app?

639
00:27:21,236 --> 00:27:21,666
There's my app.

640
00:27:22,196 --> 00:27:24,336
So here's my app, unmodified.

641
00:27:24,636 --> 00:27:27,416
Here's my existing

642
00:27:28,776 --> 00:27:30,836
Well, what I want to do here

643
00:27:30,836 --> 00:27:35,256
to the pop-up here to expose

644
00:27:35,606 --> 00:27:37,586
This will immediately

645
00:27:37,586 --> 00:27:38,956
of additional cataloging

646
00:27:39,516 --> 00:27:42,056
And I take my P3 hue wheel

647
00:27:42,056 --> 00:27:44,006
and just drop it

648
00:27:44,626 --> 00:27:45,356
And I'm ready to go.

649
00:27:45,356 --> 00:27:48,856
Now if I build in run, it

650
00:27:48,856 --> 00:27:50,006
into my asset catalog.

651
00:27:50,206 --> 00:27:52,716
And if I was running on

652
00:27:53,026 --> 00:27:56,046
I would be getting the

653
00:27:56,366 --> 00:27:59,076
whereas on an sRGB

654
00:27:59,346 --> 00:28:01,876
I would be getting this asset.

655
00:27:59,346 --> 00:28:01,876
I would be getting this asset.

656
00:28:02,076 --> 00:28:07,536
Okay. That's incorporating

657
00:28:11,316 --> 00:28:13,346
Okay so we talked about tools

658
00:28:14,336 --> 00:28:15,686
and how they work

659
00:28:15,926 --> 00:28:18,166
Now it's time to talk about some

660
00:28:18,166 --> 00:28:19,696
and what happens after

661
00:28:19,696 --> 00:28:22,036
and how it might impact the

662
00:28:23,286 --> 00:28:27,786
So, with asset catalog

663
00:28:27,786 --> 00:28:30,356
to ensure that the

664
00:28:30,356 --> 00:28:31,446
to a given device.

665
00:28:31,826 --> 00:28:32,796
And this is really important

666
00:28:32,796 --> 00:28:35,026
because this is potentially a

667
00:28:35,026 --> 00:28:35,766
of your application.

668
00:28:36,526 --> 00:28:38,416
And, with that slicing,

669
00:28:38,696 --> 00:28:40,666
we ensure that there's

670
00:28:40,836 --> 00:28:42,586
for your actual end-user

671
00:28:42,586 --> 00:28:45,736
for adding this wide gamut

672
00:28:45,736 --> 00:28:47,456
because we make sure

673
00:28:47,776 --> 00:28:50,136
wide gamut content only

674
00:28:50,496 --> 00:28:52,416
sRGB content goes

675
00:28:52,876 --> 00:28:55,006
And it doesn't waste

676
00:28:55,006 --> 00:28:56,066
that it's not relevant for.

677
00:28:56,596 --> 00:29:01,996
On the Mac, there's

678
00:28:56,596 --> 00:29:01,996
On the Mac, there's

679
00:29:01,996 --> 00:29:04,546
NSImage has always been able to

680
00:29:04,546 --> 00:29:07,736
from available representations

681
00:29:07,736 --> 00:29:11,156
It's going to continue to do

682
00:29:11,156 --> 00:29:12,036
of your target display.

683
00:29:12,296 --> 00:29:14,976
So if you are on a wide

684
00:29:14,976 --> 00:29:18,646
and you have P3 content

685
00:29:18,646 --> 00:29:20,536
it's going to go

686
00:29:20,536 --> 00:29:22,456
that when rendering its content.

687
00:29:22,976 --> 00:29:27,116
Also, just like the behavior

688
00:29:27,116 --> 00:29:29,366
on the Mac, NSImage

689
00:29:29,366 --> 00:29:31,226
and all the related app

690
00:29:31,226 --> 00:29:33,136
to refresh the content

691
00:29:33,136 --> 00:29:35,066
when the display

692
00:29:35,316 --> 00:29:37,336
Such as when your window

693
00:29:37,336 --> 00:29:40,906
and the external display, or

694
00:29:40,906 --> 00:29:42,616
or back end scale

695
00:29:43,806 --> 00:29:44,386
So that's great.

696
00:29:45,046 --> 00:29:47,746
Okay, but how is this

697
00:29:47,746 --> 00:29:51,056
and what impact can that

698
00:29:51,826 --> 00:29:55,646
Well the good news is that at

699
00:29:55,646 --> 00:29:59,136
to optimize the pixel formats

700
00:29:59,176 --> 00:30:01,676
of all your image content

701
00:29:59,176 --> 00:30:01,676
of all your image content

702
00:30:02,556 --> 00:30:04,736
And do so in as efficient

703
00:30:04,736 --> 00:30:06,806
to the best of our

704
00:30:07,156 --> 00:30:10,236
We do now use 16 bit

705
00:30:10,596 --> 00:30:12,496
for wide color content.

706
00:30:12,856 --> 00:30:13,776
I mentioned this before.

707
00:30:13,776 --> 00:30:17,356
This really allows you to

708
00:30:17,356 --> 00:30:20,256
precision in your

709
00:30:21,466 --> 00:30:24,186
And, we also have compression.

710
00:30:25,356 --> 00:30:29,416
Now this is quite handy because

711
00:30:29,816 --> 00:30:32,666
More information is

712
00:30:32,786 --> 00:30:35,296
to large footprint unless

713
00:30:35,296 --> 00:30:36,496
Now, we've always

714
00:30:36,496 --> 00:30:37,866
we've always had

715
00:30:38,496 --> 00:30:40,716
Akin to what happens

716
00:30:41,646 --> 00:30:45,566
But what's new this year is

717
00:30:45,566 --> 00:30:50,016
to help counteract, you

718
00:30:50,016 --> 00:30:53,696
The first one of these is what

719
00:30:54,106 --> 00:30:57,436
Now this is a compression system

720
00:30:57,436 --> 00:30:59,836
except the added bonus that it

721
00:30:59,836 --> 00:31:00,566
and alpha as well.

722
00:30:59,836 --> 00:31:00,566
and alpha as well.

723
00:31:01,156 --> 00:31:04,416
It has a similar

724
00:31:04,416 --> 00:31:05,966
and performance characteristics.

725
00:31:06,436 --> 00:31:10,676
And the great news is it

726
00:31:10,906 --> 00:31:13,246
on almost all, on

727
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:14,156
Just like JPEG does.

728
00:31:14,156 --> 00:31:16,066
So it's something you can count

729
00:31:16,066 --> 00:31:19,736
on to give a very slight

730
00:31:19,736 --> 00:31:21,616
to get a really excellent

731
00:31:23,056 --> 00:31:25,146
Now, new this year as well,

732
00:31:25,146 --> 00:31:27,476
we have this exciting option

733
00:31:27,476 --> 00:31:28,706
using ASTC.

734
00:31:29,966 --> 00:31:32,776
So this stands for Advanced

735
00:31:32,776 --> 00:31:36,626
which is a GPU compressed

736
00:31:36,956 --> 00:31:41,376
which many modern GPUs

737
00:31:41,376 --> 00:31:42,626
as other systems support.

738
00:31:44,336 --> 00:31:48,176
And we have brought this

739
00:31:48,176 --> 00:31:49,786
in two different forms.

740
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:54,296
One is GPU best quality,

741
00:31:54,296 --> 00:31:56,856
4 bits per pixel,

742
00:31:57,126 --> 00:31:59,296
Which is a great choice,

743
00:31:59,296 --> 00:32:02,946
of visual performance and visual

744
00:31:59,296 --> 00:32:02,946
of visual performance and visual

745
00:32:03,436 --> 00:32:07,786
And then we also have

746
00:32:07,786 --> 00:32:10,226
where if you're really wanting

747
00:32:10,456 --> 00:32:11,496
and your memory footprint,

748
00:32:11,856 --> 00:32:14,576
greatly then you

749
00:32:14,576 --> 00:32:16,696
and that's a 1 bit per pixel

750
00:32:16,696 --> 00:32:18,356
which has excellent

751
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:23,306
Of course, since not

752
00:32:23,306 --> 00:32:27,236
that is supported today

753
00:32:28,476 --> 00:32:29,706
we take an extra step for you

754
00:32:29,706 --> 00:32:33,786
and automatically generate a

755
00:32:33,786 --> 00:32:34,986
that lack that capability.

756
00:32:35,336 --> 00:32:37,386
What's great about this is it

757
00:32:37,856 --> 00:32:40,426
about having incompatibilities

758
00:32:40,736 --> 00:32:41,986
for all the supported devices,

759
00:32:41,986 --> 00:32:43,546
we're going to automatically

760
00:32:43,546 --> 00:32:45,516
and use it and thin it,

761
00:32:45,516 --> 00:32:47,646
to those devices that

762
00:32:48,816 --> 00:32:53,476
So you can use GPU compression

763
00:32:53,476 --> 00:32:54,606
of compatibility breakage.

764
00:32:55,586 --> 00:32:58,466
A brief note about how

765
00:32:58,466 --> 00:33:00,176
with wide color assets

766
00:32:58,466 --> 00:33:00,176
with wide color assets

767
00:33:01,166 --> 00:33:07,126
So, we use the ASTC Low Dynamic

768
00:33:07,476 --> 00:33:09,796
which really means that

769
00:33:09,796 --> 00:33:12,186
to be reduced to 8 bits

770
00:33:12,186 --> 00:33:15,536
because LDR is an 8 bits per

771
00:33:16,486 --> 00:33:18,976
The good news is we

772
00:33:18,976 --> 00:33:21,356
We automatically do perform

773
00:33:21,746 --> 00:33:24,876
down to 8 bit at build time when

774
00:33:26,186 --> 00:33:29,016
But we preserve the wide gamut

775
00:33:29,016 --> 00:33:32,086
within your original 16 bit

776
00:33:32,466 --> 00:33:35,436
and compressing in the

777
00:33:35,586 --> 00:33:38,676
thus preserving the ability

778
00:33:38,676 --> 00:33:40,326
within the Display P3 gamut.

779
00:33:42,596 --> 00:33:44,346
Okay, so that's the deployment.

780
00:33:44,346 --> 00:33:46,046
A little talk about

781
00:33:46,596 --> 00:33:49,236
but this talk was

782
00:33:49,356 --> 00:33:50,416
Well what about colors?

783
00:33:51,476 --> 00:33:53,076
Specifically colors in UI.

784
00:33:55,296 --> 00:33:58,246
An important observation is

785
00:33:58,246 --> 00:34:00,656
on screen drawn by

786
00:33:58,246 --> 00:34:00,656
on screen drawn by

787
00:34:00,656 --> 00:34:02,336
don't come from images,

788
00:34:02,336 --> 00:34:04,806
to get top billing

789
00:34:05,076 --> 00:34:07,506
Most pixels on screen are

790
00:34:07,506 --> 00:34:09,156
by your code in your

791
00:34:10,416 --> 00:34:13,585
And wide gamut colors it turns

792
00:34:13,585 --> 00:34:16,326
in just working at

793
00:34:16,456 --> 00:34:17,746
So let's talk about that.

794
00:34:18,835 --> 00:34:21,116
In particular, the first

795
00:34:21,116 --> 00:34:22,866
about is actually

796
00:34:22,866 --> 00:34:24,516
because this is an

797
00:34:25,065 --> 00:34:26,315
under-appreciate problem.

798
00:34:27,226 --> 00:34:30,315
Usually when designers

799
00:34:30,315 --> 00:34:32,516
in written form, or

800
00:34:32,815 --> 00:34:35,755
or visual form code is

801
00:34:35,755 --> 00:34:38,136
with an assumed sRGB

802
00:34:38,596 --> 00:34:41,206
That means you're probably

803
00:34:41,206 --> 00:34:44,896
down as something like

804
00:34:45,755 --> 00:34:46,456
You know very simple.

805
00:34:46,456 --> 00:34:47,775
They don't tell you what

806
00:34:48,096 --> 00:34:50,266
And it's just assumed everybody

807
00:34:50,295 --> 00:34:52,416
because everybody's

808
00:34:53,156 --> 00:34:54,426
Well, not anymore.

809
00:34:55,545 --> 00:34:58,896
This is no longer sufficient for

810
00:34:59,586 --> 00:35:00,336
So what do you do?

811
00:34:59,586 --> 00:35:00,336
So what do you do?

812
00:35:00,476 --> 00:35:02,996
Well the most important step

813
00:35:02,996 --> 00:35:05,416
about what color space you're

814
00:35:05,416 --> 00:35:09,056
or write down, or, you

815
00:35:09,236 --> 00:35:13,016
Use Display P3, instead of

816
00:35:13,016 --> 00:35:14,106
on wide gamut designs.

817
00:35:14,646 --> 00:35:15,746
And indicate that as such.

818
00:35:16,306 --> 00:35:18,226
And if you need more

819
00:35:18,226 --> 00:35:21,826
to 255 8-bit representation

820
00:35:21,826 --> 00:35:22,596
and use floating point.

821
00:35:23,086 --> 00:35:26,126
So as an example, next time

822
00:35:26,736 --> 00:35:28,616
maybe you'll refer to them

823
00:35:28,726 --> 00:35:35,456
with an annotation, P3

824
00:35:35,556 --> 00:35:37,506
Okay that's how you communicate

825
00:35:37,506 --> 00:35:39,466
that color come from

826
00:35:39,466 --> 00:35:40,256
You probably picked it,

827
00:35:40,256 --> 00:35:41,596
the designer probably

828
00:35:41,866 --> 00:35:42,516
How do they pick it?

829
00:35:42,846 --> 00:35:45,056
Using a color panel.

830
00:35:45,056 --> 00:35:47,716
This is the standard color panel

831
00:35:47,716 --> 00:35:49,896
it's part of AppKits,

832
00:35:50,136 --> 00:35:56,396
This of course is a very

833
00:35:56,396 --> 00:35:57,956
from some of the

834
00:35:57,956 --> 00:35:58,986
about in calling colors.

835
00:35:58,986 --> 00:36:00,156
Typically, you pick red,

836
00:35:58,986 --> 00:36:00,156
Typically, you pick red,

837
00:36:00,156 --> 00:36:02,256
green and blue values,

838
00:36:02,606 --> 00:36:05,506
The color panel is

839
00:36:05,506 --> 00:36:06,306
in different color spaces,

840
00:36:06,306 --> 00:36:08,376
but that hasn't always

841
00:36:08,376 --> 00:36:09,756
or easy user experience.

842
00:36:10,436 --> 00:36:12,856
So I'm excited to say that we've

843
00:36:12,896 --> 00:36:15,636
in the color panel, in

844
00:36:15,636 --> 00:36:16,866
with wide color a little easier.

845
00:36:17,666 --> 00:36:21,716
The first thing we've done

846
00:36:21,716 --> 00:36:24,756
and important working spaces,

847
00:36:25,046 --> 00:36:28,256
right up there in a

848
00:36:28,256 --> 00:36:32,696
for the number picker, sRGB,

849
00:36:33,056 --> 00:36:35,666
The next thing we've done is

850
00:36:35,666 --> 00:36:38,776
to change the numerical

851
00:36:38,776 --> 00:36:39,966
from integer to floating point.

852
00:36:40,456 --> 00:36:43,886
So that you can standardize

853
00:36:43,886 --> 00:36:45,246
if that works for your workflow.

854
00:36:46,616 --> 00:36:50,516
Another exciting thing we've

855
00:36:50,656 --> 00:36:54,856
or wheel picker, we've actually

856
00:36:54,856 --> 00:36:58,496
so that it can actually render

857
00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:00,866
when placed on an

858
00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:00,866
when placed on an

859
00:37:02,276 --> 00:37:05,516
And we've added a new

860
00:37:05,516 --> 00:37:07,696
to either use this

861
00:37:07,696 --> 00:37:11,346
where it just basically switches

862
00:37:11,346 --> 00:37:13,286
and sRGB as you cross displays,

863
00:37:13,286 --> 00:37:15,266
or pin it to a specific

864
00:37:15,966 --> 00:37:19,436
if that's more what

865
00:37:19,656 --> 00:37:22,786
Okay, now we've picked

866
00:37:22,786 --> 00:37:23,856
we know how to communicate them.

867
00:37:23,856 --> 00:37:25,136
Well, to actually make

868
00:37:25,136 --> 00:37:25,896
to code them don't we?

869
00:37:26,426 --> 00:37:28,686
How do we construct wide

870
00:37:30,056 --> 00:37:33,496
We've introduced two new

871
00:37:33,496 --> 00:37:37,356
in AppKit and UIKit to

872
00:37:37,356 --> 00:37:38,086
numbers directly.

873
00:37:39,036 --> 00:37:41,396
This is NSColor Display P3

874
00:37:41,396 --> 00:37:43,656
and UIColor Display P3

875
00:37:43,936 --> 00:37:45,986
Great way to work with P3

876
00:37:46,266 --> 00:37:49,126
But of course your code

877
00:37:49,126 --> 00:37:52,456
with extended range sRGB

878
00:37:52,456 --> 00:37:54,746
from a designer, but maybe came

879
00:37:55,086 --> 00:37:56,886
or an API that might

880
00:37:56,886 --> 00:37:58,836
you know extended

881
00:37:59,266 --> 00:38:00,326
How do you work with those?

882
00:37:59,266 --> 00:38:00,326
How do you work with those?

883
00:38:00,806 --> 00:38:05,186
Well the good news is we've

884
00:38:05,186 --> 00:38:07,766
red, green, blue alpha

885
00:38:07,766 --> 00:38:11,206
and UIColor color to not

886
00:38:11,206 --> 00:38:13,366
and allow values to

887
00:38:13,366 --> 00:38:14,666
than one and less than zero.

888
00:38:15,026 --> 00:38:17,846
So now you can construct

889
00:38:17,846 --> 00:38:20,406
very easily.

890
00:38:20,596 --> 00:38:23,126
Okay, now storing colors.

891
00:38:24,456 --> 00:38:28,116
What if you actually

892
00:38:28,116 --> 00:38:30,746
into your document data, or

893
00:38:31,186 --> 00:38:34,056
Well special care really needs

894
00:38:34,376 --> 00:38:37,896
because like many other

895
00:38:38,276 --> 00:38:40,236
there has traditionally

896
00:38:40,236 --> 00:38:42,896
of assumed color spaces and

897
00:38:42,896 --> 00:38:44,306
about the same thing

898
00:38:44,306 --> 00:38:45,146
green and blue number.

899
00:38:45,146 --> 00:38:47,426
All you should ever need

900
00:38:47,426 --> 00:38:48,616
That's all you need

901
00:38:48,616 --> 00:38:49,606
What could be wrong with that?

902
00:38:50,136 --> 00:38:51,046
Well it turns out there is.

903
00:38:51,546 --> 00:38:54,786
Because you may not be able to

904
00:38:54,786 --> 00:38:56,826
and a P3 color, and you may

905
00:38:56,826 --> 00:38:59,206
up with the wrong

906
00:38:59,426 --> 00:39:02,206
So I'd like you to

907
00:38:59,426 --> 00:39:02,206
So I'd like you to

908
00:39:02,206 --> 00:39:07,236
encoding a compatible sRGB color

909
00:39:07,236 --> 00:39:10,046
color, which allows

910
00:39:10,046 --> 00:39:12,316
especially older versions

911
00:39:12,316 --> 00:39:13,986
because since this is

912
00:39:13,986 --> 00:39:15,946
and backward compatibility

913
00:39:16,556 --> 00:39:19,946
Allows the older applications to

914
00:39:19,946 --> 00:39:21,446
and treat it as if it was sRGB,

915
00:39:21,446 --> 00:39:22,806
which is the assumption

916
00:39:23,406 --> 00:39:25,196
Whereas the newer

917
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:28,486
about this new wide gamut code

918
00:39:28,806 --> 00:39:31,406
How do you create that

919
00:39:31,406 --> 00:39:34,046
On iOS you can use the

920
00:39:34,966 --> 00:39:36,796
And on the macOS you

921
00:39:36,896 --> 00:39:39,826
NSColor.usingColorSpace

922
00:39:39,826 --> 00:39:41,076
to the sRGB color space.

923
00:39:42,176 --> 00:39:45,686
We actually ran into this in

924
00:39:46,246 --> 00:39:49,246
You may be familiar

925
00:39:49,246 --> 00:39:51,256
And the text editor

926
00:39:51,666 --> 00:39:54,626
And its document format is

927
00:39:54,626 --> 00:39:56,956
which has been around

928
00:39:56,956 --> 00:39:59,586
by the Cocoa Text System as its

929
00:40:00,046 --> 00:40:03,556
And it turns out that when you

930
00:40:03,556 --> 00:40:05,886
a range of text, the way

931
00:40:05,886 --> 00:40:10,316
that in the RTF document was

932
00:40:10,316 --> 00:40:12,856
green, blue, 0 to 55 values.

933
00:40:13,396 --> 00:40:15,776
Which is kind of a problem, I

934
00:40:15,776 --> 00:40:18,106
because we have no idea which

935
00:40:18,106 --> 00:40:19,816
blue values are in, and

936
00:40:19,816 --> 00:40:20,876
to express the full range.

937
00:40:21,686 --> 00:40:23,306
So, we had to take action.

938
00:40:23,566 --> 00:40:27,016
What we ended up doing

939
00:40:27,016 --> 00:40:30,616
and how we write and read

940
00:40:31,216 --> 00:40:34,636
By including an expanded

941
00:40:35,366 --> 00:40:38,066
which actually annotates

942
00:40:38,066 --> 00:40:40,456
which have now been

943
00:40:40,956 --> 00:40:43,616
with individual color space

944
00:40:43,616 --> 00:40:45,726
to specify colors in

945
00:40:46,256 --> 00:40:48,226
Okay. That's great.

946
00:40:48,296 --> 00:40:50,496
But this is California,

947
00:40:50,496 --> 00:40:51,336
to be surfing aren't we?

948
00:40:51,906 --> 00:40:53,876
Well, what does that

949
00:40:53,876 --> 00:40:57,826
Well, there's colors on the web.

950
00:40:58,176 --> 00:41:00,856
The good news with wide

951
00:40:58,176 --> 00:41:00,856
The good news with wide

952
00:41:00,856 --> 00:41:04,176
that as long as your image

953
00:41:04,176 --> 00:41:05,816
and has appropriate color

954
00:41:06,496 --> 00:41:08,726
all of the content

955
00:41:08,726 --> 00:41:10,066
when it's rendered on webpages.

956
00:41:10,486 --> 00:41:12,596
So as long as you do

957
00:41:14,096 --> 00:41:16,326
Also, there are now

958
00:41:16,326 --> 00:41:19,596
to resolve assets between

959
00:41:19,596 --> 00:41:22,136
which is really handy.

960
00:41:22,136 --> 00:41:24,456
And lastly, there's a WebKit

961
00:41:24,756 --> 00:41:28,306
for specifying CSS colors

962
00:41:28,306 --> 00:41:31,016
than the assumed sRGB,

963
00:41:31,016 --> 00:41:32,076
since CSS's inception.

964
00:41:32,776 --> 00:41:35,706
And with that I would like to

965
00:41:35,706 --> 00:41:38,376
who will tell you a little

966
00:41:38,606 --> 00:41:40,236
with wide color in your apps.

967
00:41:40,406 --> 00:41:40,966
Thank you.

968
00:41:41,516 --> 00:41:43,776
[ Applause ]

969
00:41:44,276 --> 00:41:46,446
&gt;&gt; Thank you Patrick.

970
00:41:47,156 --> 00:41:52,356
So, in your applications

971
00:41:52,356 --> 00:41:53,706
that you get from

972
00:41:53,736 --> 00:41:57,346
but also you might get some

973
00:41:57,346 --> 00:42:00,056
or pulled down from the internet

974
00:41:57,346 --> 00:42:00,056
or pulled down from the internet

975
00:42:00,526 --> 00:42:03,456
And maybe you want to

976
00:42:03,706 --> 00:42:05,326
as part of that.

977
00:42:05,456 --> 00:42:07,226
How do you deal with

978
00:42:07,766 --> 00:42:10,806
Well, when you're

979
00:42:10,806 --> 00:42:14,396
I'm going to take a

980
00:42:14,636 --> 00:42:19,936
Now, this is a box where

981
00:42:19,936 --> 00:42:23,696
with the most saturated

982
00:42:23,696 --> 00:42:25,336
And the other half of

983
00:42:25,336 --> 00:42:30,486
with the most saturated

984
00:42:30,576 --> 00:42:34,336
Unfortunately, because

985
00:42:34,536 --> 00:42:36,546
and you're watching it

986
00:42:36,546 --> 00:42:38,916
that doesn't have the

987
00:42:38,916 --> 00:42:41,016
as our new displays

988
00:42:42,386 --> 00:42:44,956
So, we've actually

989
00:42:44,956 --> 00:42:48,906
So what you're seeing isn't

990
00:42:49,076 --> 00:42:52,146
that I'm going to show you

991
00:42:52,146 --> 00:42:53,396
on a device and it

992
00:42:54,556 --> 00:42:58,846
So, I'm a Frameworks Engineer on

993
00:42:59,026 --> 00:43:05,176
so of course I'm going to start

994
00:42:59,026 --> 00:43:05,176
so of course I'm going to start

995
00:43:05,676 --> 00:43:07,276
When you're on the desktop,

996
00:43:07,336 --> 00:43:10,426
it already has some great

997
00:43:10,426 --> 00:43:13,196
for color profiles in your

998
00:43:13,936 --> 00:43:17,316
If you have to do manual drawing

999
00:43:17,316 --> 00:43:19,956
to be done off screen,

1000
00:43:19,956 --> 00:43:24,046
to do this is using the

1001
00:43:25,036 --> 00:43:27,246
It's called with

1002
00:43:28,026 --> 00:43:31,596
And you can use this anywhere

1003
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:32,776
it will just work there.

1004
00:43:33,816 --> 00:43:37,426
So, let's look at some code.

1005
00:43:37,606 --> 00:43:40,656
So, pretty simple,

1006
00:43:41,536 --> 00:43:46,286
and we initialize our

1007
00:43:46,286 --> 00:43:47,466
We don't want this

1008
00:43:48,326 --> 00:43:51,276
And we configure

1009
00:43:53,596 --> 00:43:55,946
We get the Rect from the

1010
00:43:56,456 --> 00:43:57,916
We divide it up in halves,

1011
00:43:58,606 --> 00:44:01,426
allocated displayP3Red

1012
00:43:58,606 --> 00:44:01,426
allocated displayP3Red

1013
00:44:02,606 --> 00:44:05,616
Then allocate our sRGB

1014
00:44:06,526 --> 00:44:09,096
And then return true,

1015
00:44:09,096 --> 00:44:09,926
And we're done.

1016
00:44:10,766 --> 00:44:11,186
There you go.

1017
00:44:12,106 --> 00:44:12,936
It all just works.

1018
00:44:13,486 --> 00:44:15,166
If you're using this in

1019
00:44:15,656 --> 00:44:18,546
you're already doing

1020
00:44:18,736 --> 00:44:21,306
So, that's pretty

1021
00:44:21,906 --> 00:44:22,876
What about iOS?

1022
00:44:23,396 --> 00:44:24,496
Should be just as simple right?

1023
00:44:26,036 --> 00:44:31,026
So you must all be familiar with

1024
00:44:31,836 --> 00:44:34,726
It's a nice little API.

1025
00:44:34,956 --> 00:44:36,586
And, let's see the code again.

1026
00:44:37,176 --> 00:44:39,876
We get the size, we made

1027
00:44:41,066 --> 00:44:46,716
We divide our Rects, draw our

1028
00:44:47,666 --> 00:44:51,166
We get our image and

1029
00:44:51,166 --> 00:44:53,546
And this is what we get out.

1030
00:44:54,436 --> 00:44:58,266
That's not correct.

1031
00:44:58,426 --> 00:44:59,686
Why didn't this work?

1032
00:45:00,246 --> 00:45:03,266
Well, if we look

1033
00:45:03,266 --> 00:45:08,256
at the documentation we

1034
00:45:08,256 --> 00:45:11,956
We've documented that

1035
00:45:12,166 --> 00:45:15,456
in the UIKit will only

1036
00:45:15,456 --> 00:45:16,446
integer context.

1037
00:45:16,746 --> 00:45:20,526
That means you only get 8 bits

1038
00:45:20,526 --> 00:45:21,516
green, blue, and alpha.

1039
00:45:23,376 --> 00:45:28,086
This has a pretty big impact

1040
00:45:29,466 --> 00:45:31,476
Since we can't create

1041
00:45:31,476 --> 00:45:37,486
than 8 bits per color channel,

1042
00:45:37,486 --> 00:45:41,116
in the extended sRGB

1043
00:45:41,116 --> 00:45:44,306
And, because of the existing

1044
00:45:44,636 --> 00:45:48,706
well we can't expand

1045
00:45:48,826 --> 00:45:51,846
And we didn't want to make

1046
00:45:51,846 --> 00:45:52,826
with more options.

1047
00:45:53,956 --> 00:45:57,666
So, we have some new

1048
00:45:58,486 --> 00:46:00,476
It's called

1049
00:45:58,486 --> 00:46:00,476
It's called

1050
00:46:01,056 --> 00:46:04,136
And the way this works is

1051
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:07,606
So I'm just going to jump

1052
00:46:07,786 --> 00:46:08,256
Here we are.

1053
00:46:08,396 --> 00:46:11,096
First we instantiate our

1054
00:46:11,476 --> 00:46:12,506
You can reuse this.

1055
00:46:12,746 --> 00:46:14,506
And it retains the

1056
00:46:14,506 --> 00:46:17,246
across every implication

1057
00:46:17,246 --> 00:46:18,276
out with the drawing handler.

1058
00:46:18,776 --> 00:46:22,856
And you just call

1059
00:46:23,086 --> 00:46:26,356
You supply your block,

1060
00:46:27,116 --> 00:46:29,786
as you would otherwise.

1061
00:46:30,616 --> 00:46:32,696
The bounds you can

1062
00:46:32,696 --> 00:46:35,046
which describes the

1063
00:46:35,046 --> 00:46:36,996
that this particular

1064
00:46:37,756 --> 00:46:39,126
And then you just

1065
00:46:40,756 --> 00:46:43,576
You get and render

1066
00:46:44,576 --> 00:46:48,136
And then you configure and

1067
00:46:48,786 --> 00:46:50,456
and just like we had

1068
00:46:51,166 --> 00:46:55,356
we have a correctly rendered

1069
00:46:55,616 --> 00:46:57,716
half sRGB red square.

1070
00:46:59,396 --> 00:47:01,666
So just a few other

1071
00:46:59,396 --> 00:47:01,666
So just a few other

1072
00:47:02,876 --> 00:47:04,966
It is fully color

1073
00:47:06,216 --> 00:47:10,216
And it also supports the

1074
00:47:10,216 --> 00:47:10,716
by default.

1075
00:47:11,966 --> 00:47:14,146
And it's pretty smart

1076
00:47:14,376 --> 00:47:17,356
If you have a device

1077
00:47:18,016 --> 00:47:20,156
like the new iPad Pro 9.7 inch,

1078
00:47:20,656 --> 00:47:21,856
we'll just turn it

1079
00:47:22,216 --> 00:47:23,766
You don't need to do

1080
00:47:23,766 --> 00:47:25,436
But if you're on a device

1081
00:47:25,436 --> 00:47:27,276
that does not have the

1082
00:47:27,276 --> 00:47:31,066
like every other iPad and

1083
00:47:31,066 --> 00:47:33,726
to get the more standard

1084
00:47:34,156 --> 00:47:36,936
sRGB context to draw into.

1085
00:47:37,776 --> 00:47:39,536
So we don't waste

1086
00:47:39,836 --> 00:47:41,746
for having the 16

1087
00:47:42,436 --> 00:47:43,696
The other thing this does

1088
00:47:43,696 --> 00:47:46,536
for you is it manages

1089
00:47:47,136 --> 00:47:49,346
You don't need to worry

1090
00:47:49,646 --> 00:47:52,726
or any other management

1091
00:47:53,276 --> 00:47:57,426
And for any legacy code that

1092
00:47:57,976 --> 00:48:00,446
it works with

1093
00:47:57,976 --> 00:48:00,446
it works with

1094
00:48:00,856 --> 00:48:03,046
So if you call into some

1095
00:48:03,716 --> 00:48:06,716
you'll do the right thing.

1096
00:48:06,936 --> 00:48:09,546
So, that's rendering

1097
00:48:10,106 --> 00:48:11,176
What about to the screen?

1098
00:48:12,516 --> 00:48:15,556
Okay we'll start

1099
00:48:15,556 --> 00:48:18,116
On [inaudible] view we

1100
00:48:18,436 --> 00:48:20,516
newly named in Swift 3, Draw.

1101
00:48:20,916 --> 00:48:23,246
And we do the right

1102
00:48:24,086 --> 00:48:27,736
When you call draw in

1103
00:48:28,526 --> 00:48:34,346
if you are on an iPad 9.7 inch,

1104
00:48:34,446 --> 00:48:38,026
in the correct, extended

1105
00:48:38,026 --> 00:48:40,056
with the floating

1106
00:48:41,236 --> 00:48:44,566
And if you're not on one

1107
00:48:45,386 --> 00:48:48,916
well you get what you get

1108
00:48:48,916 --> 00:48:53,986
And of course if you have

1109
00:48:54,646 --> 00:48:58,366
which has been color managed

1110
00:48:58,366 --> 00:49:02,686
to be color managed today.

1111
00:48:58,366 --> 00:49:02,686
to be color managed today.

1112
00:49:02,866 --> 00:49:06,386
If you need to know how

1113
00:49:06,386 --> 00:49:09,126
at a new trait on

1114
00:49:09,126 --> 00:49:11,446
in view controllers

1115
00:49:12,036 --> 00:49:17,846
It takes a UI display gamut

1116
00:49:17,846 --> 00:49:22,436
if you're on a new, P3 class

1117
00:49:22,436 --> 00:49:23,856
on a new sRGB class display.

1118
00:49:23,856 --> 00:49:26,686
And this can be very useful

1119
00:49:26,686 --> 00:49:31,096
to match a particular UI

1120
00:49:31,096 --> 00:49:32,186
from your asset catalog.

1121
00:49:32,186 --> 00:49:38,146
So you can properly match

1122
00:49:38,326 --> 00:49:43,296
Now, what if you know

1123
00:49:43,296 --> 00:49:45,436
to need the extended

1124
00:49:46,786 --> 00:49:49,636
Well, there's a new

1125
00:49:51,136 --> 00:49:52,806
and that is contents format.

1126
00:49:53,226 --> 00:49:58,566
And this controls exactly how

1127
00:49:58,566 --> 00:50:01,216
for you when it renders

1128
00:49:58,566 --> 00:50:01,216
for you when it renders

1129
00:50:02,046 --> 00:50:04,926
By default, on the

1130
00:50:06,076 --> 00:50:08,766
it is to use the

1131
00:50:08,976 --> 00:50:10,636
And on all of the

1132
00:50:10,636 --> 00:50:13,516
to use the traditional,

1133
00:50:14,406 --> 00:50:16,056
And you control it with any one

1134
00:50:16,056 --> 00:50:18,076
of these various

1135
00:50:19,536 --> 00:50:22,686
So on Cocoa, back

1136
00:50:23,696 --> 00:50:26,966
NSView, same thing as UIView.

1137
00:50:27,206 --> 00:50:30,586
It will draw with the current

1138
00:50:31,456 --> 00:50:36,216
And you can look at any of the

1139
00:50:36,496 --> 00:50:38,806
with the Window Backing Store,

1140
00:50:38,806 --> 00:50:40,606
the screen target

1141
00:50:41,836 --> 00:50:43,276
If the window changes displays,

1142
00:50:44,136 --> 00:50:45,496
then you get the

1143
00:50:45,496 --> 00:50:47,106
in properties callback

1144
00:50:47,696 --> 00:50:50,826
And you can also listen

1145
00:50:50,826 --> 00:50:54,086
BackingPropertiesNotification,

1146
00:50:54,086 --> 00:50:55,136
from your view's window.

1147
00:50:55,816 --> 00:50:57,846
These are the same that

1148
00:50:57,846 --> 00:51:02,376
with since a very long time now.

1149
00:50:57,846 --> 00:51:02,376
with since a very long time now.

1150
00:51:02,376 --> 00:51:03,646
And just as a refresher.

1151
00:51:04,466 --> 00:51:05,416
The backing properties

1152
00:51:05,416 --> 00:51:12,286
on the NSWindow include the

1153
00:51:12,626 --> 00:51:14,246
and the output display gamut.

1154
00:51:14,856 --> 00:51:19,816
And just like in iOS, you

1155
00:51:19,816 --> 00:51:26,896
of a context you get in AppKit,

1156
00:51:26,896 --> 00:51:29,866
on NSWindow, and you

1157
00:51:29,866 --> 00:51:31,216
of these depth properties.

1158
00:51:31,216 --> 00:51:35,736
So if you are on a wide

1159
00:51:35,736 --> 00:51:40,366
that extra precision you can

1160
00:51:40,366 --> 00:51:43,766
and it will not create the

1161
00:51:44,946 --> 00:51:47,096
So, what did we learn today?

1162
00:51:48,246 --> 00:51:53,766
Well, you've seen our vision

1163
00:51:53,766 --> 00:51:56,566
that to the next generation

1164
00:51:58,016 --> 00:51:59,356
We've talked a little

1165
00:51:59,356 --> 00:52:02,546
and color management,

1166
00:51:59,356 --> 00:52:02,546
and color management,

1167
00:52:02,546 --> 00:52:04,506
with that wide gamut

1168
00:52:04,506 --> 00:52:05,606
to bring to your users.

1169
00:52:06,116 --> 00:52:10,386
We've reviewed how to use

1170
00:52:10,926 --> 00:52:15,656
And how to take your drawing

1171
00:52:17,016 --> 00:52:19,936
by making sure that

1172
00:52:19,936 --> 00:52:21,376
in these wide gamut scenarios.

1173
00:52:22,676 --> 00:52:26,866
Now for more information you can

1174
00:52:27,086 --> 00:52:29,166
on the session's website.

1175
00:52:30,076 --> 00:52:33,216
And there are a large

1176
00:52:34,406 --> 00:52:35,316
This is page 1.

1177
00:52:35,896 --> 00:52:38,866
So please check them out.

1178
00:52:38,866 --> 00:52:40,376
If they've already

1179
00:52:40,376 --> 00:52:43,506
to enumerate them,

1180
00:52:43,506 --> 00:52:45,986
See the videos through

1181
00:52:45,986 --> 00:52:47,836
or online at the WWDC website.

1182
00:52:48,466 --> 00:52:48,966
Thank you.
