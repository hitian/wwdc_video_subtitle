&gt;&gt; Hello, everyone.

4
00:00:37,006 --> 00:00:38,326
And welcome to What's

5
00:00:39,036 --> 00:00:40,836
I'm Ross. I'm an engineer here

6
00:00:40,836 --> 00:00:42,386
in the Games Technology

7
00:00:42,386 --> 00:00:43,836
And I'm really excited

8
00:00:43,836 --> 00:00:50,066
to show you what we've been

9
00:00:50,696 --> 00:00:52,516
Before we jump into talking

10
00:00:52,516 --> 00:00:54,496
about the new features

11
00:00:54,746 --> 00:00:57,016
I'd like to take a moment to

12
00:00:57,016 --> 00:00:59,736
for anyone who may not

13
00:01:01,086 --> 00:01:04,096
So, SpriteKit is our 2D

14
00:01:04,786 --> 00:01:07,356
It's designed to be highly

15
00:01:07,356 --> 00:01:10,196
to use while still

16
00:01:10,256 --> 00:01:12,636
So, there are as few barriers

17
00:01:12,636 --> 00:01:14,196
and the great games

18
00:01:15,726 --> 00:01:19,586
It's supported across all of our

19
00:01:19,956 --> 00:01:22,206
tvOS and this year

20
00:01:22,206 --> 00:01:24,236
that is available

21
00:01:25,876 --> 00:01:27,826

without needing to be

26
00:01:37,456 --> 00:01:38,486
so you're always up-to-date.

27
00:01:38,716 --> 00:01:41,706
And it's naturally integrated

28
00:01:41,956 --> 00:01:44,106
all these great features,

29
00:01:45,486 --> 00:01:48,636
But the framework is only

30
00:01:49,396 --> 00:01:52,126
The other half is our Xcode

31
00:01:52,246 --> 00:01:55,086
which lets you preview your

32
00:01:55,086 --> 00:01:56,686
and lay them out visually.

33
00:01:57,786 --> 00:02:00,176

to bring life to

with our robust particle editor.

37
00:02:04,636 --> 00:02:06,316
It's fully integrated

38
00:02:06,316 --> 00:02:09,006
so you can leverage

39
00:02:09,256 --> 00:02:10,735
and on-demand resources

40
00:02:10,735 --> 00:02:11,686
to jump through any hoops.

41
00:02:12,056 --> 00:02:14,226
And this year we're

42
00:02:14,226 --> 00:02:16,276
and GameplayKit integration,

43
00:02:16,276 --> 00:02:17,136
about a little later on.

44
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:21,826
And finally, SpriteKit is fully

45
00:02:21,826 --> 00:02:24,266
that support it,

46
00:02:24,266 --> 00:02:26,346
to its great performance

47
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:27,496
without having to do anything.

48
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:32,156
So, this year we're continuing

49
00:02:32,156 --> 00:02:33,336
that make it easier

50
00:02:33,336 --> 00:02:35,496
to make great games

51
00:02:35,746 --> 00:02:39,686
So, without further ado,

52
00:02:40,066 --> 00:02:41,916
Now, normally with

53
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:43,666
we'd put the tools

54
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:45,506
But today we're going to turn

55
00:02:45,506 --> 00:02:48,486
And that's because the

56
00:02:48,486 --> 00:02:50,346
to getting the most

57
00:02:50,856 --> 00:02:52,786
And this year we've got some

58
00:02:52,786 --> 00:02:55,586
So, let's start with

59
00:02:57,216 --> 00:02:59,376
Knowing what's in your

60
00:02:59,376 --> 00:03:01,146
to one another is

61
00:02:59,376 --> 00:03:01,146
to one another is

62
00:03:01,146 --> 00:03:02,276
for effective scene management.

63
00:03:03,456 --> 00:03:04,926
In Xcode 7, this

64
00:03:04,926 --> 00:03:05,626
through the Jump Bar.

65
00:03:06,566 --> 00:03:09,146
The Jump Bar is designed to

66
00:03:09,146 --> 00:03:11,506
in your workspace easier but

67
00:03:11,876 --> 00:03:14,206
it also has all the

68
00:03:14,616 --> 00:03:17,246
And this is great for

69
00:03:17,306 --> 00:03:19,506
but it would be nice if we

70
00:03:19,506 --> 00:03:20,486
at the same time.

71
00:03:21,796 --> 00:03:25,976
So, now in Xcode 8 you can,

72
00:03:26,876 --> 00:03:28,726
It's a new panel that allows

73
00:03:28,726 --> 00:03:30,186
in your scene and

74
00:03:30,186 --> 00:03:32,106
relationship simultaneously.

75
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:34,776
In addition to being

76
00:03:34,776 --> 00:03:38,156
you can also rename them and

77
00:03:38,156 --> 00:03:41,776
You can also change their

78
00:03:41,776 --> 00:03:43,906
of the nodes by dragging

79
00:03:43,936 --> 00:03:47,406
much like you reorder

80
00:03:49,536 --> 00:03:52,276
Drag a child onto another

81
00:03:52,806 --> 00:03:54,986
drag a node onto another node

82
00:03:55,546 --> 00:03:57,376
or drag a child out

83
00:03:57,586 --> 00:03:58,546
to break that relationship.

84
00:03:59,006 --> 00:04:02,996
We also have the ability

85
00:03:59,006 --> 00:04:02,996
We also have the ability

86
00:04:03,856 --> 00:04:07,036
Locked nodes can't be modified

87
00:04:07,036 --> 00:04:09,766
And that can make navigating

88
00:04:09,766 --> 00:04:12,996
when you have a lot of notes and

89
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,616
And the same with hiding.

90
00:04:14,616 --> 00:04:17,495
It's great for when you

91
00:04:17,815 --> 00:04:20,356
and you want to access some

92
00:04:21,466 --> 00:04:24,226
So, all these features make the

93
00:04:24,226 --> 00:04:27,266
and it's making, makes managing

94
00:04:27,596 --> 00:04:31,366
So, next I'd like to talk a

95
00:04:31,366 --> 00:04:33,696
to integrate the GameplayKit

96
00:04:35,236 --> 00:04:36,676
So, last year we

97
00:04:37,286 --> 00:04:39,746
a brand-new framework that

98
00:04:39,836 --> 00:04:42,176
for problems that are commonly

99
00:04:43,286 --> 00:04:46,396
One of the features included

100
00:04:46,396 --> 00:04:48,666
and components, which is a

101
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:50,436
on modularity and reusability.

102
00:04:51,456 --> 00:04:55,956
Components encapsulate behavior

103
00:04:55,956 --> 00:05:01,096
or entities to change

104
00:04:55,956 --> 00:05:01,096
or entities to change

105
00:05:01,726 --> 00:05:04,926
And you do this without

106
00:05:04,926 --> 00:05:06,366
for every object in your scene.

107
00:05:06,856 --> 00:05:09,246
Now, we're not going

108
00:05:09,246 --> 00:05:12,906
about how these work but it's

109
00:05:13,016 --> 00:05:16,256
as code building blocks that

110
00:05:16,256 --> 00:05:18,296
to create objects that

111
00:05:18,536 --> 00:05:23,106
Typically, you might have a

112
00:05:23,106 --> 00:05:24,676
for objects that can be damaged.

113
00:05:25,476 --> 00:05:28,336
Or a component that has

114
00:05:28,336 --> 00:05:29,416
that can collide

115
00:05:30,016 --> 00:05:32,416
Or a component that

116
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:33,936
to be a player controlled

117
00:05:33,936 --> 00:05:39,206
Components are really

118
00:05:39,206 --> 00:05:41,606
to control how your

119
00:05:42,356 --> 00:05:46,006
And now we're bringing

120
00:05:46,116 --> 00:05:47,226
into the SpriteKit editor.

121
00:05:48,296 --> 00:05:51,536
You can assign components that

122
00:05:51,536 --> 00:05:53,776
from within your scene

123
00:05:53,776 --> 00:05:55,336
and components panel

124
00:05:56,506 --> 00:05:58,356
Additionally, you can

125
00:05:58,356 --> 00:05:59,726
on the custom components

126
00:06:00,406 --> 00:06:02,086
and those will then

127
00:06:02,086 --> 00:06:03,506
and you can tweak

128
00:06:05,076 --> 00:06:06,206
The best part about all this is

129
00:06:06,206 --> 00:06:08,426
if you're already using

130
00:06:08,426 --> 00:06:10,596
and components, we're now

131
00:06:10,596 --> 00:06:12,756
and you can do all of your

132
00:06:12,756 --> 00:06:15,476
from the editor.

133
00:06:16,176 --> 00:06:16,726
Another great feature

134
00:06:16,726 --> 00:06:19,006
that GameplayKit

135
00:06:19,656 --> 00:06:22,686
Pathfinding is all about finding

136
00:06:22,686 --> 00:06:25,066
to point B and it does this

137
00:06:25,066 --> 00:06:27,186
by operating what's

138
00:06:28,696 --> 00:06:30,376
Navigation graphs

139
00:06:30,376 --> 00:06:33,336
of nodes joined together

140
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:37,946
And they describe how an object

141
00:06:38,286 --> 00:06:39,716
without colliding

142
00:06:39,936 --> 00:06:43,596
And now we've integrated

143
00:06:43,676 --> 00:06:44,746
into the SpriteKit editor.

144
00:06:45,206 --> 00:06:47,796
So, you can create and edit

145
00:06:48,596 --> 00:06:50,556
You can add and remove

146
00:06:50,556 --> 00:06:52,276
and make connections

147
00:06:52,276 --> 00:06:53,376
by clicking in the editor.

148
00:06:53,856 --> 00:06:56,626
And you can leverage the

149
00:06:57,776 --> 00:06:59,296
Creating the graph this

150
00:06:59,296 --> 00:07:01,926
and easily define how entities

151
00:06:59,296 --> 00:07:01,926
and easily define how entities

152
00:07:01,926 --> 00:07:03,386
making pathfinding a breeze.

153
00:07:03,386 --> 00:07:07,426
So, now let's talk a little bit

154
00:07:07,466 --> 00:07:09,776
yeah I know, it's

155
00:07:10,516 --> 00:07:12,766
[ Applause ]

156
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:14,526
Now to talk a little

157
00:07:14,526 --> 00:07:15,986
that helps you get the most

158
00:07:15,986 --> 00:07:19,616
of your game, the FPS

159
00:07:19,896 --> 00:07:22,036
You may have used the

160
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:24,656
As you're running your App,

161
00:07:24,656 --> 00:07:26,346
of real-time performance

162
00:07:26,406 --> 00:07:31,236
including your frame

163
00:07:33,136 --> 00:07:34,586
and CPU/GPU frame time.

164
00:07:35,116 --> 00:07:37,466
And this is really helpful

165
00:07:37,556 --> 00:07:43,726
but further granularity

166
00:07:43,956 --> 00:07:47,236
Now in Xcode 8, you get,

167
00:07:47,316 --> 00:07:49,696
of your SpriteKit apps time,

168
00:07:49,766 --> 00:07:51,696
frame time for both

169
00:07:52,616 --> 00:07:55,346
Additionally, it breaks down

170
00:07:55,346 --> 00:07:57,106
to see how much time is

171
00:07:57,546 --> 00:08:00,326
running the update loop,

172
00:07:57,546 --> 00:08:00,326
running the update loop,

173
00:08:00,326 --> 00:08:01,816
of physics and idle time.

174
00:08:02,306 --> 00:08:05,506
This information can be

175
00:08:05,506 --> 00:08:07,836
where you need to focus your

176
00:08:08,876 --> 00:08:10,336
The FPS performance

177
00:08:10,336 --> 00:08:13,936
to help you improve your

178
00:08:14,146 --> 00:08:17,596
It's available for use with

179
00:08:20,036 --> 00:08:23,136
So, we've covered some great

180
00:08:23,136 --> 00:08:25,456
and now I'd like to change

181
00:08:25,456 --> 00:08:27,516
about a new feature that's

182
00:08:27,516 --> 00:08:30,036
and the framework, tile maps.

183
00:08:30,836 --> 00:08:32,785
So, for anyone who

184
00:08:32,785 --> 00:08:35,285
with what tile maps are,

185
00:08:35,285 --> 00:08:36,746
of evenly spaced images.

186
00:08:37,816 --> 00:08:39,736
And they're great for piecing

187
00:08:39,736 --> 00:08:42,466
of small, repeating

188
00:08:44,206 --> 00:08:46,946
Think of tiles as, tile

189
00:08:47,356 --> 00:08:49,156
and tiles as the pieces.

190
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:52,656
Individually they don't look

191
00:08:52,656 --> 00:08:55,556
and you can easily create

192
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:58,996
So, before we get into the

193
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:01,616
let's talk a little bit about

194
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:01,616
let's talk a little bit about

195
00:09:02,846 --> 00:09:05,036
Building scenes from small

196
00:09:05,036 --> 00:09:06,016
common when creating games.

197
00:09:06,326 --> 00:09:09,716
And without tile maps,

198
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:13,676
you'd have to manually place

199
00:09:15,956 --> 00:09:17,316
And this totally works.

200
00:09:18,276 --> 00:09:20,566
And using a set of

201
00:09:20,566 --> 00:09:21,996
for keeping memory overhead low.

202
00:09:22,966 --> 00:09:24,666
They can also be rearranged

203
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:25,746
to how the scene looks.

204
00:09:26,446 --> 00:09:27,976
However, copy pasting

205
00:09:27,976 --> 00:09:31,266
and manually aligning each

206
00:09:31,336 --> 00:09:32,566
tedious and time-consuming.

207
00:09:33,436 --> 00:09:36,046
It can also cause your scene to

208
00:09:36,136 --> 00:09:38,396
which quickly makes things

209
00:09:39,856 --> 00:09:42,566
So instead you could use large,

210
00:09:42,626 --> 00:09:45,776
more detailed images

211
00:09:46,136 --> 00:09:47,486
A sample game released

212
00:09:47,646 --> 00:09:48,896
DemoBots, used this approach.

213
00:09:49,726 --> 00:09:50,936
So, let's say one large image

214
00:09:50,936 --> 00:09:52,456
in your scene is

215
00:09:52,596 --> 00:09:56,306
and that definitely keeps

216
00:09:56,306 --> 00:09:58,216
But if you want to

217
00:09:58,396 --> 00:10:00,846
you need to make modifications

218
00:09:58,396 --> 00:10:00,846
you need to make modifications

219
00:10:01,956 --> 00:10:04,126
Plus, large images

220
00:10:04,126 --> 00:10:06,406
and if you want more

221
00:10:06,746 --> 00:10:08,826
you'll need additional

222
00:10:08,966 --> 00:10:11,446
which in turn further

223
00:10:12,896 --> 00:10:16,036
So, tile maps gives you the

224
00:10:16,726 --> 00:10:19,246
They're easy to manage, as each

225
00:10:19,246 --> 00:10:19,896
in your scene.

226
00:10:20,526 --> 00:10:21,726
They can be quickly modified.

227
00:10:22,256 --> 00:10:23,126
Say for instance I want

228
00:10:23,126 --> 00:10:26,876
to change the sand

229
00:10:27,336 --> 00:10:28,616
All I have to do is

230
00:10:28,616 --> 00:10:30,716
to change the type

231
00:10:31,976 --> 00:10:34,646
And by using a set of smaller

232
00:10:34,856 --> 00:10:38,306
to have large, detailed scenes

233
00:10:39,046 --> 00:10:41,776
Tile maps are also

234
00:10:41,776 --> 00:10:43,006
of different games

235
00:10:43,606 --> 00:10:46,406
You can use them

236
00:10:46,866 --> 00:10:50,326
side scrolling platformers,

237
00:10:51,606 --> 00:10:52,836
hex-based board games.

238
00:10:53,176 --> 00:10:55,096
Tile maps are incredibly

239
00:10:56,926 --> 00:10:59,846
So, as you've seen, tile maps

240
00:10:59,846 --> 00:11:02,026
of just telling you that how

241
00:10:59,846 --> 00:11:02,026
of just telling you that how

242
00:11:02,026 --> 00:11:03,246
into a demo so I can show you.

243
00:11:03,606 --> 00:11:05,296
So, here we are in

244
00:11:05,746 --> 00:11:08,066
and we've already got a

245
00:11:08,466 --> 00:11:10,896
So, let's go ahead

246
00:11:11,196 --> 00:11:14,486
And so the quickest way to start

247
00:11:14,486 --> 00:11:15,216
double-click on it.

248
00:11:15,536 --> 00:11:19,026
And that brings up our

249
00:11:19,026 --> 00:11:19,956
at the top of the screen here.

250
00:11:21,156 --> 00:11:25,066
And by default, we have

251
00:11:25,566 --> 00:11:27,496
which allows us to

252
00:11:27,706 --> 00:11:30,866
And so the paint, all we

253
00:11:31,046 --> 00:11:35,166
and we start placing

254
00:11:36,316 --> 00:11:39,066
If you want to change what type

255
00:11:39,726 --> 00:11:43,686
all we have to do is click on

256
00:11:43,686 --> 00:11:46,236
and that shows us all the

257
00:11:46,236 --> 00:11:46,876
for placement.

258
00:11:47,886 --> 00:11:53,566
So, here let's place edge

259
00:11:53,636 --> 00:11:56,626
and a couple more edge tiles.

260
00:11:56,626 --> 00:11:58,886
And we can see how

261
00:11:59,046 --> 00:12:00,936
piece together your

262
00:11:59,046 --> 00:12:00,936
piece together your

263
00:12:01,806 --> 00:12:04,306
But individually placing

264
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:05,456
bit tedious.

265
00:12:05,626 --> 00:12:08,366
So, I'm going to show you

266
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:10,846
So, here we're just going

267
00:12:10,846 --> 00:12:14,146
to a place a new tile

268
00:12:19,956 --> 00:12:23,286
And by default on our tile

269
00:12:24,756 --> 00:12:27,816
in the inspector enabled

270
00:12:28,316 --> 00:12:33,916
And what this does is when I

271
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:36,706
to select my tiles, you'll see

272
00:12:36,706 --> 00:12:40,416
for placement, we now have these

273
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:43,046
into different types of terrain,

274
00:12:43,226 --> 00:12:44,816
So, I'll go ahead

275
00:12:45,156 --> 00:12:48,226
And now when we go to place

276
00:12:48,796 --> 00:12:50,806
and place the center

277
00:12:50,806 --> 00:12:52,466
to all the edge tiles

278
00:12:52,756 --> 00:12:55,426
And this is really

279
00:12:55,426 --> 00:12:56,926
and easily creating your scenes.

280
00:12:57,056 --> 00:12:59,706
Now, instead of having to

281
00:12:59,706 --> 00:13:02,696
and corner tile, we can just

282
00:12:59,706 --> 00:13:02,696
and corner tile, we can just

283
00:13:02,696 --> 00:13:05,806
up each of the tiles that we

284
00:13:05,806 --> 00:13:08,846
to go through any extra

285
00:13:08,846 --> 00:13:11,166
That makes painting

286
00:13:12,516 --> 00:13:17,356
[ Applause ]

287
00:13:17,856 --> 00:13:20,686
So, let's take a look at how

288
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:24,296
So, the tile sets arrive

289
00:13:24,366 --> 00:13:27,876
And as you see here, you can

290
00:13:27,876 --> 00:13:29,816
that we have, like grass,

291
00:13:30,466 --> 00:13:33,836
And you can see that

292
00:13:33,836 --> 00:13:35,636
so that you can see how they're

293
00:13:35,636 --> 00:13:39,176
So, let's put a new

294
00:13:41,876 --> 00:13:45,976
So, all we have to do to set

295
00:13:45,976 --> 00:13:48,846
with our automapping is to

296
00:13:48,846 --> 00:13:50,396
into their corresponding

297
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:52,276
You can see that we

298
00:13:52,276 --> 00:13:54,006
that vaguely what the tile's

299
00:13:54,786 --> 00:13:59,706
So, we'll just grab some tiles

300
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:04,736
And we just drag-and-drop

301
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:04,736
And we just drag-and-drop

302
00:14:04,736 --> 00:14:07,956
and super easy to set

303
00:14:17,426 --> 00:14:19,456
So there. Let's give it a name.

304
00:14:21,536 --> 00:14:22,896
We'll call this one garden.

305
00:14:24,636 --> 00:14:25,646
And that's it.

306
00:14:26,606 --> 00:14:27,966
So now we can go into a scene.

307
00:14:29,046 --> 00:14:30,216
We'll create a tile map here.

308
00:14:31,956 --> 00:14:33,706
We'll start editing it.

309
00:14:34,576 --> 00:14:37,956
And you'll see our garden

310
00:14:38,346 --> 00:14:40,586
So, I just grab that

311
00:14:40,586 --> 00:14:43,336
And you can see how easy it is

312
00:14:43,586 --> 00:14:45,246
that already works

313
00:14:45,536 --> 00:14:46,666
You don't have to

314
00:14:46,776 --> 00:14:49,006
But there's a little

315
00:14:49,006 --> 00:14:50,126
with the tile groups as well.

316
00:14:50,126 --> 00:14:54,656
So, I'll go back to our tile,

317
00:14:54,656 --> 00:14:55,726
that I premade over here.

318
00:14:55,726 --> 00:14:58,186
And at first glance

319
00:14:58,896 --> 00:15:02,436
But then when I start clicking

320
00:14:58,896 --> 00:15:02,436
But then when I start clicking

321
00:15:02,436 --> 00:15:04,186
you can see that we have a bunch

322
00:15:04,186 --> 00:15:05,706
of variants available

323
00:15:05,806 --> 00:15:11,146
And this is the same for each

324
00:15:13,446 --> 00:15:15,676
So, when we paint this

325
00:15:16,276 --> 00:15:19,106
it will randomly select one of

326
00:15:19,446 --> 00:15:21,526
So, you can have a lot more

327
00:15:21,776 --> 00:15:24,396
Additionally, you can

328
00:15:24,396 --> 00:15:26,596
of the styles, these variants.

329
00:15:27,056 --> 00:15:28,986
See here, the red

330
00:15:28,986 --> 00:15:31,456
have a placement weight of 3.

331
00:15:33,586 --> 00:15:36,026
White flowers have a

332
00:15:36,476 --> 00:15:41,056
And the blue have a

333
00:15:42,536 --> 00:15:44,036
So, the red flowers

334
00:15:44,036 --> 00:15:47,046
than the white flowers and more

335
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:48,996
So, now let's go

336
00:15:49,556 --> 00:15:52,486
We'll create another tile map

337
00:15:54,716 --> 00:15:57,246
and we'll assign our

338
00:16:00,146 --> 00:16:02,886
Now, when we start

339
00:16:03,216 --> 00:16:06,066
you can see our variants

340
00:16:07,556 --> 00:16:10,236
So, you can see the tiles sets

341
00:16:10,236 --> 00:16:13,326
to achieve a lot of different

342
00:16:13,326 --> 00:16:14,566
of work which is super useful.

343
00:16:15,966 --> 00:16:19,476
So, another thing we can do with

344
00:16:20,236 --> 00:16:22,486
So, here in the tile

345
00:16:22,486 --> 00:16:25,076
it appears as if there's

346
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:28,926
But if I grab it here,

347
00:16:29,556 --> 00:16:32,446
you'll see that's actually 2

348
00:16:32,576 --> 00:16:39,586
And so you see we can layer

349
00:16:39,586 --> 00:16:40,376
to make it make it appear

350
00:16:40,376 --> 00:16:44,366
as if we have more

351
00:16:44,366 --> 00:16:45,126
than we actually have.

352
00:16:45,206 --> 00:16:48,316
So, it looks like these

353
00:16:48,366 --> 00:16:51,696
to transition to

354
00:16:51,696 --> 00:16:54,066
So, they actually have

355
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:55,886
So, when we move

356
00:16:57,086 --> 00:17:01,076
they just naturally

357
00:16:57,086 --> 00:17:01,076
they just naturally

358
00:17:01,456 --> 00:17:03,486
And so we move it on

359
00:17:04,006 --> 00:17:04,986
to achieve the same effect.

360
00:17:05,226 --> 00:17:08,996
Now looks as if they're

361
00:17:09,766 --> 00:17:11,685
So, this allows you to

362
00:17:11,685 --> 00:17:13,116
out of your art assets.

363
00:17:13,116 --> 00:17:15,796
If you just have them

364
00:17:15,796 --> 00:17:18,036
on the edges, you can

365
00:17:18,776 --> 00:17:20,516
any way you can conceive

366
00:17:20,516 --> 00:17:23,986
to get a lot more flexibility

367
00:17:25,205 --> 00:17:26,435
So, another thing that we can do

368
00:17:26,435 --> 00:17:29,886
with our tile sets is

369
00:17:30,856 --> 00:17:34,426
So, here we have a nice tile set

370
00:17:34,686 --> 00:17:35,796
We'll press the animate button

371
00:17:36,546 --> 00:17:40,436
and if you look closely

372
00:17:40,436 --> 00:17:43,076
on the water tiles

373
00:17:43,076 --> 00:17:48,806
So, now let's take a look at the

374
00:17:50,366 --> 00:17:51,546
Set the water.

375
00:17:51,986 --> 00:17:53,736
You can see, preview

376
00:17:53,736 --> 00:17:55,076
from our tile set editor.

377
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:59,196
And I can select

378
00:17:59,196 --> 00:18:02,716
and you can see we just have, so

379
00:17:59,196 --> 00:18:02,716
and you can see we just have, so

380
00:18:02,716 --> 00:18:03,816
that are in our animation.

381
00:18:04,096 --> 00:18:06,576
Now, we give it a time per

382
00:18:06,576 --> 00:18:08,956
Now, this is basically

383
00:18:08,956 --> 00:18:10,306
with textures app should works.

384
00:18:10,846 --> 00:18:12,576
And it's just that easy

385
00:18:13,026 --> 00:18:15,196
Which is a really great way of

386
00:18:16,886 --> 00:18:21,716
But in additional to frame

387
00:18:22,936 --> 00:18:24,936
we can also animate the

388
00:18:25,636 --> 00:18:28,016
So, the tile maps

389
00:18:28,016 --> 00:18:31,046
So, you can do everything

390
00:18:31,046 --> 00:18:33,426
So of course you can

391
00:18:33,536 --> 00:18:36,076
You can scale them.

392
00:18:36,786 --> 00:18:38,526
You can rotate them.

393
00:18:38,526 --> 00:18:42,186
I note that you can still

394
00:18:42,186 --> 00:18:44,106
while they're like this although

395
00:18:44,106 --> 00:18:46,696
when you're at some weird angles

396
00:18:48,076 --> 00:18:52,806
But because SK nodes, the

397
00:18:53,076 --> 00:18:54,636
we can run actions on them.

398
00:18:55,036 --> 00:18:57,356
So, here you see I have a bunch

399
00:18:57,356 --> 00:19:00,166
up on my tile map by moving

400
00:18:57,356 --> 00:19:00,166
up on my tile map by moving

401
00:19:00,656 --> 00:19:02,096
So, we just animate this thing.

402
00:19:02,096 --> 00:19:05,276
We can see yeah, we

403
00:19:05,406 --> 00:19:09,246
and then we put it back.

404
00:19:09,246 --> 00:19:10,536
And so you see that

405
00:19:10,536 --> 00:19:12,136
of bringing animation

406
00:19:12,136 --> 00:19:13,126
which can be really useful.

407
00:19:13,756 --> 00:19:18,116
In fact, we can leverage this

408
00:19:18,396 --> 00:19:19,796
to create some interesting

409
00:19:21,896 --> 00:19:24,736
So, in this scene, I've got

410
00:19:24,736 --> 00:19:26,346
up in our tile map here.

411
00:19:27,396 --> 00:19:28,526
Don't want to do that yet.

412
00:19:29,256 --> 00:19:33,446
And if I position the camera

413
00:19:34,316 --> 00:19:37,966
we're simply moving these tile

414
00:19:38,086 --> 00:19:41,126
and this achieves the

415
00:19:41,126 --> 00:19:43,426
an effect that we call

416
00:19:43,596 --> 00:19:48,186
And all I'm doing here is simply

417
00:19:48,186 --> 00:19:51,776
at one rate of speed, the middle

418
00:19:51,776 --> 00:19:54,056
and the background layer

419
00:19:54,056 --> 00:19:56,166
And that achieves the

420
00:19:56,326 --> 00:19:57,776
And it's just incredibly easy.

421
00:19:59,056 --> 00:20:04,636
So, in addition to having simple

422
00:19:59,056 --> 00:20:04,636
So, in addition to having simple

423
00:20:04,976 --> 00:20:06,946
we also have support

424
00:20:07,136 --> 00:20:08,796
and isometric tiles as well.

425
00:20:09,206 --> 00:20:12,006
So, you have lots of flexibility

426
00:20:12,006 --> 00:20:13,876
that you can achieve

427
00:20:14,526 --> 00:20:19,496
So, speaking of which,

428
00:20:19,496 --> 00:20:20,496
at a game sample right now.

429
00:20:26,296 --> 00:20:28,456
So, here we've got a little

430
00:20:29,406 --> 00:20:32,126
A little guy that

431
00:20:32,216 --> 00:20:34,956
And you can see that I got

432
00:20:34,956 --> 00:20:35,916
on in the background.

433
00:20:35,956 --> 00:20:39,876
And you'll note that I'm

434
00:20:40,946 --> 00:20:46,886
And I achieve this by

435
00:20:46,886 --> 00:20:50,696
that we can put on

436
00:20:50,996 --> 00:20:52,896
Here, I'll show you

437
00:20:52,896 --> 00:20:58,636
Select one of the variants here.

438
00:20:58,636 --> 00:21:00,946
And you can see that we have

439
00:20:58,636 --> 00:21:00,946
And you can see that we have

440
00:21:01,716 --> 00:21:04,176
And I just have a

441
00:21:04,276 --> 00:21:06,036
which is a Boolean,

442
00:21:06,786 --> 00:21:09,466
So, in code, I'm going

443
00:21:09,466 --> 00:21:12,046
in our platform demo

444
00:21:12,046 --> 00:21:13,366
for all of these edge tiles.

445
00:21:13,366 --> 00:21:15,986
And whenever I find one,

446
00:21:15,986 --> 00:21:19,486
to allow the player

447
00:21:24,856 --> 00:21:29,986
And since it is just in our tile

448
00:21:29,986 --> 00:21:32,316
over this large wall here.

449
00:21:32,926 --> 00:21:36,266
When I run the game, you'll see

450
00:21:36,266 --> 00:21:40,476
that my guy can't actually jump

451
00:21:40,516 --> 00:21:42,456
And he really wants to

452
00:21:42,456 --> 00:21:43,596
over there looks

453
00:21:43,596 --> 00:21:44,616
I really want to

454
00:21:45,966 --> 00:21:50,726
So, since we're just generating

455
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:53,216
and our user data, all we

456
00:21:53,316 --> 00:22:01,756
and erase these tiles and

457
00:21:53,316 --> 00:22:01,756
and erase these tiles and

458
00:22:02,296 --> 00:22:06,646
The tiles are now gone and we

459
00:22:06,646 --> 00:22:08,636
And we didn't have to

460
00:22:08,636 --> 00:22:11,076
We just used the

461
00:22:11,076 --> 00:22:13,116
from the tile map

462
00:22:13,266 --> 00:22:14,156
It's that simple.

463
00:22:15,421 --> 00:22:17,421
[ Applause ]

464
00:22:17,826 --> 00:22:19,476
And now as a reward, I

465
00:22:20,496 --> 00:22:21,446
Yay.

466
00:22:29,086 --> 00:22:32,666
So, that's how our tile

467
00:22:36,406 --> 00:22:39,456
So, now that we've shown you

468
00:22:39,456 --> 00:22:42,046
let's take a look at the

469
00:22:43,106 --> 00:22:45,846
And if you're creating tile

470
00:22:45,916 --> 00:22:48,296
you're not going to need to

471
00:22:48,686 --> 00:22:50,336
But it's good to get an

472
00:22:51,166 --> 00:22:54,486
So, tile maps are implemented

473
00:22:54,766 --> 00:22:57,386
which as mentioned in the

474
00:22:58,036 --> 00:22:59,286
It holds all the information

475
00:22:59,286 --> 00:23:00,606
about the tiles you've

476
00:22:59,286 --> 00:23:00,606
about the tiles you've

477
00:23:01,636 --> 00:23:04,136
But to be able to place tiles,

478
00:23:04,316 --> 00:23:08,186
And the tile set is defined

479
00:23:08,806 --> 00:23:10,636
It contains all the tile

480
00:23:11,156 --> 00:23:13,916
Additionally, it also defines

481
00:23:13,916 --> 00:23:16,726
and they can either be

482
00:23:16,726 --> 00:23:18,976
isometric tiles or

483
00:23:19,636 --> 00:23:24,126
The tile groups are defined

484
00:23:24,826 --> 00:23:26,976
And as we saw on the demo,

485
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:28,846
of related tiles,

486
00:23:28,966 --> 00:23:30,566
of terrain like grass or water.

487
00:23:31,556 --> 00:23:33,176
The tile group also

488
00:23:33,176 --> 00:23:34,886
that define how the

489
00:23:34,886 --> 00:23:38,086
in the group should

490
00:23:38,156 --> 00:23:40,896
And those rules are defined

491
00:23:41,426 --> 00:23:44,196
That also holds all the

492
00:23:44,196 --> 00:23:45,856
with the pattern it describes.

493
00:23:45,926 --> 00:23:49,736
And finally, each

494
00:23:49,916 --> 00:23:51,326
through an SKTileDefinition

495
00:23:51,586 --> 00:23:53,296
which defines the

496
00:23:54,006 --> 00:23:57,316
Each one has at least one image

497
00:23:57,316 --> 00:23:59,086
they can be animated

498
00:23:59,086 --> 00:24:00,686
to help bring life

499
00:23:59,086 --> 00:24:00,686
to help bring life

500
00:24:01,556 --> 00:24:04,406
Additionally, the tiles can

501
00:24:04,406 --> 00:24:07,336
allowing you to get more

502
00:24:07,686 --> 00:24:11,046
Now, let's take a

503
00:24:11,046 --> 00:24:12,636
so you can see how

504
00:24:12,636 --> 00:24:14,286
and modify a tile

505
00:24:15,476 --> 00:24:17,866
The first step is to get the

506
00:24:18,236 --> 00:24:20,176
Now, you can create

507
00:24:20,406 --> 00:24:23,086
but it's a very involved

508
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:25,376
that you create them

509
00:24:26,876 --> 00:24:28,576
Getting one you've

510
00:24:29,266 --> 00:24:31,766
Just call this convenience

511
00:24:31,766 --> 00:24:33,156
of the tile set that

512
00:24:35,506 --> 00:24:38,136
Then, to create a new tile

513
00:24:38,136 --> 00:24:41,406
with the tile set we want to

514
00:24:41,406 --> 00:24:44,366
and rows in the map along

515
00:24:45,956 --> 00:24:47,996
If you want to start

516
00:24:48,086 --> 00:24:49,236
we're going to need

517
00:24:49,896 --> 00:24:52,176
So, here we're just grabbing

518
00:24:52,496 --> 00:24:55,166
in the tile set.

519
00:24:55,446 --> 00:24:58,576
Once we have a tile map and a

520
00:24:58,976 --> 00:25:00,716
we can start setting

521
00:24:58,976 --> 00:25:00,716
we can start setting

522
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:03,176
Here we're setting

523
00:25:03,216 --> 00:25:05,556
on the tile at column 4, row 7.

524
00:25:06,176 --> 00:25:09,946
We can also operate on

525
00:25:10,336 --> 00:25:12,736
Here we are filling every tile

526
00:25:13,466 --> 00:25:17,566
So, if you're creating

527
00:25:17,566 --> 00:25:20,256
through the SpriteKit editor,

528
00:25:20,256 --> 00:25:21,376
of the API we just covered.

529
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:23,426
But unless you're

530
00:25:23,426 --> 00:25:26,706
for entirely static backgrounds,

531
00:25:26,706 --> 00:25:28,096
to be able to query them.

532
00:25:28,096 --> 00:25:29,616
There are a bunch of

533
00:25:30,576 --> 00:25:32,836
Say for instance you want to

534
00:25:32,836 --> 00:25:34,046
over a particular tile

535
00:25:34,436 --> 00:25:36,726
and inject some custom

536
00:25:36,726 --> 00:25:37,616
on the tile definition.

537
00:25:38,236 --> 00:25:43,256
You can do this by first

538
00:25:43,446 --> 00:25:47,136
and a tile maps frame

539
00:25:47,576 --> 00:25:49,616
Then, you'd use the

540
00:25:50,126 --> 00:25:51,816
to get the column

541
00:25:51,896 --> 00:25:55,076
that contains that position.

542
00:25:55,186 --> 00:25:57,716
Next, you query the tile

543
00:25:57,806 --> 00:25:59,136
in that column and row.

544
00:25:59,136 --> 00:26:03,796
And finally, now that you've

545
00:25:59,136 --> 00:26:03,796
And finally, now that you've

546
00:26:04,256 --> 00:26:06,616
you can check the user

547
00:26:06,616 --> 00:26:07,296
that you're interested in.

548
00:26:07,616 --> 00:26:10,196
And then act on that data

549
00:26:10,376 --> 00:26:13,596
And the demo we just showed,

550
00:26:13,596 --> 00:26:16,266
to this to detect

551
00:26:16,266 --> 00:26:17,066
on the big red button.

552
00:26:18,106 --> 00:26:18,826
When they are over a tile

553
00:26:18,826 --> 00:26:21,026
with a button custom

554
00:26:21,356 --> 00:26:22,446
we trigger the fireworks.

555
00:26:23,206 --> 00:26:26,536
It's all a lot to take in,

556
00:26:26,536 --> 00:26:29,526
so let's quickly recap the

557
00:26:31,286 --> 00:26:34,596
By creating scenes from a set

558
00:26:34,766 --> 00:26:37,286
tile maps help you get more

559
00:26:38,256 --> 00:26:40,226
Overall, you'll need

560
00:26:40,226 --> 00:26:43,206
and it also brings the benefit

561
00:26:44,166 --> 00:26:46,976
They support animation, both in

562
00:26:47,436 --> 00:26:48,796
and actions at the node level.

563
00:26:50,856 --> 00:26:53,266
Tile maps are designed to be

564
00:26:53,516 --> 00:26:55,996
which further increases the

565
00:26:56,026 --> 00:26:58,256
and enables effects

566
00:26:59,546 --> 00:27:01,746
They're extremely

567
00:26:59,546 --> 00:27:01,746
They're extremely

568
00:27:01,746 --> 00:27:05,816
of different art styles

569
00:27:06,746 --> 00:27:08,986
Large tile maps are

570
00:27:09,246 --> 00:27:11,756
into smaller chunks

571
00:27:11,756 --> 00:27:13,306
that are currently

572
00:27:14,006 --> 00:27:16,096
which provides a big

573
00:27:16,296 --> 00:27:20,146
Additionally, if all the tile

574
00:27:20,146 --> 00:27:22,206
in the same Asset

575
00:27:22,666 --> 00:27:25,966
each chunk will batch all the

576
00:27:25,966 --> 00:27:26,956
with a single draw call.

577
00:27:28,306 --> 00:27:30,046
Tile maps also come in

578
00:27:30,456 --> 00:27:34,136
standard square grids, isometric

579
00:27:34,726 --> 00:27:39,926
On the tool side, editing

580
00:27:40,506 --> 00:27:42,556
Just point and click to

581
00:27:43,236 --> 00:27:46,346
Automapping does all the hard

582
00:27:46,346 --> 00:27:48,906
to individually place

583
00:27:49,086 --> 00:27:51,346
And you can of course

584
00:27:51,346 --> 00:27:52,746
to do the detail work by hand.

585
00:27:53,846 --> 00:27:57,016
Finally, creating new tile

586
00:27:57,796 --> 00:28:00,116
Just drag-and-drop the

587
00:27:57,796 --> 00:28:00,116
Just drag-and-drop the

588
00:28:00,116 --> 00:28:02,556
into their corresponding

589
00:28:02,556 --> 00:28:03,666
and you're good to go.

590
00:28:03,666 --> 00:28:06,866
So, that covers tile sets.

591
00:28:07,646 --> 00:28:09,076
Now I'd like to invite

592
00:28:09,076 --> 00:28:10,166
up to talk to you about the rest

593
00:28:10,166 --> 00:28:11,746
of the awesome features

594
00:28:12,516 --> 00:28:17,500
[ Applause ]

595
00:28:20,766 --> 00:28:21,666
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Ross.

596
00:28:22,466 --> 00:28:24,856
All right, some cool

597
00:28:27,116 --> 00:28:27,996
So, hello.

598
00:28:27,996 --> 00:28:28,796
My name is Clement.

599
00:28:29,286 --> 00:28:30,836
I'm a software engineer

600
00:28:30,836 --> 00:28:31,996
in the Game Technologies Team.

601
00:28:32,876 --> 00:28:34,246
And guess what?

602
00:28:34,246 --> 00:28:35,876
We actually have

603
00:28:35,876 --> 00:28:37,386
so let's see what else

604
00:28:38,106 --> 00:28:40,606
And the first up is

605
00:28:42,876 --> 00:28:46,906
So, currently you have many ways

606
00:28:47,426 --> 00:28:50,546
You can apply a scale to make

607
00:28:51,616 --> 00:28:55,806
You can apply a rotation to

608
00:28:55,906 --> 00:28:59,486
Or if you like to

609
00:28:59,596 --> 00:29:01,216
you can also write

610
00:28:59,596 --> 00:29:01,216
you can also write

611
00:29:01,836 --> 00:29:05,246
such as this low

612
00:29:05,246 --> 00:29:10,066
that you can see right there.

613
00:29:10,246 --> 00:29:12,526
This year we're very happy

614
00:29:12,526 --> 00:29:14,446
of transformation called

615
00:29:15,236 --> 00:29:16,456
Warp Transformation allows you

616
00:29:16,456 --> 00:29:19,416
to define a custom distortion

617
00:29:19,806 --> 00:29:23,906
So, for example if we

618
00:29:24,086 --> 00:29:26,836
it's basically 8 points

619
00:29:26,836 --> 00:29:29,866
in green is our source position,

620
00:29:30,846 --> 00:29:32,526
Then I get a second grid here

621
00:29:32,656 --> 00:29:33,986
but it's going to

622
00:29:34,476 --> 00:29:36,516
So, what you see here is

623
00:29:36,706 --> 00:29:38,206
and as you can see,

624
00:29:38,206 --> 00:29:39,556
around to create a distortion.

625
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:42,846
So now if I apply like

626
00:29:42,846 --> 00:29:48,116
of earlier, this is what I get.

627
00:29:48,346 --> 00:29:49,716
As you can see, we get a nice

628
00:29:49,716 --> 00:29:51,576
and smooth distortion

629
00:29:52,096 --> 00:29:54,486
And the distortion is going

630
00:29:54,486 --> 00:29:56,236
between the source and

631
00:29:56,446 --> 00:29:59,736
So, let me show you some

632
00:29:59,996 --> 00:30:00,936
with Warp Transformation.

633
00:29:59,996 --> 00:30:00,936
with Warp Transformation.

634
00:30:01,496 --> 00:30:05,626
And my first example

635
00:30:05,806 --> 00:30:08,186
So, what I'm doing here is just

636
00:30:08,186 --> 00:30:10,416
center to create a

637
00:30:10,416 --> 00:30:13,706
Next, I had a stretch effect.

638
00:30:13,706 --> 00:30:15,666
I am pulling the

639
00:30:15,666 --> 00:30:17,506
and making it wiggle

640
00:30:18,276 --> 00:30:19,436
It can look a bit funny.

641
00:30:20,216 --> 00:30:23,706
And the next big thing here

642
00:30:24,826 --> 00:30:27,966
So, usually in 2D games

643
00:30:27,966 --> 00:30:30,066
to make static frames

644
00:30:30,716 --> 00:30:32,676
And it's a pretty long

645
00:30:32,676 --> 00:30:34,776
to iterate a new

646
00:30:35,356 --> 00:30:38,476
And Warp Transformation,

647
00:30:38,476 --> 00:30:39,836
as just moving points around.

648
00:30:39,836 --> 00:30:42,126
And if you have any

649
00:30:42,126 --> 00:30:43,576
such as a keyframe-based

650
00:30:43,946 --> 00:30:46,506
you can just provide multiple

651
00:30:46,506 --> 00:30:47,356
to be done at one time.

652
00:30:47,576 --> 00:30:49,016
You no longer need

653
00:30:50,216 --> 00:30:53,916
So, now let me explain you

654
00:30:54,136 --> 00:30:54,916
Warp Transformation.

655
00:30:55,726 --> 00:30:59,756
So again, if we have a 2 by 2

656
00:30:59,756 --> 00:31:03,636
of points from 0 to

657
00:30:59,756 --> 00:31:03,636
of points from 0 to

658
00:31:05,256 --> 00:31:08,216
This point, this point,

659
00:31:08,216 --> 00:31:10,686
in this grid are quad

660
00:31:11,056 --> 00:31:13,566
So, now from the computer

661
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:16,696
what we have here is a list

662
00:31:17,206 --> 00:31:20,226
and texture coordinates are

663
00:31:20,606 --> 00:31:24,526
And then you just set the GPU

664
00:31:25,416 --> 00:31:27,646
So, this is fine and we

665
00:31:27,646 --> 00:31:31,026
but initially what happens if I

666
00:31:31,416 --> 00:31:33,776
and I limit it to one quad

667
00:31:33,776 --> 00:31:36,056
by 1 grid, so, come on.

668
00:31:36,056 --> 00:31:36,926
Show me some distortion.

669
00:31:37,146 --> 00:31:39,606
All right, go for it.

670
00:31:40,676 --> 00:31:42,776
Yeah, it doesn't

671
00:31:43,456 --> 00:31:46,526
And the reason why is because

672
00:31:46,866 --> 00:31:48,606
so only one triangle

673
00:31:48,946 --> 00:31:50,646
So, what can we do about this?

674
00:31:51,376 --> 00:31:53,216
Well, we could make

675
00:31:53,256 --> 00:31:54,436
and upload more quads.

676
00:31:54,496 --> 00:31:56,596
But then it's kind

677
00:31:56,596 --> 00:31:58,106
because you have more

678
00:31:58,676 --> 00:32:00,446
Especially because

679
00:31:58,676 --> 00:32:00,446
Especially because

680
00:32:00,916 --> 00:32:02,306
It's almost as if

681
00:32:02,386 --> 00:32:03,626
move pixels around, right?

682
00:32:04,906 --> 00:32:08,086
So, no. As you have guessed,

683
00:32:08,516 --> 00:32:09,986
So, in SpriteKit,

684
00:32:10,796 --> 00:32:12,076
Again, 2 by 2 grid.

685
00:32:13,206 --> 00:32:15,386
We, so you only have

686
00:32:15,866 --> 00:32:17,076
and as you do the distortion

687
00:32:17,076 --> 00:32:19,606
of the points moving

688
00:32:24,436 --> 00:32:25,086
There we go.

689
00:32:26,346 --> 00:32:28,636
So, we do automatic quad

690
00:32:29,176 --> 00:32:32,006
And this is great because it

691
00:32:32,006 --> 00:32:33,786
between a high level of details

692
00:32:34,176 --> 00:32:36,636
and minimal quads

693
00:32:37,356 --> 00:32:39,406
And again, you only

694
00:32:39,776 --> 00:32:42,076
So, here, as I move the

695
00:32:42,586 --> 00:32:45,006
you can see that I'm going

696
00:32:45,006 --> 00:32:46,166
of distortion is a bit high.

697
00:32:46,576 --> 00:32:47,846
So we you do subdivision.

698
00:32:48,376 --> 00:32:50,686
But at the bottom right, it's

699
00:32:50,686 --> 00:32:52,446
so we only subdivide twice.

700
00:32:54,056 --> 00:32:56,776
And because we want to

701
00:32:56,776 --> 00:32:59,116
we actually allow you to

702
00:32:59,116 --> 00:32:59,826
of subdivision.

703
00:32:59,986 --> 00:33:02,246
So, if I take my

704
00:32:59,986 --> 00:33:02,246
So, if I take my

705
00:33:02,486 --> 00:33:05,216
and I make it a bit distorted

706
00:33:05,216 --> 00:33:06,746
you might see some

707
00:33:06,746 --> 00:33:09,446
some artifacts throwing up,

708
00:33:10,046 --> 00:33:12,236
So, if I go with

709
00:33:12,346 --> 00:33:13,206
you might see artifacts.

710
00:33:13,566 --> 00:33:15,186
But if you go up

711
00:33:15,586 --> 00:33:17,386
we clearly lose all

712
00:33:17,386 --> 00:33:20,056
and have this nice smooth line

713
00:33:21,026 --> 00:33:23,096
So again, this is perfect

714
00:33:23,096 --> 00:33:26,186
to tune your visuals

715
00:33:26,336 --> 00:33:28,006
Because of course, the

716
00:33:28,166 --> 00:33:30,056
the best for performance.

717
00:33:30,996 --> 00:33:33,276
All right, this is cool but

718
00:33:33,906 --> 00:33:35,226
Okay, so first thing.

719
00:33:35,376 --> 00:33:36,726
Remember, we have a grid layout.

720
00:33:37,006 --> 00:33:39,166
So, 8 points labeled

721
00:33:39,866 --> 00:33:42,056
I'm going to provide a

722
00:33:42,356 --> 00:33:44,736
a list of definition position,

723
00:33:45,386 --> 00:33:47,956
I can just create my

724
00:33:48,006 --> 00:33:51,066
by providing the column, the

725
00:33:51,066 --> 00:33:53,856
source positions, and then

726
00:33:54,456 --> 00:33:55,856
And we have the distortion.

727
00:33:56,276 --> 00:33:59,146
And optionally you can

728
00:33:59,146 --> 00:34:01,416
to whatever you want

729
00:33:59,146 --> 00:34:01,416
to whatever you want

730
00:34:01,926 --> 00:34:05,886
And because it is SpriteKit,

731
00:34:05,886 --> 00:34:07,326
of new SK actions

732
00:34:07,776 --> 00:34:09,556
So, making a transformation

733
00:34:09,556 --> 00:34:13,485
as just saying SKActionWarp

734
00:34:14,356 --> 00:34:15,846
Or, if you have something

735
00:34:16,025 --> 00:34:18,246
such as a keyframe-based

736
00:34:18,246 --> 00:34:20,686
you can provide a list of

737
00:34:21,246 --> 00:34:22,005
All right.

738
00:34:22,636 --> 00:34:25,306
So, okay, let's do

739
00:34:25,306 --> 00:34:26,775
to show you Warp

740
00:34:35,835 --> 00:34:37,636
Alright. So, I'm actually going

741
00:34:37,636 --> 00:34:43,156
to be using the same demo is

742
00:34:43,156 --> 00:34:45,085
to go on the left

743
00:34:45,085 --> 00:34:46,696
where all the cool stuff is.

744
00:34:47,456 --> 00:34:49,146
All right, so we

745
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:51,856
let's go explore for a bit.

746
00:34:51,856 --> 00:34:53,536
Oh, look at that.

747
00:34:53,536 --> 00:34:56,096
All right, so what we have

748
00:34:56,556 --> 00:34:58,916
We have one animation that

749
00:34:58,916 --> 00:35:02,266
to right and one that makes your

750
00:34:58,916 --> 00:35:02,266
to right and one that makes your

751
00:35:02,346 --> 00:35:03,786
a bigger size to smaller size.

752
00:35:04,336 --> 00:35:05,636
And we also added

753
00:35:05,636 --> 00:35:07,486
to make things rotate

754
00:35:08,186 --> 00:35:10,866
It just makes your scene much

755
00:35:11,666 --> 00:35:13,216
Okay, so let's keep

756
00:35:13,786 --> 00:35:16,066
Okay, oh, look at this,

757
00:35:16,746 --> 00:35:18,746
Well, what's the best way

758
00:35:18,886 --> 00:35:20,236
I think it's just to

759
00:35:21,616 --> 00:35:22,096
There ago.

760
00:35:22,916 --> 00:35:25,376
So, what I did here is just

761
00:35:25,376 --> 00:35:27,236
and then the collision

762
00:35:27,736 --> 00:35:30,266
I'm just running in SKAction

763
00:35:31,076 --> 00:35:32,386
All right, so that's

764
00:35:32,446 --> 00:35:34,866
Let's go back to the slides.

765
00:35:38,756 --> 00:35:40,856
So, Warp Transformations

766
00:35:41,006 --> 00:35:43,636
and enable a broad range of

767
00:35:43,946 --> 00:35:45,986
So I really hope you're going to

768
00:35:45,986 --> 00:35:48,276
And next let's talk

769
00:35:48,276 --> 00:35:50,726
about per-node attributes

770
00:35:52,916 --> 00:35:54,266
Shaders are awesome.

771
00:35:54,536 --> 00:35:55,386
I really love shaders.

772
00:35:55,936 --> 00:35:57,726
And there is a best way for you

773
00:35:57,726 --> 00:36:00,636
to make exact digital

774
00:35:57,726 --> 00:36:00,636
to make exact digital

775
00:36:01,096 --> 00:36:03,926
In SpriteKit, we support custom

776
00:36:04,006 --> 00:36:07,216
with SKShader class which is

777
00:36:07,356 --> 00:36:10,036
which you apply to your nodes.

778
00:36:10,486 --> 00:36:13,826
It comes with a few built-in

779
00:36:13,826 --> 00:36:16,176
the texture, texture

780
00:36:16,246 --> 00:36:18,486
And if you have any

781
00:36:18,486 --> 00:36:21,636
you can also specify

782
00:36:21,636 --> 00:36:24,186
for your special variables.

783
00:36:25,036 --> 00:36:27,846
All right, so what about we

784
00:36:28,006 --> 00:36:29,676
Okay, so I really

785
00:36:29,676 --> 00:36:30,886
So, what about some platforms.

786
00:36:30,886 --> 00:36:32,256
Here we go, that's pretty good.

787
00:36:32,886 --> 00:36:37,466
Okay, I want something

788
00:36:37,466 --> 00:36:38,656
Oh yeah, that's awesome.

789
00:36:38,656 --> 00:36:39,956
I love this guy,

790
00:36:39,956 --> 00:36:43,686
Right? You know what, I'm going

791
00:36:43,746 --> 00:36:45,896
So let's put some

792
00:36:45,896 --> 00:36:48,026
and danger, just like that.

793
00:36:48,296 --> 00:36:49,266
Right, that's better.

794
00:36:50,306 --> 00:36:52,546
Unfortunately our bunny's

795
00:36:53,306 --> 00:36:55,386
and because I want I don't

796
00:36:55,386 --> 00:36:56,996
I'm going to have the

797
00:36:56,996 --> 00:36:58,606
and the health bar,

798
00:36:59,226 --> 00:37:00,326
And guess what?

799
00:36:59,226 --> 00:37:00,326
And guess what?

800
00:37:00,526 --> 00:37:01,716
The health bar is

801
00:37:03,226 --> 00:37:03,976
You see it coming, right?

802
00:37:04,256 --> 00:37:07,746
Okay. So, how would I go

803
00:37:07,746 --> 00:37:09,736
making a health bar

804
00:37:10,136 --> 00:37:12,456
So I add a Sprite

805
00:37:12,456 --> 00:37:14,496
I have a shader to

806
00:37:14,576 --> 00:37:16,656
such as the blinking

807
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:17,966
and how filled in it is.

808
00:37:18,186 --> 00:37:20,566
So, here our bunny

809
00:37:20,686 --> 00:37:21,886
so it's only filled halfway.

810
00:37:21,886 --> 00:37:23,896
And to control these visuals,

811
00:37:24,006 --> 00:37:25,736
I have a uniform

812
00:37:26,026 --> 00:37:27,846
It's going to be a flood

813
00:37:27,846 --> 00:37:30,636
from one being full-life

814
00:37:30,636 --> 00:37:31,876
to not full-life.

815
00:37:31,986 --> 00:37:35,446
Okay. But because games

816
00:37:35,446 --> 00:37:37,876
when you have multiple players,

817
00:37:37,976 --> 00:37:39,306
We can have up to three players.

818
00:37:39,816 --> 00:37:42,276
To, that means at any time

819
00:37:42,276 --> 00:37:44,306
full-life, someone

820
00:37:44,306 --> 00:37:46,246
and someone who's pretty

821
00:37:47,266 --> 00:37:49,836
Okay, so again, In

822
00:37:49,836 --> 00:37:52,456
I have my Sprite, my

823
00:37:52,966 --> 00:37:54,846
But now how would I go

824
00:37:54,996 --> 00:37:56,236
with multiple players?

825
00:37:56,816 --> 00:37:58,116
Well, I have to do this.

826
00:37:59,126 --> 00:38:00,766
Yeah, I have to duplicate

827
00:37:59,126 --> 00:38:00,766
Yeah, I have to duplicate

828
00:38:00,766 --> 00:38:02,416
but that just doesn't

829
00:38:02,416 --> 00:38:03,446
Why do we have to do that?

830
00:38:03,446 --> 00:38:04,426
That's just bad.

831
00:38:04,426 --> 00:38:07,196
And it's bad because, while

832
00:38:07,496 --> 00:38:09,316
And it's going to break

833
00:38:09,316 --> 00:38:10,446
meaning more draw calls.

834
00:38:10,446 --> 00:38:12,376
And it's just too

835
00:38:12,376 --> 00:38:15,326
Well, if you wanted to

836
00:38:15,326 --> 00:38:19,366
I have only one shader and

837
00:38:19,856 --> 00:38:25,076
And, well, starting this

838
00:38:25,216 --> 00:38:26,216
that using attributes.

839
00:38:27,106 --> 00:38:29,416
With custom attributes, you

840
00:38:29,756 --> 00:38:32,756
attach it to your shader, and

841
00:38:33,006 --> 00:38:34,086
on the nodes themself.

842
00:38:34,426 --> 00:38:36,896
So, here I have a custom

843
00:38:36,896 --> 00:38:39,786
and I just set the health

844
00:38:39,976 --> 00:38:40,686
It's super simple.

845
00:38:40,686 --> 00:38:43,916
In Swift, this is

846
00:38:44,106 --> 00:38:46,646
I'm creating my attribute

847
00:38:46,996 --> 00:38:49,566
I give it a name, so here,

848
00:38:50,306 --> 00:38:51,696
I attach it to my shader.

849
00:38:52,116 --> 00:38:54,406
Because my shader only

850
00:38:54,406 --> 00:38:55,776
I'm giving a list

851
00:38:56,506 --> 00:38:59,126
Lastly I can directly set

852
00:38:59,546 --> 00:39:03,716
So, here play one has only

853
00:38:59,546 --> 00:39:03,716
So, here play one has only

854
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:07,826
so I'm just doing set attribute

855
00:39:08,476 --> 00:39:10,996
So, this is very convenient

856
00:39:10,996 --> 00:39:13,456
with per-node customization

857
00:39:14,656 --> 00:39:15,266
All right.

858
00:39:16,626 --> 00:39:19,686
So, now let's talk about a

859
00:39:19,686 --> 00:39:22,256
And the first one being focus

860
00:39:23,686 --> 00:39:26,176
So, for those of you who've

861
00:39:26,176 --> 00:39:28,956
for Apple TV, you already know

862
00:39:29,286 --> 00:39:30,256
But for those of you who do not,

863
00:39:30,386 --> 00:39:31,906
let me just recap what

864
00:39:33,046 --> 00:39:36,036
Last year we introduced

865
00:39:36,616 --> 00:39:39,306
tvOS and its brand-new

866
00:39:39,306 --> 00:39:41,276
as the Siri remote

867
00:39:41,776 --> 00:39:44,846
So, now one of the major

868
00:39:44,846 --> 00:39:46,866
and Apple TV is interaction.

869
00:39:47,746 --> 00:39:49,986
So, on iPhone the user's

870
00:39:49,986 --> 00:39:51,616
on the phone by touching

871
00:39:52,266 --> 00:39:53,586
On Apple TV on the other hand,

872
00:39:54,206 --> 00:39:56,316
the user will always have

873
00:39:56,316 --> 00:39:58,276
between him and the interface.

874
00:39:58,276 --> 00:40:00,456
And we actually call

875
00:39:58,276 --> 00:40:00,456
And we actually call

876
00:40:00,456 --> 00:40:01,656
focus-based interaction.

877
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:05,396
So, let me show you what happens

878
00:40:05,396 --> 00:40:08,846
in the main menu of the

879
00:40:15,186 --> 00:40:19,086
So, as you can see, we only

880
00:40:19,086 --> 00:40:21,406
and scrolling ware is

881
00:40:21,406 --> 00:40:23,816
and react your fingertip

882
00:40:25,066 --> 00:40:27,106
So, in fact, this

883
00:40:27,156 --> 00:40:29,156
And it's so important

884
00:40:29,256 --> 00:40:31,836
and our frameworks using

885
00:40:32,336 --> 00:40:34,706
So it means that if you happen

886
00:40:34,706 --> 00:40:38,156
you don't need to re-create

887
00:40:38,616 --> 00:40:40,816
All you have to do is

888
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:43,126
say which one are focusable,

889
00:40:43,716 --> 00:40:45,906
It's very simple to use

890
00:40:45,906 --> 00:40:48,346
and provides a consistent user

891
00:40:48,536 --> 00:40:51,136
in the main menu of Apple

892
00:40:52,156 --> 00:40:54,856
And as a bonus, we support

893
00:40:55,166 --> 00:40:57,246
game controllers and many

894
00:40:57,246 --> 00:40:58,126
and many, many more.

895
00:40:58,906 --> 00:41:01,336
If you want to learn more about

896
00:40:58,906 --> 00:41:01,336
If you want to learn more about

897
00:41:01,626 --> 00:41:02,566
there is a session this week

898
00:41:02,686 --> 00:41:04,516
and you can find many

899
00:41:04,516 --> 00:41:07,496
All right, so the

900
00:41:07,496 --> 00:41:10,076
that we have SpriteKit

901
00:41:10,816 --> 00:41:11,636
So, that's pretty great.

902
00:41:11,636 --> 00:41:11,936
Yeah, thank you.

903
00:41:12,516 --> 00:41:15,936
[ Applause ]

904
00:41:16,436 --> 00:41:18,196
So, this is actually

905
00:41:18,196 --> 00:41:20,536
of user interface in your

906
00:41:20,906 --> 00:41:23,276
or you could have subbuilder

907
00:41:23,396 --> 00:41:26,696
such as a chess game

908
00:41:26,766 --> 00:41:31,796
And the cool thing here is

909
00:41:32,506 --> 00:41:33,766
What you can see

910
00:41:33,916 --> 00:41:36,686
It's a sample code app

911
00:41:36,686 --> 00:41:38,156
to be for iOS and macOS.

912
00:41:38,156 --> 00:41:42,496
We did a port to tvOS and

913
00:41:42,786 --> 00:41:45,606
to remove all this code for the

914
00:41:45,986 --> 00:41:47,516
It was just so much

915
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:50,896
Speaking of DemoBot,

916
00:41:50,896 --> 00:41:53,126
about creating this menu

917
00:41:53,336 --> 00:41:54,326
and focus interaction.

918
00:41:54,616 --> 00:41:57,576
The first thing you

919
00:41:57,576 --> 00:42:00,626
that UIKit introduces new

920
00:41:57,576 --> 00:42:00,626
that UIKit introduces new

921
00:42:00,986 --> 00:42:02,856
which conforms to the

922
00:42:03,296 --> 00:42:06,316
This extends the focus

923
00:42:07,086 --> 00:42:07,996
So, as you have guessed,

924
00:42:08,166 --> 00:42:10,906
now SKNode is actually

925
00:42:12,176 --> 00:42:15,306
So, the first thing you need

926
00:42:15,606 --> 00:42:16,956
So, here for my menu element,

927
00:42:16,956 --> 00:42:18,386
I'm going to use

928
00:42:18,386 --> 00:42:19,496
I'm going to use a SpriteNode.

929
00:42:19,976 --> 00:42:21,686
So first, make a subclass.

930
00:42:21,986 --> 00:42:25,556
Second, you need to override

931
00:42:25,556 --> 00:42:27,226
to true so that your

932
00:42:27,226 --> 00:42:32,456
Next you have to obtain your

933
00:42:32,826 --> 00:42:34,226
and to do that, you just have

934
00:42:34,226 --> 00:42:35,896
to set the

935
00:42:35,896 --> 00:42:36,476
to true.

936
00:42:37,576 --> 00:42:38,436
And the last thing you need

937
00:42:38,436 --> 00:42:41,386
to do is override the data

938
00:42:41,896 --> 00:42:44,016
which is going to give you

939
00:42:44,206 --> 00:42:46,786
So, you can override this

940
00:42:46,876 --> 00:42:48,846
or any node that actually

941
00:42:49,586 --> 00:42:52,786
So, here the context subject

942
00:42:52,786 --> 00:42:55,496
the previously focused item,

943
00:42:55,496 --> 00:42:58,636
for a menu element and

944
00:42:58,636 --> 00:42:59,966
I can just run some SKAction.

945
00:42:59,966 --> 00:43:02,656
So, this is how it

946
00:42:59,966 --> 00:43:02,656
So, this is how it

947
00:43:02,696 --> 00:43:05,376
As I finish the game, I am

948
00:43:05,476 --> 00:43:08,276
and I can just use my Siri

949
00:43:08,276 --> 00:43:10,056
or game controller, it

950
00:43:10,266 --> 00:43:12,076
And I have the same

951
00:43:12,076 --> 00:43:13,766
in the main menu on Apple TV.

952
00:43:14,386 --> 00:43:16,406
Again, very simple,

953
00:43:16,446 --> 00:43:18,886
We recommend highly

954
00:43:20,196 --> 00:43:22,276
All right, a pretty

955
00:43:23,126 --> 00:43:24,166
SpriteKit on Apple Watch.

956
00:43:24,606 --> 00:43:26,926
So, as you have seen,

957
00:43:27,086 --> 00:43:29,266
we brought some frameworks

958
00:43:30,106 --> 00:43:31,736
And yeah, SpriteKit

959
00:43:31,786 --> 00:43:35,406
So, that means that now you can

960
00:43:35,406 --> 00:43:38,006
using this high-performance

961
00:43:38,256 --> 00:43:40,416
And of course we bring

962
00:43:40,416 --> 00:43:43,326
such as particles,

963
00:43:43,836 --> 00:43:45,516
and all the editors

964
00:43:45,516 --> 00:43:46,666
so you can use the scene editor.

965
00:43:46,666 --> 00:43:48,056
You can use the particle editor.

966
00:43:48,056 --> 00:43:51,336
We have all the editing tools

967
00:43:51,336 --> 00:43:52,686
that Ross just told it out.

968
00:43:53,146 --> 00:43:54,196
All of this is just working.

969
00:43:55,516 --> 00:43:57,996
So, a typical SpriteKit

970
00:43:58,566 --> 00:44:02,546
I have an SKView and then

971
00:43:58,566 --> 00:44:02,546
I have an SKView and then

972
00:44:03,336 --> 00:44:05,066
which itself contains

973
00:44:06,286 --> 00:44:08,996
Such as the SpriteNode,

974
00:44:10,086 --> 00:44:13,226
On Apple Watch, though,

975
00:44:13,636 --> 00:44:15,506
Instead, you present

976
00:44:15,506 --> 00:44:16,506
WatchKit interface.

977
00:44:16,736 --> 00:44:18,886
And in fact it's going to be

978
00:44:19,456 --> 00:44:20,946
So, instead of using an SKView,

979
00:44:21,156 --> 00:44:24,306
I will be using a

980
00:44:24,306 --> 00:44:26,156
It looks pretty much it.

981
00:44:26,726 --> 00:44:29,636
All right, so let's see how we

982
00:44:29,636 --> 00:44:33,476
on iOS to make it a

983
00:44:33,856 --> 00:44:34,886
So, that's some code,

984
00:44:34,886 --> 00:44:36,976
that's some sample

985
00:44:37,376 --> 00:44:39,046
So, pretty typical,

986
00:44:39,046 --> 00:44:40,976
I'm doing some set up on

987
00:44:41,466 --> 00:44:41,856
All right.

988
00:44:41,856 --> 00:44:44,506
So, what I have to do now

989
00:44:45,006 --> 00:44:48,856
new, target, select

990
00:44:48,856 --> 00:44:53,806
So here I'm going to use a game

991
00:44:54,276 --> 00:44:54,926
Click next.

992
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:56,776
Give it the best name

993
00:44:56,776 --> 00:44:57,876
to call it Apple Watch Game.

994
00:44:58,376 --> 00:45:00,526
And then click next.

995
00:44:58,376 --> 00:45:00,526
And then click next.

996
00:45:00,796 --> 00:45:01,656
And you're done.

997
00:45:01,986 --> 00:45:02,896
No, seriously, you're done.

998
00:45:03,606 --> 00:45:05,276
Xcode is going to create

999
00:45:05,276 --> 00:45:09,046
such as the storyboard and the

1000
00:45:09,096 --> 00:45:12,026
And if you take a look at the

1001
00:45:12,026 --> 00:45:13,186
up everything for you already.

1002
00:45:13,726 --> 00:45:17,546
So, this guy is actually

1003
00:45:17,546 --> 00:45:18,686
as you can see at the top here.

1004
00:45:18,846 --> 00:45:20,516
And you're just ready to go.

1005
00:45:20,556 --> 00:45:22,866
You have your WKInterfaceScene

1006
00:45:23,366 --> 00:45:25,766
and you have the same

1007
00:45:25,806 --> 00:45:27,006
So, it's very simple.

1008
00:45:27,246 --> 00:45:33,626
All right, so some compatibility

1009
00:45:34,176 --> 00:45:36,126
There's no SKAudioNode

1010
00:45:36,126 --> 00:45:38,366
but of course you can

1011
00:45:38,366 --> 00:45:40,006
SKAction playSoundFileNamed.

1012
00:45:41,006 --> 00:45:43,766
There's no SKVidioNode

1013
00:45:43,766 --> 00:45:45,616
WKInterfaceMovie instead.

1014
00:45:46,186 --> 00:45:49,636
And lastly if you're doing a

1015
00:45:49,696 --> 00:45:52,346
you can still do them but

1016
00:45:53,576 --> 00:45:56,636
So, we're really excited

1017
00:45:56,636 --> 00:45:58,096
with Apple Watch in SpriteKit.

1018
00:45:58,406 --> 00:46:00,896
It's going to enable you to

1019
00:45:58,406 --> 00:46:00,896
It's going to enable you to

1020
00:46:00,896 --> 00:46:02,446
and fun apps with the platform.

1021
00:46:05,336 --> 00:46:05,956
All right.

1022
00:46:07,236 --> 00:46:07,946
Thank you.

1023

[ Applause ]

1024
00:46:12,616 --> 00:46:14,976
So, since we have more and more

1025
00:46:14,976 --> 00:46:17,426
about a few best

1026
00:46:18,156 --> 00:46:20,066
The first one being

1027
00:46:20,626 --> 00:46:21,826
Use Asset Catalog.

1028
00:46:22,306 --> 00:46:22,856
It's great.

1029
00:46:23,026 --> 00:46:25,386
It works very well with

1030
00:46:25,386 --> 00:46:26,736
of cool features for your game

1031
00:46:26,736 --> 00:46:28,616
to make things simple

1032
00:46:29,246 --> 00:46:31,186
The first thing being

1033
00:46:31,826 --> 00:46:34,146
In Asset Catalog, you

1034
00:46:34,146 --> 00:46:37,346
which is a fundamental piece

1035
00:46:37,426 --> 00:46:40,376
where you have multiple textures

1036
00:46:40,816 --> 00:46:43,686
which reduces the number of

1037
00:46:43,686 --> 00:46:47,606
Next we have support for

1038
00:46:47,606 --> 00:46:50,836
you know, 1x, 2x, 3x, which is

1039
00:46:50,836 --> 00:46:52,726
such as the iPad,

1040
00:46:53,126 --> 00:46:56,346
And again, you don't need to

1041
00:46:56,346 --> 00:46:57,676
is this that platform

1042
00:46:57,676 --> 00:47:00,306
No, you just call your

1043
00:46:57,676 --> 00:47:00,306
No, you just call your

1044
00:47:00,306 --> 00:47:01,156
We do rest for you.

1045
00:47:02,306 --> 00:47:04,106
We have support for

1046
00:47:04,106 --> 00:47:05,786
which is fundamental for tvOS.

1047
00:47:07,196 --> 00:47:08,966
And lastly we do app slicing,

1048
00:47:08,966 --> 00:47:10,336
meaning that if you

1049
00:47:10,336 --> 00:47:13,286
that are specific platform,

1050
00:47:13,286 --> 00:47:15,066
for the bundle and

1051
00:47:15,066 --> 00:47:17,506
into the runtime binaries

1052
00:47:17,866 --> 00:47:19,526
which gives you a

1053
00:47:19,526 --> 00:47:22,056
and a small download

1054
00:47:23,106 --> 00:47:26,706
So yeah, Asset Catalog

1055
00:47:26,976 --> 00:47:29,246
Next, about performance

1056
00:47:29,246 --> 00:47:32,286
So, a big change in

1057
00:47:32,286 --> 00:47:34,126
that we do not render

1058
00:47:34,126 --> 00:47:36,946
Now, we only render when

1059
00:47:37,316 --> 00:47:39,726
So, if something change, we

1060
00:47:39,726 --> 00:47:42,286
but if nothing changed, we

1061
00:47:42,866 --> 00:47:45,586
So, if you're using

1062
00:47:45,586 --> 00:47:46,796
such as the performance gauge,

1063
00:47:47,156 --> 00:47:48,596
you might see the

1064
00:47:48,826 --> 00:47:50,376
And it's actually a good

1065
00:47:50,376 --> 00:47:52,236
that you are not

1066
00:47:53,636 --> 00:47:55,176
If you need to control

1067
00:47:55,176 --> 00:47:57,416
you we also have a couple

1068
00:47:58,046 --> 00:48:00,266
The first one being

1069
00:47:58,046 --> 00:48:00,266
The first one being

1070
00:48:00,266 --> 00:48:00,866
on SKView.

1071
00:48:01,546 --> 00:48:03,876
At any time, you can

1072
00:48:03,876 --> 00:48:06,866
to whatever you want, which can

1073
00:48:06,866 --> 00:48:10,216
if you have the menu and you

1074
00:48:10,586 --> 00:48:12,996
And when you come back to your

1075
00:48:12,996 --> 00:48:15,166
or 30 FPS based on

1076
00:48:15,166 --> 00:48:18,516
The second one is a

1077
00:48:19,026 --> 00:48:20,256
It's a delegate in SKView

1078
00:48:20,636 --> 00:48:23,186
which is giving you

1079
00:48:23,306 --> 00:48:25,416
with the absolute

1080
00:48:25,836 --> 00:48:27,736
So, this method is going

1081
00:48:27,736 --> 00:48:29,896
and you can decide based

1082
00:48:29,896 --> 00:48:31,236
or no you want to

1083
00:48:31,536 --> 00:48:33,616
So, this gives you a

1084
00:48:33,616 --> 00:48:34,936
of the rendering for your game.

1085
00:48:35,036 --> 00:48:35,186
All right.

1086
00:48:35,386 --> 00:48:38,016
And that's it.

1087
00:48:38,436 --> 00:48:40,316
So, what's new in SpriteKit?

1088
00:48:40,316 --> 00:48:41,146
A lot this year.

1089
00:48:41,706 --> 00:48:44,766
The first being the scene

1090
00:48:44,766 --> 00:48:46,526
to manipulate your

1091
00:48:47,746 --> 00:48:49,136
The GameplayKit integration.

1092
00:48:49,406 --> 00:48:51,026
If you're already using

1093
00:48:51,026 --> 00:48:53,576
now you can just set them on

1094
00:48:53,916 --> 00:48:57,866
FPS high performance gauge which

1095
00:48:57,866 --> 00:49:00,366
of your scene performance,

1096
00:48:57,866 --> 00:49:00,366
of your scene performance,

1097
00:49:01,486 --> 00:49:04,936
Tile maps for complex yet

1098
00:49:05,406 --> 00:49:08,516
Warp Transformation to

1099
00:49:08,576 --> 00:49:11,366
and complex animation using

1100
00:49:12,836 --> 00:49:15,276
Per-node attributes

1101
00:49:15,276 --> 00:49:17,816
if you're using per-node

1102
00:49:17,816 --> 00:49:19,346
of shaders, very convenient.

1103
00:49:20,566 --> 00:49:24,056
And of course focus interaction

1104
00:49:24,056 --> 00:49:26,316
on Apple Watch, which is

1105
00:49:26,586 --> 00:49:28,926

1108
00:49:35,286 --> 00:49:36,136
of them are already done.

1109

00:49:37,906 --> 00:49:39,256
on the website we I

as well as Game Technologies

1113
00:49:44,956 --> 00:49:47,416
to learn more about these

1114
00:49:47,766 --> 00:49:48,976
All right.
